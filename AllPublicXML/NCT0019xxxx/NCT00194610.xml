  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with interstitial cystitis have been well documented to have pelvic floor muscle
      tenderness as well as pain on bladder distension. Some investigators have even suggested that
      pelvic floor muscle pain is primarily the cause of bladder problems.

      Botulinum toxin A causes muscle relaxation by inhibiting the acetylcholine release at the
      neuromuscular junction. It has been shown that this mechanism relieves pain in a number of
      muscle spasm-related syndromes.

      Because, at present, there is little effective therapy available for patients with
      interstitial cystitis, the researchers want to determine if botulinum toxin A will relieve
      bladder and pelvic pain in these patients.

      Screening Visit:

      After being screened by her medical provider, the patient will be given the opportunity to
      ask questions about the study. She will then be asked to read and sign the consent and then
      be randomized.

      Then, for women of childbearing age, a pregnancy test will be done.

      Next, we will ask the patient to fill out baseline study forms and she will be given a
      Voiding Diary. She will also be asked to provide a urine sample which will be processed for
      chemistry and culture.

      Injection Visit:

      This visit will be scheduled one week after the Screening Visit. First, a standard history
      and physical will be done. Then the clinician will proceed with the injection. The subject
      will receive an injection of not more than 5 ml of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine at the
      site of the botulinum toxin A injection.

      Next, 25 units of Botox will be injected, via the transvaginal route, on either side of the
      bladder neck. The remaining 50 units will be injected (in 2 - 25 unit doses) into other
      pelvic sites that the patient has identified as tender during the patient examination.

      1 Month Post Injection Mailing: The patient will be mailed a packet containing follow-up
      questionnaires and asked to mail them back upon completion.

      6 Week Urine Collection Visit: Two weeks after receiving her study injection, we will ask the
      patient to go to the Urology Clinic and provide a urine sample.

      2 Month Post Injection Mailing: Same as 1 Month Post Injection Visit.

      3 Month Post Visit: The subject will be asked to fill out follow-up questionnaires and will
      be asked to turn in her last set of Voiding Diaries.
