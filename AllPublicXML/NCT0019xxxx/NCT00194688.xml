  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the utility of a breath ammonia sensing device. In this study we
      will assess the effect of H. pylori infection on breath ammonia levels by measuring whether
      there is a change in the pattern or quantity of breath ammonia seen in H. pylori positive
      patients compared to H. pylori negative patients.

    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will undergo testing for H. pylori infection using a 14-C urea breath
      test, and the results will be compared to an experimental ammonia breath test. The breath
      sample will be collected by an investigational device that the patient will be exposed to
      consisting of a plastic mouth-piece which is attached to a T-tubing section having a side-arm
      port through which a fiberoptic ammonia sensor is inserted inside the tube. To meet the Phase
      II specific aim, the scope of the clinical trials is expanded addressing the following
      specific objectives:

        -  Test refinements of the sensing system (hardware, software, &amp; breath test device)

        -  Determine whether a urea dose-response effect exists following urea ingestion,

        -  Define the optimal cutoff values for expired breath ammonia to allow optimal
           discrimination of H. pylori infected vs. uninfected persons.

        -  Determine the appropriate time interval for breath ammonia testing following urea
           ingestion.

        -  Determine whether there is a change in breath ammonia level after H. pylori treatment.
