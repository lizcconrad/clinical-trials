      This study investigates the influence of two different insulin regimens, twice-daily insulin
      lispro low mix (LM) and once-daily insulin glargine, on perceived physical, mood, and
      cognitive symptoms as well as cognitive-motor task performance in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
