  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin (5-HT) is important in mood regulation and is believed to play a major role in the
      pathophysiology of major depression (MD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are
      currently the most widely used drugs for the treatment of depression. Patients with bipolar
      disorder (BD) who are treated for depression with SSRIs might develop mania, which is
      believed to be triggered by antidepressant treatment. Rapid tryptophan depletion (RTD) has
      been shown to induce transient depressive symptoms in remitted depressed patients treated
      with SSRIs. In remitted manic patients treated with lithium, RTD does not seem to have
      clinical effects. However, RTD was not studied in acutely manic patients and could
      theoretically have antimanic properties. In this double blind randomized placebo controlled
      study RTD will be used as a tool to assess the role of 5-HT in mania and will be evaluated
      for its antimanic properties and potential use as augmentation to drug treatment in acute
      mania.
