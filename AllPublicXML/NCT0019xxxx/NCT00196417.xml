  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised, double blind trial in non-intensive care trauma patients comparing unfractionated
      heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
      (HIT).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind trial including trauma patients with need for thrombosis
      prophylaxis with heparin. Patients receive either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).

      Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies are measured on days 1 and 10. There are
      daily platelet counts. On discharge an ultrasound doppler of the lower extremities is
      performed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

      Three months after discharge every patient is answering a questionnaire about thromboembolic
      complications following discharge.

      The key questions of the study are whether the two heparins cause HIT-antibodies in differing
      frequencies, and if yes, whether these differences lead to different clinical outcomes.
