  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial and multi-centered study with a 2-arm design. The
      treatment group will receive topical skin adhesive for skin closure of their wound and the
      control will receive sutures. Subjects will be assessed at follow-up visits. Patients are
      required to maintain a diary postpartum.
