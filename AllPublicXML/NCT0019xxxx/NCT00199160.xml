        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients (18 years old and above), with a histologically proven,
             measurable, locally recurrent, and/or metastatic head and neck tumor.

          -  &gt; 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy

          -  &gt; 3 weeks since prior therapy with biological agents (Interleukin-2 [IL-2],
             interferon, other molecular-targeted therapies [except Ras/Raf inhibitors]).

          -  Performance status &lt; 2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  At least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT)-scan or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Adequate liver, pancreatic, renal, and coagulation function

          -  A slide or paraffin-block from a tumor biopsy MUST be available at the time of
             screening. If the original diagnostic biopsy is not available at the time of
             screening, an additional biopsy is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe preexisting conditions

          -  Evidence of bone marrow suppression

          -  Frequent vomiting or medical condition, which could interfere with oral medication
             intake

          -  Lack of resolution of all toxic manifestations of prior chemotherapy, biologic, or
             radiation therapy (alopecia excluded).

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness.

          -  Previous exposure to a Ras/Raf inhibitor

          -  Previous malignancy (except for cervical carcinoma in situ, adequately treated basal
             cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumors [Ta, Tis and T1] or other malignancies
             curatively treated &gt; 2 years prior to entry)

          -  Congestive heart failure

          -  Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmics

          -  Active coronary artery disease or ischaemia

          -  Active clinically serious bacterial or fungal infections

          -  Known brain or meningeal metastases

          -  Patients with seizure disorder requiring medication (such as anti-epileptics)

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in
             association with this trial

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test.

          -  Concurrent anti-cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy is excluded

          -  Significant surgery within four weeks prior to start of study drug

          -  Investigational drug therapy outside of this trial, or any chemotherapy during or
             within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug

          -  Myelosuppressive radiotherapy within four weeks prior to start of study drug
             (short-course non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy may be allowed based on approval of
             principal investigators)

          -  Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or use of grapefruit
             juice
