  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed
      with peptides or tumor lysate in combination with adjuvant cytokines can induce a measurable
      immune response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to evaluate the
      clinical effect (objective response rate) of the vaccination regime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients receive vaccination with tumor antigen pulsed autologous monocyte-derived
      mature dendritic cells with a fixed interval. The dendritic cells are generated from
      leukapheresis products and frozen after antigen loading.

      HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; survivin and
      telomerase peptides. HLA A2 negative patients are treated with KLH and tumorlysate pulsed DC;
      autologous or allogeneic. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106
      peptide/lysate pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week
      intervals. Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response
      after 6 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is
      applied by intradermal injection near the inguinal region. IL-2 2 MIU s.c. day 2-6 and
      Thymosin alpha 1 (Zadaxin®, SciClone) 1,6 mg s.c. twice a week are used for adjuvants. Scans
      and re-staging tests are performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.

    <description>DC vaccination regime consists of primary 10 intradermal injections of 1-2 weeks interval (q1w x 4 → q2w x 6). HLA-A2 positive patients are treated with survivin and telomerase peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, and HLA-A2 negative patients are treated with allogeneic tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells i.d. 1,6 mg Thymosin alpha 1 (Zadaxin®, SciClone) is administered s.c. twice a week and from the 2nd vaccine, 2 MIU Interleukin-2 is administered s.c. on day 2-6.</description>
