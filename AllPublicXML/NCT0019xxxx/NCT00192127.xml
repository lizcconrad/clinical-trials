      This study is to assess the safety of a bivalent vaccine of two new 6:2 influenza virus
      reassortants in healthy adults prior to the release of the trivalent vaccine (FluMist)
      containing them.

      The primary study objective is to assess the safety of a bivalent vaccine of two new 6:2
      influenza virus reassortants in healthy adults prior to the release of the trivalent vaccine
      (FluMist) containing them. Safety will be demonstrated by similar fever rates (oral
      temperature ≥101°F Days 0-7) in vaccine and placebo recipients.

             hemoglobinopathies which required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during
             the preceding year;

          -  Acute febrile (&gt;100.0°F oral) and/or respiratory illness, including cough or sore
             throat, within the 14 days prior to enrollment;

          -  Hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein;

             expected enrollment in another investigational trial during this study;

          -  Chronic or regular use of antipyretic or analgesic medication on a daily or every
             other day basis; Notes: A daily dose of 81 mg of aspirin is not considered a

             those biologically capable, a urine pregnancy test must be performed on the day of
             vaccination with a negative result);

          -  Breastfeeding or lactating women;
