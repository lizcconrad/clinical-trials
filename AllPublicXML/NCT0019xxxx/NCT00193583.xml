  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study we will characterize the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      and dose-limiting toxicity of weekly bolus topotecan when administered in combination with
      two different dosing schedules of carboplatin. We will also evaluate any antitumor activity
      of these combination regimens.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

        -  Topotecan + Carboplatin

      In order to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen to progress into future phase II
      trials, two different dosing schedules of topotecan and carboplatin will be utilized (ARM I
      and ARM II). Patients will be accrued to both treatment arms simultaneously.
