  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of the recent supply shortages in the U.S., as well as an anticipated increase in
      demand during the coming years, GSK Biologicals is pursuing licensure of Fluarix in the U.S.
      under the accelerated approval process; marketing approval most likely will be granted before
      the start of this clinical trial. GSK proposes to support U.S. licensure of Fluarix with this
      confirmatory post-marketing study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a
      single dose of Fluarix in preventing influenza in adults during the 2005/2006 Influenza
      season.
