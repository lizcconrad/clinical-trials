  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown the importance of Telephone follow-up in reducing hospital
      readmissions for heart failure. Therefore, we aimed in this cohort to investigate whether
      telephone follow-up with patients discharged from the general internal department improves
      patients' satisfaction, increases compliance to treatment and reduces adverse effects.
      Patients are recruited from the department of general internal medicine who gave informed
      consent and could communicate. Patients are interviewed by during hospital stay, one and
      three months later. This group will be compared with patients that are not interviewd by
      phone aftert hospital discharge.
