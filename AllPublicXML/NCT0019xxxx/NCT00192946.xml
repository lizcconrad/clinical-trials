  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with broad QRS complexes on electrocardiogram (ECG), the delayed electrical
      activation of the left heart chamber will cause abnormal contraction.This has been shown to
      be possible to treat by a special pacemaker treatment which includes pacing of the left heart
      chamber (= CRT treatment).

      In this study the researchers will investigate the effect of acute CRT treatment in the early
      phase after open heart surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bundle branch block have a delayed electrical activation of the left ventricle
      causing abnormal contractility of the left ventricle.

      We hypothesize that patients may benefit from short term (= 72 hours) CRT (Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy) in the early phase after open heart surgery.

      Patients: reduced LV function and bundle branch block.

      Study type: randomisation to CRT versus standard postoperative treatment

      Study variables: cardiac output, echocardiographic measures, p-BNP and hours with inotropic
      therapy.
