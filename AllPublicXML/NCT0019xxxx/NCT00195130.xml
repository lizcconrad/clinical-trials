  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective study is to develop a new method of classifying the
      prognosis of ambulatory patients according to their risk of long term mortality,
      institutionalization, morbidity (including the deterioration of pre-existing conditions or
      development of new problems) and functional deterioration.

      Specifically, from a random sample of 2000 patients taken from a cohort of established
      patients followed for at least three years in a general medicine practice, the objectives
      are:

        1. to identify the demographic, clinical, and functional status variable that predict the
           risk of death, morbid events (e.g., the development of new complications or
           deterioration of existing conditions), or the deterioration in functional status using a
           half of the cohort chosen at random;

        2. to combine these findings into a prognostic scale that can be employed in routine
           clinical practice; and

        3. to validate the performance of this scale in the second half of the cohort.

      There are no interventions in this study. Patients already under medical care by Cornell
      physicians will be enrolled. The only requirements for patients are to complete the
      questionnaires on an annual basis.
