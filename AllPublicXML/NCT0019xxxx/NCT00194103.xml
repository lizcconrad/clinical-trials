  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of extended telephone monitoring
      for alcohol-dependent patients receiving intensive outpatient treatment. It is hypothesized
      that telephone monitoring will produce better alcohol use outcomes relative to treatment as
      usual. It is also hypothesized that adaptive telephone monitoring plus brief counseling will
      produce better alcohol use outcomes over time relative to telephone monitoring plus feedback
      only.
