    <textblock>
      Open label single arm phase II study of Pemetrexed plus Oxaliplatin in patients with advanced
      gastric carcinoma not previously treated with palliative chemotherapy. 43 Patients will be
      enrolled in this local trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      response rate of the treatment.Schedule for this study is as follows: 6 cycles/21 days of
      Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 followed by Oxaliplatin 120 mg/m2. This study will also include
      pharmacogenomic and pharmacogenetic investigations in order to assess determinants of
      efficacy and toxicity of the treatment with Pemetrexed and Oxaliplatin in the study
      population.
