      The primary objective for the study is to test the hypothesis that sertraline plus alprazolam
      XR will result in superior early stabilization of primary care PD patients versus
      sertraline/placebo over a 12-week treatment period. The secondary objectives of the study are
      a) to assess withdrawal symptoms during alprazolam XR taper (weeks 5-7 of the 12-week trial)
      and after discontinuation, b) to compare physical health outcomes, medical services
      utilization, and cost-effectiveness of the two study interventions across the 12-week
      treatment period and subsequent three month maintenance treatment with sertraline alone, and
      c) to assess whether early co-administration of sertraline/ alprazolam XR will result in
      greater maintenance of treatment response than sertraline/placebo over the three months
      following the 12 week acute treatment program.
