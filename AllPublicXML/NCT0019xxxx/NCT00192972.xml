  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both segmental, ostial and circumferential, extra-ostial pulmonary vein (PV) isolation have
      been proven effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

      In this study patients with symptomatic paroxystic or persistent AF were randomised to one of
      the above mentioned ablation methods. The primary endpoints were recurrent AF and recurrence
      of left atrium-PV conduction.

      Both segmental, ostial and circumferential, extra-ostial pulmonary vein (PV) isolation have
      been proven effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

      In this study with symptomativ paroxystic or persistent AF were randomised to one of the
      above mentioned ablation methods. Each patient was allowed a maximum of two ablation
      procedures. Holter monitoring for 14-days periods will be performed at 3 months after
      ablation. The patiens are seen at out-patient visits at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the
      ablation procedure.

      Primary endpoints were recurrent AF and recurrence of left atrium-PV conduction.

      Secondary endpoints were:

        -  safety

        -  resumption of LA-PV conduction

        -  alterations in neurohormones

        -  socio-economics aspects(cost effectiveness)

        -  changes in inflammatory markers

        -  quality of life

        -  alterations in signal averaged P wawe signals

        -  evaluation of the predictive value of these variables to predict recurrence of AF
