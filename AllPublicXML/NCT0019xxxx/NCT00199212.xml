      The main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of the combination of the
      proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and to
      determine the best dose of bortezomib to combine with two trastuzumab schedules, weekly and
      3-weekly.

      Phase 1 study to determine the feasibility of the combination of the proteasome inhibitor
      bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) with trastuzumab (Herceptin) given either weekly or 3-weekly.

      Additionally, hints about efficacy of the combination will be looked upon.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female gender

          2. Age &gt;= 18 years

          3. ECOG performance status &lt; 2

          4. Histologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer

          5. Locally advanced and/or metastatic disease

          6. Life expectancy of three months or longer

          7. No concurrent second malignancy (except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin, in situ carcinoma of the cervix or contralateral breast cancer). Any prior
             second malignancy must be in remission for &gt;= 5 years (except for contralateral breast
             cancer).

          8. No other serious illness or medical condition including:

               -  History of documented congestive heart failure; angina pectoris requiring
                  antianginal medication; evidence of recent (&lt; 6 months) transmural infarction on
                  electrocardiogram (ECG); poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic &gt; 180 mmHg
                  or diastolic greater than 100 mmHg); clinically significant valvular heart
                  disease; or high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias.

               -  Chronic lung disease

               -  History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders that would prohibit
                  the understanding and giving of informed consent, including psychotic disorders,
                  mental retardation, and dementia.

               -  Active concurrent infection

          9. No symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases

         10. No rapidly progressive visceral metastases requiring immediate chemotherapy

         11. No concurrent anti-cancer treatment is allowed.

         12. Prior investigational biological agents are allowed, with the exception of anti-HER-2
             therapy for any reason.

         13. Previous hormonal therapy is allowed, as adjuvant and/or for metastatic breast cancer
             (MBC).

         14. Adjuvant and MBC chemotherapy allowed, provided that a minimum of 4 weeks interval has
             elapsed between last chemotherapy administration and first study drug dose. All
             patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, could benefit from single agent
             Herceptin® and are not considered suitable for treatment with chemotherapy plus
             Herceptin® can be considered for this protocol.

         15. A maximum cumulative dose of previous doxorubicin &lt; 360 mg/m2 or a maximum cumulative
             dose of epirubicin &lt; 720 mg/m2

         16. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates is allowed, however if bisphosphonates are started
             during the trial for worsening bone pain, patients should be assessed for possible
             progressive disease.

         17. Adequate organ function as defined by:

               -  Neutrophils &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Transaminases &lt;= 2.5 x ULN or &lt;= 5 x ULN if liver metastasis

               -  Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

         18. Overexpression of HER-2 in the invasive component of the primary tumor, according to
             one of the following definitions:

               -  3+ overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or

               -  2+ overexpression by IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test
                  demonstrating c-erbB2 gene amplification (ratio of c-erbB2 gene signals to
                  centromere 17 signals &gt; 2)

         19. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 50% measured by multiple gated
             acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiography

         20. Evaluable or uni-dimensionally measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

         21. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and
             be willing to use acceptable methods of birth control.

         22. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.

         23. Before patient registration/randomization, informed consent must be given according to
             International Conference of Harmonization/European Union Good Clinical Practice
             (ICH/EU GCP), and national/local regulations.
