      The purpose of this study is

        1. to determine the correct dose for intramuscular administration

        2. to compare the frequency of antibody formation after intramuscular administration of
           native E.coli asparaginase and PEG-asparaginase during two treatment courses in the
           treatment of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asparaginase is used in the treatment of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. Approximately 1/3
      of the patients develops blocking antibodies against native E.coli asparaginase during the
      second exposure, so that they do not benefit from treatment and thus may have a worse
      prognosis.

      PEG-asparaginase is less immunogenic so that fewer patients may develop antibodies during the
      second exposure.

      There is no published study about the antibody formation after treatment of children with
      PEG-asparaginase during two treatment courses.

      The first part of the study is a description of the pharmacokinetics of PEG-asparaginase
      after intramuscular administration in order to determine the correct dose.

      The second part of the study is a comparison of antibody formation during two treatment
      courses after intramuscular administration og native E.coli asparaginase and
      PEG-asparaginase.

      Other side effects than antibodies will be registered during treatment with PEG-asparaginase.
      Finally comparison of the 5-year EFS between the groups (native E.coli asparaginase and
      PEG-asparaginase as well as patients who have and have not developed antibodies) will be
      evaluated.
