      This study will determine the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with divalproex and
      lithium for treating mania in people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder and a substance
      abuse disorder.

      Longitudinal Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Divalproex and Lithium in Dual
      Diagnosis Bipolar Rapid Cycling: This study recruits males and females age 18 and older who
      currently meet diagnostic criteria for rapid cycling bipolar disorder (type I or II) and who
      have met the criteria for substance abuse or dependence of cocaine, marijuana and/or alcohol
      within the past six months. Patients are initially stabilized on dual therapy of lithium and
      depakote and then randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either lithium monotherapy
      or continued dual therapy. Patients remain in the study for six months or until they
      experience a relapse. Patients in this study are required to bring a friend or family member
      to all study visits as well as attend chemical dependency services. This study is sponsored
      by the NIMH. Subjects receive study-related care at no cost.

             lithium in the past will be excluded, whereas patients who have had partial responses
             to lithium will be permitted into the study.

          -  Patients with a prior history of seizure disorder, cerebral vascular disease,

             abnormalities, EEG abnormalities with frank paroxysmal activity or a previous CT/MRI
             scan of the brain with gross structural abnormalities.

          -  Patients who require anticoagulant drug therapy.

          -  Patients who have uncontrolled gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological or hematological disease. Patients with
             alcohol-related liver disease as reflected by diffuse elevations in liver functions
             tests exceeding the upper limits of the normal range by 50% will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Patients who have received haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate within the
             last 10 weeks.

          -  Patients who have a central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm, uncontrolled metabolic,
             demyelinating or progressive disorder; active CNS infection; or any progressive
