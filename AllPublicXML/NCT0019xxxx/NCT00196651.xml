      HIV-specific immune responses are preserved in patients treated early during primary
      infection. The trial evaluated whether the addition to HAART of IL-2 alone or combined with
      an immunization procedure might enhance HIV immune responses and improve viral control after
      HAART discontinuation.Patients treated with HAART are randomized to 3 arms:arm1 HAART alone;
      arm2 with 5 cycles of IL-2 at wk0 ,8 ,16 ,24 and 32;arm3 4 injections of Alvac-HIV 1433 and
      LIPO-6T at wk0,4,8 followed by 3 cycles of IL-2 at w 16, 24 and 32. HAART is stopped at wk 40
      in patient with undetectable plasma viral load. Viral loads and HIV-specific responses are
      monitored during the therapeutic period and after HAART interruption until w52. HAARTis
      rei-initiated with viral failure.
