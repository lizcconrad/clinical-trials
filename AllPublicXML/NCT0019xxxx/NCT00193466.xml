  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter trial, we will investigate the use of fludarabine plus rituximab,
      followed by Campath-1H, in previously untreated patients with CLL/SLL. Patients who are
      elderly, or who are considered unlikely to tolerate this combination therapy well, will
      receive single agent rituximab followed by Campath-1H.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will receive:

      Fludarabine + Rituximab + CAMPATH-1H

      Patients who are judged by the investigator not to be candidates for fludarabine due to
      advanced age, marginal performance status or coexistent medical conditions will receive
      rituximab alone followed by CAMPATH-1H.
