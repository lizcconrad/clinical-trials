      To perform a variety of assays on blood, nasal washes, and cells obtained from healthy
      children for the purposes of further investigation of immune responses generated by influenza
      virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live, cold-adapted (liquid CAIV-T; Wyeth Lederle
      Vaccines, Marietta, PA).

      â€¢ To assess nasal swab specimens to detect vaccine virus shedding.

    <textblock>
      This was a phase II, prospective, randomized, partially-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      outpatient study conducted at multiple sites throughout the US in healthy children aged 6
      months to less than 36 months. Parents/guardians of subjects were asked to read and sign the
      informed consent before any study-related procedures were performed. Subjects at each study
      site were sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 separate blood sample groups referred to as
      &quot;cellular immunity&quot; or &quot;antibody secreting cell&quot;. Subjects within each blood sample group
      were then randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single intranasal dose of CAIV-T 10^7 FFU per dose,
      CAIV-T 10^5 FFU per dose, placebo or a commercially-available injectable trivalent influenza
      vaccine (TIV).

          -  with any serious chronic disease (e.g., with signs of cardiac or renal failure or
             severe malnutrition), including progressive neurological disease;

          -  with Down's syndrome or other known cytogenetic disorders;

          -  with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids, or cytotoxic agents
             (see Section 4.2.2);

          -  have an immunosuppressed or an immunocompromised individual living in the same
             household;

          -  with a documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein or any other
             component of the study vaccine, placebo or TIV;

          -  who, at anytime prior to study enrollment, receives any influenza vaccine (commercial
             or investigational);

          -  with any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere
             with interpretation of the study results.
