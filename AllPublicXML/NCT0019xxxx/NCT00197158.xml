      GSK Biologicals' currently licensed multidose hepatitis B vaccine will be compared to the
      currently licensed monodose hepatitis B vaccine in a population with well documented
      hepatitis B immunological response to the vaccine (Belgium).

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  A male or female &gt;= 18 years of age

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. either
             surgically sterilized or one year post-menopausal; or, if of childbearing potential,
             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days
             prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such
             precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
             vaccine during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. (For
             corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to
             0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine.

          -  Previous vaccination against hepatitis B

          -  History of hepatitis B infection

          -  Known exposure to hepatitis B within the previous 6 weeks

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine(s).

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered to
             persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection with
             or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e. Oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C (99.5°F) /
             Axillary temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F).

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening
             tests.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study
             period. Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
             precautions during the study period.
