  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the combination of bevacizumab, and erlotinib in patients with
      adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Bevacizumab and
      erlotinib are relatively well-tolerated and have non-overlapping toxicity profiles. This
      trial will be one of the first clinical trials to evaluate a combination of targeted agents
      in the treatment of a solid tumor.
