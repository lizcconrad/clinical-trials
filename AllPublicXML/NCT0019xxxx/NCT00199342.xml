    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalating cohort study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      KW-2871 (in dose cohorts of 60, 80, and 100 mg/m2) when administered with a specified
      premedication regimen (ranitidine, diphenhydramine, and dexamethasone). KW-2871 will be
      administered at 14-day intervals.

    <textblock>
      This open label study consists of two parts. Part I, the Phase I component of the study, will
      be conducted at a single center, and will enroll up to 18 patients with histologically
      documented Stage IV melanoma (per the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] criteria)
      that is not currently amenable to surgical resection or other therapies.

      A specified premedication regimen consisting of ranitidine, diphenhydramine, and
      dexamethasone will be administered to all patients 30 minutes prior to infusion of any dose
      of KW-2871.

      Planned doses of KW-2871 are 60 mg/m2, 80 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2

      After identification of the MTD, 30 patients will be enrolled at that dose level in Part II
      of the study. If no MTD is identified after treatment with the 100 mg/m2 dose level, the dose
      administered in Part II of the study will be 100 mg/m2. If the MTD is determined as 60 mg/m2,
      this study will be closed to further patient accrual and will not proceed to Part II.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Patients with documented Stage IV melanoma (histologically- or cytologically-proven,
             as per AJCC criteria) that is not currently amenable to surgical resection (due to
             either medical contraindication or non-resectability of tumor)

          3. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease, in accordance with the RECIST
             criteria.

          4. Failure of at least one, but no more than 3, standard treatment regimen(s) for
             metastatic disease

          5. Patients must have adequate end-organ function including:

               1. Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL

               2. ANC &gt; 1500/mm3
