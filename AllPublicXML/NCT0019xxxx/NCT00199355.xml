      To establish the efficacy of 20 mg/d and 40mg/d doses of istradefylline for reducing the
      percentage of OFF time in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with
      levodopa. Patients who meet entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to double
      blind treatment with oral doses of 20 or 40mg/d istradefylline or matching placebo. Patients
      will be treated for 12 weeks and will have interim visits and end of treatment visit to
      assess the efficacy and safety of istradefylline.
