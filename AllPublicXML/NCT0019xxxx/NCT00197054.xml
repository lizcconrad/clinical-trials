  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02A developed by GSK Biologicals demonstrated 30%
      efficacy against clinical episodes of malaria and approximately 58% efficacy against severe
      malaria disease. As a potential improvement to RTS,S/AS02A, another candidate vaccine
      RTS,S/AS01B is being developed in parallel in collaboration with the Walter Reed Army
      Institute of Research (WRAIR). This study will be the first administration of the RTS,S/AS01B
      vaccine to the African adults to establish safety and immunogenicity in this population.
      Preliminary indication of vaccine efficacy with this adjuvant will be established by
      monitoring the time to the first infection with Plasmodium falciparum.

      The study comprises of 3 groups and the participating subjects will be randomly allocated to
      one of the three groups. The first group will receive RTS,S/AS01B, the second group will
      receive RTS,S/AS02A and the third group will receive rabies vaccine. Immunization will be
      given by IM injection on 0, 1, 2 month schedule. Infants will be followed up daily for 7 days
      for solicited symptoms and 30 days for unsolicited symptoms after each vaccine dose. Serious
      adverse events will be recorded throughout the study period. A week prior to Dose 3, subjects
      will be treated with a licenced anti-malarial drug. Starting from two weeks after Dose 3, the
      subjects will be monitored for a 14-week duration for detection of malaria infection.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female volunteers aged between 18 and 35 years at the time of first

             precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  If a subject plans to take vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days
             of the first dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of tetanus toxoid will be excluded
