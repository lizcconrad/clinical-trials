  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with upper ureteral or renal stones will be randomized to undergoing ureteroscopy
      with or without a ureteral access sheath. The sheath is designed to facilitate ureteroscope
      insertion and re-insertion, thus allowing fragments to be basketed out. Stone free rates at 3
      months will be determined between the two groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of the ureteral access sheath with ureteroscopy
      will result in improved stone free rates at 3 months compared to ureteroscopy without use of
      a sheath.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Upper ureteral (proximal to iliac vessels/iliac crest) calculi;

          -  Renal calculi;

          -  Normal renal function;

          -  Any stone composition;

          -  Single or multiple stones(planned treatment of all stones at this surgery);

          -  Age &gt; 18 years;

          -  Able and willing to return treatment centre for follow-up visits; AND

          -  Signed study consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ureteric calculi distal to the level of the iliac vessels/iliac crest;

          -  Failed ureteroscopy for same stone (i.e. has to be the first ureteroscopic procedure
             for this stone, however a prior failed extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) is
             acceptable);

          -  Bilateral ureteroscopy;

          -  If an adjunctive procedure is planned post ureteroscopy (e.g. percutaneous
             nephrolithotomy, SWL) (i.e. it is known preoperatively that a ureteroscopic procedure
             will not render the patient stone free and that ancillary procedures will be
             necessary);

          -  If in the investigators opinion, enrollment would be not be appropriate; OR

          -  Pregnancy
