  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S-1 is a novel oral fluorouracil antitumor drug that consists of tegafur which is a prodrug
      of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); 5-chloro-2,4-dihydropyridine (CDHP), which inhibits
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity; and potassium oxonate (Oxo), which reduces
      gastrointestinal toxicity. 5-FU is metabolized by CYP2A6 and DPD. In this study, the
      researchers investigate the influences of differences in activities of CYP2A6 and DPD on
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of S-1 and clinical outcomes in digestive organ cancer
      patients treated with S-1.
