  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients at least 18 years of age, with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB)
      will be enrolled into the study and receive one dose of Aurexis® intravenously on Study Day
      1, and will be followed until Study Day 57. Aurexis is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
      is designed to combat Staphylococcus aureus.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of standard antibiotic
      therapy, plus Aurexis or Placebo for treatment of (SAB). Additionally, certain tests and
      measurements will be conducted to preliminarily determine if Aurexis demonstrates any benefit
      to these patients.
