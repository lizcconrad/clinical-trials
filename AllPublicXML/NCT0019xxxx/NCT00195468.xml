      Compare kidney function as measured by calculated creatinine clearance (using the method by
      Nankivell)1 at 12 months after transplantation in subjects receiving induction therapy with
      cyclosporine microemulsion (CsA) and Rapamune followed by CsA dose reduction (Group I) with
      subjects receiving induction therapy with CsA and Rapamune followed by CsA discontinuation
      (Group II).
