  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gemcitabine-paclitaxel and gemcitabine-platinum combinations have shown promise in the
      treatments of MBC; however, the optimal dosing schedules for these combinations have not yet
      been determined. The primary objective of this study is to compare the response rates of the
      gemcitabine-paclitaxel, gemcitabine-carboplatin, and gemcitabine-cisplatin combinations when
      administered on a biweekly schedule in metastatic breast cancer.

    <description>Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <time_frame>randomization to date of documented disease progression, death on study, start of non-protocol-specified anticancer therapy, or therapy discontinuation due to toxicity, whichever occurred first (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTTF event was defined as documented disease progression, death on study, start of non-protocol-specified anticancer therapy, or therapy discontinuation due to toxicity. TTTF for patients who were still participating in study without treatment failure at time of analysis were treated as censored at date of last tumor assessment. TTTF for patients who had discontinued from therapy for reasons other than toxicity and who did not experience treatment failure prior to therapy discontinuation were treated as censored on day of study discontinuation.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to measured progressive disease or death (tumor assessments were performed every 4 cycles during study therapy, or 3 months during post-therapy until disease progression, death, or up to 24 months after randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomizaton to the date of documented disease progression or death on study, whichever occurred first. PFS for participants who discontinued from the study or who had not progressed at the time of analysis were treated as censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>time of response to progressive disease or death (tumor assessments were performed every 4 cycles during study therapy, or 3 months during post-therapy until disease progression, death, or up to 24 months after randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured from time of first documentation of complete response (disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions), until date of PFS. Duration of response was censored on day of last tumor assessment for patients who had not progressed or who had discontinued study at time of analysis, and for cases where investigator determined patient had progressive disease and discontinued study therapy and/or started a new, non-protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy before documented disease progression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to date of death from any cause (up to 34 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. Survival time is censored at the date of last contact for patients who are still alive or lost to follow-up.</description>
