  <brief_summary>

      - The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of CAIV-T in a diverse Asian
      population aged from 6 months to less than 36 months, in tropical and temperate climates,
      against culture-confirmed influenza illness. In addition, the trial provides the opportunity
      to investigate the efficacy of CAIV-T over multiple influenza seasons, and to investigate the
      effect of CAIV-T on acute otitis media.
