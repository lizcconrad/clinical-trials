  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to explore the feasibility of inhaled xenon for sedation in terms
      of its effect on postoperative cognitive function in elderly, in comparison with the
      postoperative cognitive function found after IV propofol sedation in the same population.The
      secondary objectives were designed to assess the feasibility of xenon sedation in terms of
      its effects on different neuropsycho-logical test variables, vital signs, sedation levels and
      safety in elderly orthopaedic subjects.

      Primary endpoint: - The primary efficacy parameter was a combined score based on the seven
      variables derived from four validated neuropsychological tests of cognitive function; Visual
      Verbal Learning test, Concept Shifting test, Stroop Color Word Interference test and Letter
      Digit Coding test. The parameter was used for comparing changes in test results between the
      screening and first postoperative follow-up testing for the treatment groups.Secondary
      endpoints:- Cognitive performance changes from baseline to the first post-operative follow-up
      judged separately for each of the seven variables from the changes in the test results.-
      Cognitive performance changes from baseline to the second postoperative follow-up judged
      separately and globally for each of the seven variables from the changes in test results.-
      Adequacy of ventilation (respiratory rate and pulse oximetry)- Adequacy of xenon sedation by
      monitoring depth of unconsciousness, signs of airway irritation, need for additional
      sedatives, time to recovery from anaesthesia. - Technical performance of xenon delivery
