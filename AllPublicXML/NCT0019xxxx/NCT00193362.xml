  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the three-drug combination
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine to the two-drug combination gemcitabine and
      vinorelbine in patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

        -  Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Gemcitabine

        -  Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Paclitaxel + Carboplatin +
      Gemcitabine) and 1 will receive treatment B (Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine). The study is not
      blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
