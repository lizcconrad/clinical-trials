        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Patients must have bilateral sensorimotor distal peripheral neuropathy attributable to
             diabetes mellitus

          -  Patients must have blood glucose control measured as HbA1c=&lt;11%

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

             distinguished from other etiologies

          -  Patients must not have a neurologic disease or neuropathy from a cause other than
             diabetes mellitus that would interfere with correct evaluation of symptomatic
             peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Patient currently has uncontrolled high blood pressure

          -  You have other medical problems that your doctor feels would make it unsafe for you to
