    <textblock>
      Patients with a clinically indicated sleep study will be enrolled in this study. They will
      have a diagnostic and a therapeutic sleep study with continuous positive airway pressure
      ventilation. For both studies a pH probe will be placed nasal to measure the amount of acidic
      reflux during each study. Baseline levels of reflux from the diagnostic sleep study will be
      compared to reflux episodes while on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation.
