             history, physical examination, and clinical judgment;

          -  whose parent or legal guardian had provided written informed consent after the nature
             of the study had been explained;

          -  who, along with their parent or legal guardian, were available for the duration of the
             study (42 days post-vaccination of first study dose or 42 days post-vaccination of
             supplemental dose of CAIV-T);

          -  whose parent/legal guardian could be reached by telephone by study staff for the

          -  who attended day care at least three days per week and four hours per day;

          -  who was one of at least 4 children in a contact group/playroom (at least 4 children in
             such a group were required to be randomized in the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  whose parents or legal guardians were perceived to be unreliable or unavailable for
             evaluation or study visits during the study period;

             severe malnutrition), including progressive neurological disease and asthma;

          -  with Down's syndrome or other known cytogenetic disorders;

          -  with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids;

          -  who received any blood products, including immunoglobulin, in the period from six
             months prior to vaccination through to the conclusion of the study;

          -  for whom there was intent to administer any other investigational vaccine or agent
             from one month prior to enrollment through to the conclusion of the study;

          -  with an immunosuppressed or compromised individual in the same playroom or living in
             the same household;

          -  who, at any time prior to entry into this study, received a dose of any influenza
             vaccine (commercial or investigational);

          -  with a respiratory illness with wheezing within two weeks prior to enrollment;

          -  who received aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or aspirin-containing products in the two
             weeks prior to enrollment or for whom use was anticipated during the study;

          -  who were administered any live virus vaccine within one month prior to enrollment or
             expected receipt of another live virus vaccine within one month of vaccination in this
             study;

          -  who were administered any inactivated vaccine within two weeks prior to enrollment or
             expected receipt of another inactivated vaccine within three weeks of vaccination in
             this study;

          -  with any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere
             with interpretation of the study results.
