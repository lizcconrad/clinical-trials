  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine has shown significant activity in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. Several studies have activity in patients of multiple lines of
      therapy, including patients that have been treated with prior taxane therapy. Overall
      responses have ranged from 30% to 79%. The major side effects of the combination chemotherapy
      have been neutropenia, anemia, asthenia, neuropathy, nausea, mucositis, and neutropenic fever
