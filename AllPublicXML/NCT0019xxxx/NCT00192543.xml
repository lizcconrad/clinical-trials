  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in patients on dialysis for end stage renal
      disease. Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants have been shown to be protective in the general
      population. A diet of fish and fruit, which will provide the fatty acids and the antioxidants
      is being tried in dialysis patients to assess the effect on cardiovascular disease in this
      high risk group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a devastating disease which affects Aboriginal Australians
      disproportionately: The average survival time for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory
      is 3.6 years from the onset of kidney failure, compared to 12.3 years for non-Aboriginal
      people. There has been a dramatic rise in incidence of kidney failure over the past 20 years,
      with the prevalence doubling every 4-5 years in many NT communities and other remote parts of
      Australia. Mortality for patients with ESRD is approximately 5 to 10 fold that of the general
      population, with heart disease accounting for approximately half of deaths.

      The aims of this study are to determine whether a dietary intervention of fish and fruit
      three times a week will decrease cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients on
      haemodialysis in Darwin and Alice Springs . There is a strong scientific rationale for this
      simple dietary intervention. Fish are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, believed to
      reduce the risk of heart attack. Fruit is a good source of anti oxidants and other chemicals
      that may amplify the beneficial effects of fish. Participants are randomized to either
      control and intervention groups according to their regular days of dialysis. Nutritional and
      cardiovascular status will be measured at commencement of the study and then at intervals of
      3, 6 and 12 months.

      Strategies have been incorporated into the project design to ensure understanding, informed
      consent and participation of Aboriginal people in a number of domains: the participant, their
      family, urban and remote communities, and service providers. If successful this intervention
      will result in changes to the clinical management of renal patients worldwide.
