  <brief_summary>

      To estimate the safety of NY-ESO-1 Plasmid DNA (pPJV7611) Cancer Vaccine given by PMED in
      patients with tumor type known to express NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 using frequency, severity, and
      duration of treatment-related adverse effects as endpoints.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with tumor type known to express NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen will be
      assigned to cohorts. NY-ESO-1 Plasmid DNA (pPJV7611) Cancer Vaccine will be administered by
      PMED at a pressure of 500 psi using the XR-1 Powderject delivery device. The 4 microgram
      dosage of NY-ESO-1 will be administered as 4 X 1 microgram PMEDs in close proximity.
      Similarly, the 8 microgram dosage will be administered as 8 X 1 microgram PMEDs. The third
      cohort of patients will receive the 8 microgram dosage as a cluster dosage of 4 doses (day 1,
      3, 5, 8) as 2 X 1 microgram PMEDs per day.

      Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, 2 weeks after each vaccination, prior to the
      second and third vaccination, and 4 weeks after the third vaccination for the assessment of
      clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology responses. Patients will be
      evaluated for toxicity throughout the study.

      DTH testing will be performed with NY-ESO-1 protein in all patients, with NY-ESO-1b peptide
      in HLA-A2+ patients and with NY-ESO-1 DP4 peptide in HLA-DP4+ patients at baseline and at the
      2-week visit following the first and third vaccinations.

      NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibodies will be assessed in all patients by ELISA using
      recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein. NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be assessed in all
      patients by tetramer and/or ELISPOT assays.

      Disease status will be assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after the third vaccination in
      patients with measurable disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for enrollment if they fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Histologically proven tumor type known to express NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 (prostate cancer,
             breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular cancer, synovial sarcoma,
             leiomyosarcoma, head and neck, lung cancer, esophageal, ovarian, neuroblastoma); or
             NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 positive tumors determined by reverse transcriptase and polymerase
             chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, preferably, or immunohistochemistry or expression of
             LAGE-1 by RT-PCR.

          2. Advanced disease and have declined, delayed, failed or completed standard therapy.

          3. Full recovery from surgery.

          4. Expected survival of at least 6 months.

          5. Karnofsky performance scale &gt;60.

          6. Adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver and immune functions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant heart disease (NYHA Class III or IV).

          2. Other serious illnesses, e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics or bleeding
             disorders, clinically significant liver or renal insufficiency requiring treatment.

          3. Patients with serious intercurrent illness, requiring hospitalization.

          4. Known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C positivity.

          5. History of autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, scleroderma). Vitiligo is not an exclusion
             criterion.

          6. Concomitant systemic treatment with corticosteroids, anti-histaminic drugs or
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Specific COX-2 inhibitors are permitted. Low
             dose aspirin is permitted. Topical or inhalational steroids are permitted.

          7. Evidence of skin disease (e.g. psoriasis, eczema or keloid formation) at the proposed
             administration site.

          8. Allergy to gold (including gold jewelry).

          9. History or evidence of chrysotherapy (gold salts).

         10. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to first dosing

         11. Other malignancy within 3 years prior to entry into the study, except for treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ and incidental prostate cancer on
             radical cystoprostatectomy specimen.

         12. Mental impairment, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the ability to
             give informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study.

         13. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessments.

         14. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
