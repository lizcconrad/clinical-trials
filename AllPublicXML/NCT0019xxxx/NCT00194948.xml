  <brief_summary>

      This study will determine the effectiveness of offering primary care patients their preferred
      treatment versus one that is less desirable in improving treatment adherence and outcome.

    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether offering primary care patients treatment that is congruent
      with their preferred first choice improves adherence and outcomes, in comparison to offering
      treatment that is not congruent with their preferred first choice. All subjects are offered a
      treatment with demonstrated efficacy, namely either the antidepressant medication
      escitalopram or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for 5 months. We hypothesize that patients who
      receive congruent treatment will be more likely to initiate treatment, adhere to treatment,
      and achieve depression remission.
