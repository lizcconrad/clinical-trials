      The primary objective of this study is to compare the 2-hour PPBG excursion following a
      standard test meal in insulin-requiring diabetic patients treated twice daily with human
      insulin mix 50/50, versus the 2-hour PPBG excursion in patients treated twice daily with
      insulin lispro mix 50/50.
