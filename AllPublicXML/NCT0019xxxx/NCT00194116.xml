      Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Divalproex Sodium ER in Bipolar I or Bipolar II Depression
      Previously Diagnosed and Treated as Recurrent Major Depression: This study recruits males and
      females aged 18 - 70 who currently meet diagnostic criteria for bipolar I or bipolar II
      disorder and are currently experiencing an episode of major depression. Patients are
      randomized to double-blind treatment with divalproex sodium ER or placebo and remain in the
      study for up to six weeks. This six-week double-blind treatment period is followed by an
      open-label treatment period of six months duration. This study is sponsored by Abbott
      Laboratories.

    <description>Tablets will be available in 250mg and 500mg strengths. Divalproex will be titrated to a minimum blood level of 50 mg/L. However, the investigators will titrate divalproex to the maximum tolerable dose with an expected average dose of 2000mg per day. By dosing in this manner, all subjects will have a minimum blood level of 50 mg/L, but the mean level is likely to be considerably higher.</description>
