    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia
      and moderate to severe manic episode.

      Olanzapine is among the many antipsychotic agents associated with weight gain . The mechanism
      for antipsychotic drug-related weight gain is not known, although antagonism of serotonin
      receptors, especially the 5HT2C , and histamine receptors has been hypothesized.

      The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy of a psychoeducational programme in
      managing the increased weight as a side effect of the olanzapine treatment.

      Interventions to prevent weight gain associated with olanzapine should at least include
      periodic monitoring and recommendations for changes in diet and physical activity.

      This is a phase IV, randomised, parallel study of subjects previously treated with olanzapine
      as antipsychotic monotherapy, which have shown an increase of B.M.I. &gt;7% from the beginning
      of antipsychotic treatment (assessed during the routine visits). For the first 12 weeks of
      the trial approximately 60 outpatients, enrolled in one site during a period of one year,
      will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups: olanzapine + psychoeducational
      programme or olanzapine alone. In the following 12 weeks of the study all patients undergo
      the psychoeducational programme. The efficacy of this programme will be assessed monitoring
      the mean difference from baseline to endpoint in total body weight and BMI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients, previously treated with olanzapine as antipsychotic monotherapy, which
             have shown a weight gain with an increase of BMI &gt;7% (assessed during the routine
             visits from the beginning of antipsychotic treatment).

          -  Male or female subjects at least 18 and no more than 65 years of age.

          -  Subjects must be considered reliable.

          -  Each subject must have a level of understanding sufficient to perform all tests and
             examinations required by the protocol.

          -  Each patient, (and a patient's legal representative if mandated by local law), must
             understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent document.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Serious, unstable illnesses such that death is anticipated within 1 year or intensive
             care unit hospitalization for the disease is anticipated within 6 months. This
             includes hepatic (specifically any degree of jaundice), renal, gastroenterologic,
             respiratory, cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic,
             neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic diseases (specifically current agranulocytosis
             with an absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 mm3).

          -  Prior treatment with any antipsychotic drugs associated to olanzapine.

          -  Judged clinically to be at significant suicidal or homicidal risk and/or agitated
             enough to necessitate use of restraints.
