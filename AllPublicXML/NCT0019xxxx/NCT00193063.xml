  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its remarkable activity as salvage treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer as
      well as the additive activity observed for gemcitabine administered in combination with
      trastuzumab, the clinical activity of the combination of gemcitabine administered with
      trastuzumab represents an exciting and ideal combination to further evaluate in Her 2
      over-expressing metastatic breast cancer patients.
