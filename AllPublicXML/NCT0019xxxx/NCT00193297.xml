  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of the combination of
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and topotecan in patients with previously untreated, stage III or IV
      epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma. We will also make a preliminary
      evaluation of the efficacy of this three drug regimen in the initial treatment of these
      patients.
