  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical data suggests that combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin is
      synergistic, and both drugs may be synergistic with trastuzumab. Additionally, recent
      clinical data suggest that the combination of gemcitabine with platinum is an active regimen
      in metastatic breast cancer. This study will test the combination of gemcitabine with
      carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients with Her2/neu overexpression
      will be stratified to receive trastuzumab in addition to gemcitabine and carboplatin.
