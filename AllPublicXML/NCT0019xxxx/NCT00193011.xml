  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of standard adjuvant treatment with CMF
      chemotherapy versus treatment with weekly docetaxel in patients with high-risk breast cancer
      who are 65 years of age and older or are poor candidates for anthracycline-containing
      regimens. This CMF regimen has decreased dose intensity and may be slightly less active in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer; however, the patient population in this trial has
      tolerated more intensive CMF regimens poorly in other trials.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

        -  Docetaxel

        -  Cyclophosphamide + Methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil

      This is not a blinded study so both the patient and the investigator will know which
      treatment has been assigned.

      Chemotherapy will be followed by breast and/or regional radiotherapy in appropriate patients,
      and by hormone therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years in patients who are estrogen-receptor
      positive. Patients who are considered poor candidates to receive tamoxifen may receive
      hormonal therapy with anastrazole.
