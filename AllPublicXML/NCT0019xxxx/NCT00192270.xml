      The study was designed to determine the number of doses of CAIV-T required to effectively
      immunize children and adolescents in the 6 to 17 year age group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicenter, outpatient study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of one or two doses of CAIV-T in
      children and adolescents between 6 and 17 years of age. Subjects were allocated to one of
      three study groups according to age at the time of enrollment: study group one consisted of
      subjects between 6 and 9 years of age, group two of subjects 10 to 12 years of age, and group
      three of subjects 13 to 17 years of age.

      Approximately 450 subjects (ie, 150 subjects per age group) participated in the study and
      were scheduled to receive two intranasal doses of CAIV-T separated by 35 ± 7 days in an
      open-label manner.

    <measure>The number of subjects achieving strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody seroconversion post Dose 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 35 post Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was evaluated by comparison of pre and post-vaccination strain-specific titers of serum HAI antibody. Seroconversion was defined as a four-fold or greater rise in serum HAI antibody titer.</description>

    <measure>The number of subjects reporting any reactogenicity event post dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0-10</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity events were predefined adverse events that could have occurred after vaccine administration. They included the following: fever (oral temperature &gt;= 38C), cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, sore throat, irritability, headache, chills, vomiting, decreased activity, decreased appetite, and muscle aches.</description>

    <measure>The number of subjects reporting any adverse event post dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0-10</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (or adverse experience, AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who was administered a study product.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of subjects reporting serious adverse events post dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0-42</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was considered serious (SAE) if it: resulted in death, regardless of cause; was life-threatening (subject was at risk of death as the event occurred); required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in the offspring of a vaccine recipient, where applicable).</description>
