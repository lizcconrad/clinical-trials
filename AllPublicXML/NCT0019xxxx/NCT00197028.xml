  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals is developing in partnership with the Program for Appropriate Technology in
      Health (PATH) Malaria Vaccine Initiative a candidate malaria vaccine for the routine
      immunization of infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer
      protection against malaria disease due to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The vaccine
      would also provide protection against infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).

      This trial is being carried out following the demonstration of efficacy of a previous version
      of the malaria candidate vaccine in children in Mozambique: there, the vaccine demonstrated
      approximately 30% efficacy against clinical episodes of malaria and approximately 58%
      efficacy against severe malaria disease.

      In order to integrate the malaria vaccine into the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)
      regimen, in malaria-endemic regions, for this trial, a 0.5 ml dose of GSK 257049 vaccine has
      been developed. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA
      Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      All infants participating in this phase I/IIb study will receive TETRActHib (a licensed
      diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis Haemophilus influenzae vaccine manufactured by Aventis Pasteur)
      by IM injection in their right thigh at 8, 12, and 16 weeks; They will be randomized to
      receive either the candidate malaria vaccine, GSK 257049 vaccine (0.5 ml dose) or Engerix-B
      (a licensed hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by GSK Biologicals) by IM injection in their
      left thigh at 10, 14, 18 weeks. Infants will be followed-up daily for 7 days after each
      vaccine dose for evaluation of safety and reactogenicity. There will be a 14-day follow-up
      period after each dose of TETRActHib and after Dose 1 and Dose 2 of GSK 257049 vaccine or
      Engerix-B, and a one month follow-up period after Dose 3 of GSK 257049 vaccine or Engerix-B
      for reporting unsolicited symptoms. Serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the 14
      month study period. A small amount of blood (2 ml = 1/2 teaspoon) will be obtained at four
      different time points to measure the immune response elicited by the vaccines administered
      during this study period. Preliminary indication of vaccine efficacy in this age group will
      be established by actively monitoring for infection with Plasmodium falciparum.
