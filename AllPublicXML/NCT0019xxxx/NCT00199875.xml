  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study that will only be carried out at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
      Center. Patients will receive a radiolabeled antibody, called Yttrium-90 chimeric G250
      (90Y-cG250).The goal of a phase 1 trial is to establish a safe dose range based on side
      effects;in other studies, these side effects have been reversible and lasted a short time
      (hours to days). If possible, the trial will also give us an idea of how well the drug might
      work in treating your disease.

      This is a Phase I dose escalation study using 90Y-DOTA-cG250 for treatment of patients with
      advanced kidney carcinoma. The initial group of patients will be treated with 0.2 mCi/Kg of
      yttrium-90. Subsequent treatments will be in 0.1 mCi/Kg increments, with the last cohort
      increasing by 0.05 mCi/Kg. At least three patients per dose level will be followed for up to
      8 weeks (or after recovery from toxicity) with imaging, biochemical, serological, and
      hematologic tests for toxicity. CT scans will be carried out at baseline and after 6-8 weeks
      (or after recovery from toxicity).

      Patients will initially receive 5 mCi/10 mg 111In-DOTA-cG250 antibody (an imaging dose).
      Whole body and blood measurements of radioactivity will be obtained on at least three
      occasions for one week to determine targeting and dosimetry. Therapeutic 90Y-DOTA-cG250 will
      be administered the following week, if there is evidence of In-111 cG250 targeting to lesions
      &gt; 2 cm detected on CT. Patients will be treated as outpatients and will receive only one
      treatment.
