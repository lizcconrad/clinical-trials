    <textblock>
      This study is a placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and tolerability of a novel
      antipsychotic medication, (773812) when given to schizophrenic patients for twenty-eight
      days. Assessments include blood sampling to determine drug concentrations, psychiatric
      assessments while under treatment, and movement assessments to evaluate potential side
      effects.
