  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability/safety of
      aripiprazole (Abilify) in children with subsyndromal symptoms of bipolar disorder who also
      have a parent with bipolar disorder and other family member with a mood disorder.

    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial that
      will last up to 12 weeks.

      This placebo-controlled portion will be followed by a 6-week open label
      extension/stabilization phase. In order to be eligible for participation in the
      extension/stabilization phase, subjects must: 1) in the investigator's opinion have had no
      dose-limiting side effects likely to be attributable to aripiprazole (APZ); 2) participated
      in the blinded portion of the clinical trial for a minimum of 4 weeks.

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item o the YMRS is given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher being more severe mania.</description>

    <description>The CDRS-R is a rating scale used to assess severity of depression and change in depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. The CDRS-R is a 17-item scale administered by clinician's in interviews with a child/parent(s). Each item is scored on a range of 1-5 or 1-7 with a total possible score of 17-113. A score greater or equal to 40 is indicative of depression and a score less than or equal to 28 is typically means few or no depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-Severity) is a physician-administered assessment designed to track progress over time on a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The CGI-Severity or CGI-S consists of one question about the extent of a patient's mental illness at the time of the assessment. Using a 7-point rating scale, clinicians rate the severity of mental illness based on an average of observed and reported symptoms, behavior and function during the past 7 days. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>

    <description>The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale IV or (ARS-IV) is a clinician-scored rating scale used to track the frequency of ADHD symptoms during the previous 1-week period. The ARS-IV contains 18 questions--(9 focused on inattention, and 9 on hyperactivity-impulsivity.) Questions are answered in a way that best describes ADHD symptom frequency--Never or Rarely=0, Sometimes=1, Often=2, or Very Often=3. The clinician adds up the responses for a total score. Higher total scores indicate a greater degree of symptoms being present. As a result, the minimum score is 0, and the maximum score is 54.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>After screening and baseline assessments study participants were assigned to aripiprazole or placebo. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 0.1mg/kg/d. The dose could be increased by approximately 0.05 mg/kg/d at each study visit if patient experienced residual symptomology with no intolerable side effect to maximum dose 15mg/d.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items and is based on the patient’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item o the YMRS is given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher being more severe mania.</description>

          <title>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</title>
          <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items and is based on the patient’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item o the YMRS is given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher being more severe mania.</description>

A score greater or equal to 40 is indicative of depression and a score less than or equal to 28 is typically means few or no depressive symptoms.</description>

        <title>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</title>
        <description>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) is a scale that clinicians use in order to rate the general emotional and behavioral functioning of children and adolescents under age 18. The scoring range is either 1 to 100. Youth with higher scores indicate better functioning with 91-100 &quot;Doing very well&quot; to 1-10 Extremely impaired.
The score should be calculated separate from diagnosis, treatment or prognosis.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-Severity)</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-Severity) is a physician-administered assessment designed to track progress over time on a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The CGI-Severity or CGI-S consists of one question about the extent of a patient's mental illness at the time of the assessment. Using a 7-point rating scale, clinicians rate the severity of mental illness based on an average of observed and reported symptoms, behavior and function during the past 7 days. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>

The ARS-IV contains 18 questions--(9 focused on inattention, and 9 on hyperactivity-impulsivity.) Questions are answered in a way that best describes ADHD symptom frequency--Never or Rarely=0, Sometimes=1, Often=2, or Very Often=3. The clinician adds up the responses for a total score. Higher total scores indicate a greater degree of symptoms being present. As a result, the minimum score is 0, and the maximum score is 54.</description>

          <title>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale IV or (ARS-IV)</title>
          <description>The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale IV or (ARS-IV) is a clinician-scored rating scale used to track the frequency of ADHD symptoms during the previous 1-week period. The ARS-IV contains 18 questions--(9 focused on inattention, and 9 on hyperactivity-impulsivity.) Questions are answered in a way that best describes ADHD symptom frequency--Never or Rarely=0, Sometimes=1, Often=2, or Very Often=3. The clinician adds up the responses for a total score. Higher total scores indicate a greater degree of symptoms being present. As a result, the minimum score is 0, and the maximum score is 54.</description>
          <population>There were 30 patients in the Abilify group and 29 patients in the placebo group who completed at least 1 week of the study as per the participant flow. As a result of missing data, data on 28 of 30 in the Abilify group and 28 of 29 in the placebo group were available and included in the analysis.</population>
