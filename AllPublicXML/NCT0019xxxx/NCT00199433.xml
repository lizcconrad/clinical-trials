    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 40
      mg per day of istradefylline (KW6002) as monotherapy in patients with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease which results in deterioration of motor function
      and is the result of dopamine depletion in specific brain structures. Current therapeutic
      approaches include dopamine replacement and the use of dopamine receptor agonist drugs. These
      therapies are effective but may be associated with unwanted complications like wearing off
      phenomena and involuntary abnormal movements (dyskinesia). Istradefylline may provide a
      nondopaminergic approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

      This study will compare the efficacy of 40 mg per day of istradefylline in improving the
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease with placebo.
