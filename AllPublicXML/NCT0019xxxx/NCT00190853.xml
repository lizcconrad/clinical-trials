  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the effects of duloxetine in women with urodynamically proved stress urinary incontinence on the within-group change in vesical Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) from baseline to endpoint.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the within-group endpoint/baseline ratios of Root Mean Square Voltage and Mean Rectified Voltage from the rhabdosphincter electromyogram (EMG) at rest and with coughing, and the ratio of cough/rest ratios from baseline to endpoint.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the within-group changes in VLPP and ratios of EMG variables from baseline to 6 months and from 4 weeks to 6 months.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To describe the percent change in incontinence episode frequency (IEF) from baseline to post-baseline and define two groups, responders and non-responders, based on threshold value of &lt; 50% IEF reduction values.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the changes in VLPP and EMG ratios from baseline to 4 weeks and from baseline to 6 months in responder and non responders</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of duloxetine for up to 28 weeks in subjects diagnosed with urodynamic stress incontinence.Based on treatment-emergent adverse events, discontinuation rates, vital signs, and laboratory analyses</measure>
