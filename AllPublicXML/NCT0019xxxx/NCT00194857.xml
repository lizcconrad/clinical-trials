  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test two separate strategies for treatment of anemia (low
      hemoglobin) and neutropenia (low white blood cells) in HIV/HCV coinfected patients who are
      being treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-labeled trial in subjects co-infected with hepatitis
      C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who are na√Øve to anti-HCV therapy.
      Subjects will receive PEG interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) 1.5 mcg/kg/week administered once
      weekly plus ribavirin (RBV) 13 + 2 mg/kg/day. The goal of this study is to evaluate two
      different treatment options for anemia and neutropenia associated with the initiation of
      pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This will result in completion of therapy, and possibly a
      better viral sustained response.
