  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Five subjects will be admitted to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). The next day
      they will eat a light breakfast, fast for 90 minutes, ingest ETEC strain H10407, and fast for
      90 more minutes. After this challenge they will be monitored closely , and all stools will be
      collected, graded and weighed. On Day 5, or sooner if indicated, they will begin antibiotics
      to eradicate the challenge strain. They will be scheduled for discharge on Day 7 but may
      leave a few days earlier if early antibiotic treatment is given.

      Hypothesis:

      A challenge dose of 10(9) colony forming unit (CFU) of ETEC strain H10407, will cause
      diarrhea in at least 60% of subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for validation H10407 in the challenge study proposed at Johns Hopkins
      University is that this initial challenge study will support additional challenge studies
      planned for the future. In these future studies, a bovine milk immunoglobulin containing high
      levels of antibodies specific for colonization factor antigen (CFA/I) or CFA/I-derived
      colonization factor will be investigated as a potential oral prophylaxis to neutralize
      subsequent challenge against CFA/I-expressing H10407 in the clinical setting. The goal here
      is therefore to validate a challenge dose of 1x109 h10407 organisms in the hands of the Johns
      Hopkins investigative team and to then use this dose in the future prophylaxis/challenge
      studies. Challenge doses equal to or comparable to the 1x109 dose proposed for the Johns
      Hopkins University (JHU) study have been used in 6 of the 9 challenge studies that have been
      done with the H10407 strain. The subsequent challenge studies using H10407 will be registered
      as part of other protocols.
