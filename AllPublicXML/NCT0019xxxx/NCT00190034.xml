      The purpose of this study is to determine whether N-acetylcysteine is effective in the
      prophylaxis of post-cardiopulmonary bypass acute renal impairment.

      BACKGROUND Reactive oxygen species have been shown to cause contrast-induced nephrotoxicity
      (CIN). According to previous studies, the N-acetylcysteine has been proved to be advantageous
      in the avoidance of CIN. We seek to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine
      in limiting the nephrotoxicity after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

      METHODS We will prospectively study 60 patients who will receive a cardiovascular surgery
      with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either
      N-acetylcysteine (600 mg orally twice daily for 4 doses) with 0.45% saline intravenously,
      before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, or placebo with 0.45% saline. Serum creatinine and
      blood urea nitrogen will be measured before, 48 h and 5 days after the operation procedure.

      Expected results Prophylactic oral administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, along
      with hydration, will significantly reduce the acute renal damage induced by CPB in patients
      with chronic renal insufficiency that need cardiovascular procedures.
