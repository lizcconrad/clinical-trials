  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the safety and acceptability of a novel &quot;two dose&quot; regimen of
      methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The regimen is an attempt to create a middle ground between the 2 commonly used regimens -
      &quot;single dose&quot; and &quot;multi dose&quot;. The &quot;multi dose&quot; regimen is more effective, but the &quot;single
      dose&quot; regimen is more convenient for patients and has fewer side effects.
