  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Adult Antiretroviral Treatment and Resistance Study,&quot; hereafter referred to as &quot;The
      Tshepo Study,&quot; is the first large-scale research study of antiretroviral therapy to treat
      AIDS and HIV infection in Botswana. The Tshepo Study is an open-label, randomized study
      comparing: (1) the rate of development and specific types of drug resistance mutations with
      various antiretroviral combination therapies to HIV-1C, the subtype of HIV found in southern
      Africa, and (2) the short and long-term effectiveness of two operational modifications of
      Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) medication adherence strategies for antiretroviral therapy.
      Specifically, treatment follow-up via the Standard of Care, the national standard of care as
      it evolves in Botswana, with intensive clinic-based follow up including regular adherence
      education sessions, will be compared to Community-Based Directly Observed Therapy (Com-DOT).
      Com-DOT involves the SOC with added community or family-based DOT. This Com-DOT component
      would involve a trained, community or family-based Medication Partner (&quot;mopati&quot;) who observes
      the patient take his or medications daily.
