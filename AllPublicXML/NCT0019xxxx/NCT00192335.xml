             egg products;

          -  History of hypersensitivity to gentamicin;

          -  Any known immunosuppressive condition or immune deficiency disease (including HIV
             infection), or ongoing receipt of any immunosuppressive therapy;

          -  Household contact who is immunocompromised (participants should also avoid close
             contact with other immunocompromised individuals for at least 21 days);

          -  History of chronic underlying medical conditions such as chronic disorders of the
             cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes),
             renal dysfunction, or hemoglobinopathies;

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome;

          -  History of asthma or reactive airways disease;

          -  For children age 5 through 8 years, receipt of prior influenza vaccination;

          -  Acute febrile (&gt;100.0°F oral) and/or respiratory illness within the 72 hours prior to

             willing to agree to acceptable birth control for 90 days after enrolling into the
             study (for those biologically capable, a urine pregnancy test must be performed on the
             day of vaccination with a negative result);
