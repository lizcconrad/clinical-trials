  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to determine vaccine efficacy against severe rotavirus
      (RV) gastroenteritis (GE) during the period starting from 2 weeks after Dose 2 until two
      years of age and to determine the safety of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine with respect to
      definite intussusception (IS) within 31 days (Day 0-Day 30) after each HRV vaccine dose.

      The study has two groups: Group HRV and Group Placebo. Two oral doses administered to healthy
      infants who are 6-12 weeks of age in Hongkong and Taiwan or 11-17 weeks of age in Singapore,
      according to a 0, 1 to 2-month schedule. Routine vaccinations are given concomitantly with
      the study vaccines at 2 or 3 and 4 months of age according to each local country regulation.
      Whenever OPV is used, a minimum 2-week interval should be observed between HRV vaccine and
      OPV doses.
