  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to show that a prandial insulin regimen, consisting of
      premeal insulin lispro &quot;mid mixture&quot; (or a combined regimen of insulin lispro &quot;mid mixture&quot;
      and insulin lispro &quot;low mixture&quot;) plus metformin will result in significantly better overall
      glycemic control (lower HbA1c) at endpoint than once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin.
      Insulin lispro &quot;mid mixture&quot; consists of 50% insulin lispro and 50% NPL. Insulin lispro &quot;low
      mixture&quot; consists of 25% insulin lispro and 75% NPL.

      In a substudy of approximately 60 patients, additional data will be collected on markers
      associated with risk of atherosclerosis or cardiovascular disease in the context of a
      controlled, outpatient, high-fat test meal.

             or second-generation sulfonylurea (for example, glibenclamide, glyburide, glipizide,
             gliclazide, glimepiride) alone or in combination with one or two insulin injections
             per day for at least 3 months immediately prior to entering the study. Patients using
             more than 2 insulin injections per day or subcutaneous insulin infusion prior to the
             study will not be eligible to participate.

          -  Have a hemoglobin A1c between 6.5% and 11%, inclusive, according to the central
             laboratory at Visit 1.

          -  Have known metabolic or lactic acidosis.

          -  Have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal dialysis or
             have serum creatinine greater than or equal to 135 micromol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for males

          -  Have cardiac disease with functional status that is Class III or IV

          -  Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic hepatitis,
             or alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than three times the upper limit of the
