      The purpose of this study is to find out the safety and feasibility of weekly topotecan
      consolidation therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.

      Patients with Stage IIIC and IV optimally-debulked ovarian cancer will be treated with 6
      cycles (every 3 weeks) of carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Patients who
      demonstrate a complete clinical response to this regimen will then be treated with topotecan
      consolidation (4 mg/m2 weekly x 8 weeks for one cycle followed by a break in the 9th week)
      for a maximum of 3 cycles. Primary endpoints will be toxicity and the determination of the
      appropriate dose, schedule, and duration of topotecan for further consolidation trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histopathologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.

          -  Patients must have completed front-line chemotherapy and be clinically NED (CA 125
             &lt;35, negative CT scan, negative physical exam).

          -  Patients may have a second look laparoscopy, however, there must be no gross disease
             present (microscopic disease or pathologically negative).

          -  Patients must not have had other myelosuppressive therapy within four weeks of
             initiating topotecan therapy.

          -  Topotecan treatment must begin within 10 weeks following last cycle of initial
             chemotherapy.

          -  Patients may have had only one prior chemotherapy regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a concomitant malignancy other than squamous cell or basal cell skin
             cancer.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
