  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on results from earlier clinical trials, Pemetrexed may have antitumor activity as a
      first-line agent in the treatment of mesothelioma. Given this, it is hypothesized that
      Pemetrexed may be active in second-line mesothelioma in which the standard treatment is best
      supportive care. This study will compare survival of previously treated patients with
      malignant pleural mesothelioma who receive Pemetrexed plus best supportive care to the
      survival of similar patients who receive best supportive care alone.
