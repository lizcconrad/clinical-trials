  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study was that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) focused on
      hyperfunctional cerebral areas should be more effective in treating depressive symptoms than
      stimulations not taking into account the functional specificity of the patient. The goal was
      to compare the effects of &quot;guided&quot; TMS, using neuroimaging to guide TMS on dysfunctional
      cortical regions individually detected by neuroimaging, with &quot;standard TMS&quot;, as used in most
      studies, over the left prefrontal cortex, and with sham TMS, in patients with resistant
      depression.

      The objectives of the study were :

        -  To localize the site of lowest frontal activity in each patient with resistant
           depression, using PET to measure regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose
           (rCMRGlu).

        -  To demonstrate that high-frequency TMS (10Hz) guided on that site is more effective than
           standard or sham TMS, in resistant depressed patients, using a doubled blind controlled
           procedure.

        -  To assess the effects of TMS on regional cerebral metabolism using rCMRGlu PET after 10
           sessions of TMS treatments.

      Depressed patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, aged between 18 and
      55, have been included. They met criteria for depression resistant to antidepressant drugs
      They were randomised in 3 groups: guided prefrontal TMS, standard left prefrontal and sham
      left prefrontal TMS.

      rTMS was administered daily on working days, for two weeks. Ten stimuli per second (10Hz)
      were applied in 20 courses so that patients received 1600 stimuli per day. Guided TMS was on
      a prefrontal target corresponding to the highest statistically significant hyperfunctional
      cluster determined with rCMRGlu PET. Standard stimulation was left pre-frontal, 5 cm anterior
      to the optimal stimulation point of the abductor pollices brevis. Stimulation strength was
      chosen at 90% relative to motor threshold. Sham rTMS used a procedure identical to the real
      standard treatment, but using a sham coil.
