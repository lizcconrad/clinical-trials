  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on available data, the concept of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be promising for
      patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The exploration of new drugs and
      regimens are warranted. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical response
      rate of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with operable
      non-small cell lung cancer stage IB, IIA-B, IIIA.
