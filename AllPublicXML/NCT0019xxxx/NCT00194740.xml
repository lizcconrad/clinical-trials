      The two drugs used to treat metastatic breast cancer in this study may perform better when
      used together than when used separately. The use of another drug that prevents the most
      common side effect of the two-drug combination permits the delivery of both agents at closer
      to the &quot;full&quot; dose for either when used alone. We hypothesize that the two-drug combination
      used with G-CSF support will be more effective and less toxic than other standard regimens
      for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

      Preclinical data suggest that there may be synergy between vinorelbine and paclitaxel when
      the two drugs are used in combination such that the effect of the two together may be better
      than either alone. Clinical data suggest that the use of concurrent G-CSF with paclitaxel and
      vinorelbine permits the delivery of both agents at approximately 70% of the &quot;full&quot; dose for
      either, used alone without G-CSF support, with myelosuppression as the usual dose-limiting
      toxicity and no unusual or unexpected complications. Encouragingly, 8/20 (40%) patients had
      objective responses, with three complete remissions (15%) in this program of third-line
      therapy. Therefore, we now propose to combine docetaxel at about 70% of &quot;full&quot; dose with
      vinorelbine at 27.5 mg/m2, the &quot;phase II&quot; dose defined in the previous trial. Docetaxel will
      be given on day 1 followed by vinorelbine on days 8 and 15, with G-CSF to be administered on
      all days except that of docetaxel administration. The cycle is to be repeated every three
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have stage IV, microscopically-confirmed carcinoma of the breast with
             histologic slides and/or blocks available for review.

          -  Patients must have relapse or progression while receiving, or within 12 months of
             having received, anthracycline-containing (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone) regimen as
             either adjuvant treatment or therapy for advanced breast cancer. Prior Taxol by 3- or
             24-hour infusion is permitted. Patients who have received a maximum dose of
             anthracycline (greater than 450 mg/m2) are also eligible.

          -  Patients must have measurable (bidimensionally) or evaluable disease.

          -  Patients must be 18 or more years of age.
