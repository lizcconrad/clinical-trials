          -  Evidence of any systemic disease on physical examination

          -  Evidence of infection with hepatitis A, B, or C virus or HIV-1

          -  At screening (must be within 7 days before study dose administration) any of the
             following: CBC: Hgb &lt; 12.0 gm/dL; WBC &lt; 4,000/mm3; platelet count &lt; 120,000/mm3 (or
             laboratory normal values); AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal; other
             abnormal laboratory values in the screening panel which in the opinion of the
             principal investigator are judged to be clinically significant.

          -  Nursing mother

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 2 years
