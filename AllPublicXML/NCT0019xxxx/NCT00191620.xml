  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine:

      How standard gemcitabine plus cisplatin compares to fixed dose rate of gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

      The safety of standard gemcitabine plus cisplatin and any side effects that might be
      associated with it as compared to a fixed dose rate of gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
