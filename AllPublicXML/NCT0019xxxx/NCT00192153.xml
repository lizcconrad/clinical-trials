  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate immune responses measuring antibodies in
      serum and secretions and cellular immune responses generated by CAIV-T vaccine in healthy
      adults aged 18 years and older as a means to develop assays for application in investigating
      potential immunological correlates of protection and/or establishing assays to measure
      vaccine take.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years or &gt; 60 years.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who had a negative urine pregnancy test
             result prior to study vaccination. Females who were surgically sterile or
             post-menopausal did not require pregnancy testing.

          -  Adults who were determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical
             judgment eligible for this study. Subjects with stable pre-existing disease, defined
             as disease not requiring change in therapy or hospitalization within 12 weeks before
             receipt of study vaccination, will be eligible.

          -  Subjects who provided written informed consent after the nature of the study was
             explained.

          -  Subjects who were available for the duration of the study (from enrollment to study
             completion).

          -  Subjects who could be reached by study staff for the post-vaccination contact [via
             telephone, clinic or home visit].

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For subjects &gt; 60 years of age only:

          -  Subjects who resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility or other institution
             receiving skilled or semi-skilled nursing care. An ambulatory subject who resided in a
             retirement home or village was eligible for participation.

          -  Subjects with evidence of dementia or other severe cognitive impairment based on Mini
             Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Note: Prior to study vaccination, all subjects
             &gt;60 years of age must have completed a MMSE.

        For all study subjects:

          -  Subjects who were perceived to be unavailable or difficult to contact for evaluation
             of study visits during the study period.

          -  Subjects with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids; or cytotoxic agents.

          -  Subjects who resided in the same household as an immunosuppressed or immunocompromised
             individual.

          -  Subjects with a documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein or any
             other component of the study vaccine, placebo or TIV.

          -  Subjects who had a current wheezing episode that was considered a change from the
             subjectâ€™s usual clinical state.
