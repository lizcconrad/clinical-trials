  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine 1) the safety of pemetrexed and any side effects
      that might be associated with it 2) whether pemetrexed can help patients with small cell lung
      cancer live longer 3) whether pemetrexed can make tumors smaller or disappear and for how
      long and 4) to see if patients feel better while taking pemetrexed
