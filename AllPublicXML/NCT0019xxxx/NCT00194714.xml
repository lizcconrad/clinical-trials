      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy and to see how well it
      works in treating patients with stage IV major histocompatibility complex, class I, A2
      antigen (HLA-A2) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast or
      ovarian cancer who are receiving trastuzumab. Giving booster vaccines made from HER2 peptides
      may help increase HER2 specific immunity and immune memory cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of administering a HER2 cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) peptide-based
      vaccine (HER-2/neu peptide vaccine) to stage IV breast and ovarian cancer patients receiving
      maintenance trastuzumab.

      II. To quantify and characterize antigen specific T cell subsets specific to HER2 in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients after vaccination with a HER2 CTL
      peptide-based vaccine while receiving maintenance trastuzumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients who complete a vaccination series with a
      HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine while receiving maintenance trastuzumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally (ID) once per month for 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then yearly for up to 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have either stage IV breast or ovarian cancer in remission or with
             stable disease on trastuzumab monotherapy

          -  HER2 overexpression by immunohistocytochemistry (IHC) of 2+ or 3+, in the primary
             tumor or metastasis; if overexpression is 2+ by IHC, then patients must have HER2 gene
             amplification documented by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

          -  Subjects must be HLA-A2 positive

          -  Eligible subjects must have completed appropriate treatment for their primary disease
             and be off cytotoxic chemotherapy and any immunosuppressive agents such as systemic
             steroids for at least 30 days prior to enrollment; patients should continue
             trastuzumab monotherapy throughout the course of this protocol; concurrent hormonal
             and biphosphonate therapies are allowed

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
