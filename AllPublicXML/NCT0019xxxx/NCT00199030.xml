      This study tests the effectivity and tolerability of treatment with alemtuzumab (MabCampath)
      in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or
      T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. In Arm A, patients with refractory relapse receive a 2 week
      treatment with MabCampath followed by remission evaluation. In case of insufficient response,
      treatment with cladribine is added. In Arm B, patients with molecular relapse (minimal
      residual disease) receive a 4 week treatment with MabCampath followed by remission
      evaluation. In both arms, treatment is continued in case of response for up to two months.
