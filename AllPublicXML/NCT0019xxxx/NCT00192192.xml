      To perform a variety of assays on blood, serum, nasal wash samples and cells obtained from
      healthy adult subjects for the purposes of developing assays for application in the further
      investigation of immune responses generated by influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A
      and B, live, cold-adapted (liquid CAIV-T; Wyeth Lederle Vaccines, Marietta, PA).

          -  who are determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical judgement to
             be eligible for this study. Subjects with stable pre-existing disease, defined as
             disease not requiring change in therapy or hospitalization within 12 weeks before
             receipt of study vaccination will be eligible.

          -  who have provided written informed consent after the nature of the study has been
             explained;

          -  who, will be available for two month duration of the trial (from enrollment to study
             completion);

          -  who can be reached by study staff for the post-vaccination contact [telephone, clinic
             or home visit]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  who are perceived to be unavailable or difficult to contact for evaluation or study
             visits during the study period

          -  with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids; or cytotoxic agents;

          -  who received any blood products, including immunoglobulin, in the period from six
             months prior to vaccination through to the conclusion of the study;

          -  have an immunosuppressed or an immunocompromised individual living in the same
             household;

          -  with a documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein or any other
             component of the study vaccine or placebo;

          -  who were administered any live virus vaccine within one month prior to enrollment;

          -  for whom there is intent to administer any other investigational vaccine or agent from
             one month prior to enrollment through to the conclusion of the study;

          -  who, received a dose of influenza treatment (commercial or investigational) one month
             prior to enrollment. The prophylactic use of influenza antivirals is not permitted.

          -  who receive any influenza vaccine in the 6 months prior to enrollment, or a non-study
             influenza vaccine since enrollment;

          -  with any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere
             with interpretation of the study results; Note: A pregnant household member is not
