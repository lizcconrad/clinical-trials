  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether the study vaccine and adjuvants (drugs that are
      used to help improve immune responses) have an acceptable safety profile in treating
      individuals with HIV.

      A second purpose of this study is to understand how the immune system responds to the study
      vaccine and adjuvants.
