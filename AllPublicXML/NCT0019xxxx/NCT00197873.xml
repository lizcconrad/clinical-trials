  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy may cause diarrhoea, which may be associated with treatment delay and
      infections. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether oral supplementation with
      lactobacilli will alleviate chemotherapy related diarrhoea. Patients diagnosed with advanced
      colorectal cancer and who will receive chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to receive
      either lactobacilli or placebo during chemotherapy. The study is a prospective, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure is frequency
      of moderate/severe diarrhoea. The study will also address safety and tolerability of
      chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy, and serum growth factor levels.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. Patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer with overt distant metastases and
      who will receive chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, given
      as 3-weekly cycles, will be randomly assigned to receive either lactobacilli (GefilusR) or
      placebo during the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy (for 9 weeks). Following this, the groups
      will be crossed over and those study participants who were allocated to lactobacilli will
      receive placebo for 9 weeks, and vice versa. Lactobacilli and placebo are administered twice
      daily. The total daily dose of lactobacilli is 20 billion CFU. The primary outcome measure is
      frequency of moderate/severe diarrhoea (grade 2-4). Adverse effects (including the frequency
      of diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating, constipation, and nausea) will be longitudinally
      monitored based on a patient diary and study visits. The study will also address safety and
      tolerability of chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival,
      resectability of liver metastases, and serum growth factor levels. A total of 84 patients are
      planned to be entered.
