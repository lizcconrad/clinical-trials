    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin used as neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (2 or 3 cycles) in participants with operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      is to look at various genes present in participants' blood and tumor tissue to see if there
      is any link between the levels or changes in the genes and how participants with lung cancer
      respond to pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment.

    <measure>High/Low Expression of Selected Molecular Markers in Tumor Tissues and Hypermethylated Genes in Peripheral Blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 2, and surgery (4-8 weeks after last dose of pemetrexed)</time_frame>
    <description>Molecular markers assessed by immunohistochemistry: thymidylate synthase, glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and by polymerase chain reaction: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), reduced folate carrier, alpha folate receptor, Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1 (ERCC1), folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH). Hypermethylated genes assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Due to small sample size, tumor-tissue analyses were not done.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Tumor Response (Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment start to disease progression or surgery (4-8 weeks after last dose of pemetrexed)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response to treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD)=small changes that do not meet above criteria. Response rate was estimated as the total number of CR or PR, divided by the total number of participants treated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to disease progression (up to 44.4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was defined as the time from complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to disease progression. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Free Survival (DFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment start to disease progression or death from any cause (up to 45.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DFS was the time from date of first dose to first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. If a participant was not known to have died or have PD, DFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment start to death from any cause (up to 47.6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from treatment start to death from any cause. For participants who were alive, OS was censored at the last contact date.</description>

          <description>Pemetrexed was approved in April 2008 for first- and second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), other than predominantly squamous. Of the 30 participants enrolled at that time, 20 had squamous cell histology. The protocol was not amended since enrollment stopped early (October 2008) due to lack of eligible participants.</description>
