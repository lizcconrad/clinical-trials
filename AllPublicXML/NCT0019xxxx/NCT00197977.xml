      patients' expectations of long-term outcomes of total knee arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      The first goal of this study is to develop an educational intervention to address patients'
      expectations of long-term outcomes of total knee arthroplasty. The intervention will be
      structured according to the expectations listed in the Hospital for Special Surgery Total
      Knee Replacement Expectations Survey. The second goal is to test the intervention in a
      randomized trial. An additional goal is to compare patients' self-reported knee symptoms with
      radiographic findings.
