  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between trauma, the immune
      system, biochemical changes in the first 24 h and subsequent complications and mortality
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immune system plays a role in the development of complications after severe trauma, but
      we do not know how. Equally, biochemical changes measured in the blood after trauma (eg.
      bloodglucose, GC-globulin, coagulation parameters etc.) may predict the prognosis and the
      degree of complcations. Two significant complications are infection and organ failure, which
      may prolong hospitalisation and increase mortality.

      In the study we collected samples from blood and body surfaces to determine changes in
      cytokines, biochemistry, bacterial flora, and subsequent complications. We compare the
      changes in between groups of the cohort.
