  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is an important cause of death and serious illness among Mozambican children.
      Although the risk of malaria can be reduced by drugs and by impregnated bed nets, it would be
      helpful if children could be protected against malaria by a vaccine.

      GSK Biologicals is developing in partnership with Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH a
      candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02 for the routine immunization of infants and children
      living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection against malaria disease
      due to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and also would provide protection against infection
      with hepatitis B virus. Previous studies have shown the candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02
      to be safe when administered in adults and children aged 1-11 years. However, to assess if
      this vaccine could provide protection against malaria in children, this study has been
      undertaken.

      In this study, the participating children will either receive either 3 doses of the new
      malaria vaccine or the control vaccine which has been selected because of its benefit to the
      children in preventing important childhood diseases. The control vaccines include the
      following:

        -  If the child is of 24 months or older, he/she may receive 3 doses of a vaccine, called
           Engerix-B™, which protects against hepatitis B.

        -  If the child is less than 24 months, he/she may receive: two doses of a vaccine called
           Prevnar® and one dose of a vaccine called Hiberix™. Prevnar® prevents pneumonia and
           meningitis caused by some Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. Hiberix™ prevents severe
           infections such as pneumonia and meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b
           bacteria (Hib). All children will be monitored for the development of malaria disease
           over an 18-month period extending from the third vaccination. All participants will also
           be monitored for vaccine safety from first vaccination to study close.
