  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the liquid formulation of CAIVT
      against culture confirmed influenza illness in healthy children aged at least 6 months and
      less than 36 months, attending day care centers in Europe. In addition, the trial provides
      the opportunity to investigate the effect of CAIV-T on acute otitis media, on healthcare
      resource utilization and economic resources.
