  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of two nucleoside analogues and one protease inhibitor is a highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infected adults. In those with an undetectable viral
      load, a once daily combination of FTC, ddI, efavirenz would be easier to take, with less side
      effects and the same efficacy. The aim of the study was to evaluate if the once daily
      combination presents the same efficacy than the HAART therapy with less side effects and a
      better adherence.

    <textblock>
      The combination of two nucleoside analogues and one protease inhibitor is a highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infected adults, but side effects an the great number
      of pills induces less adherence to the therapy. Once daily combination with a lower number of
      pills could be more easy to take, with a greater adherence, less side effects, and the same
      efficacy. 355 patients are recruited in the study, randomized in two treatment groups:
      maintenance of the HAART therapy versus changing for a once daily combination of FTC, ddI,
      efavirenz, during 48 weeks. The primary end-point is the viral success maintained until 48
      weeks. Secondary end-point is the safety and adherence.

      The trial is prolonged for a total of 48 weeks.
