      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy of escitalopram (30 mg/day) in two parallel groups (randomization
      ratio, escitalopram 2/placebo 1).

      Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of oral escitalopram at the dosage of 30 mg/day
      for 16 weeks on the 6-minute walking test in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet all the criteria listed below will be considered for study inclusion:

          -  Male or female older than 18 years of age

          -  Meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for pulmonary hypertension (mean
             pulmonary arterial pressure [PAP] &gt; 25 mmHg at rest and pulmonary capillary wedge
             pressure &lt; 15 mmHg during right heart catheterization):

               -  primary pulmonary hypertension (sporadic or familial), or

               -  pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases, or

               -  pulmonary hypertension associated with HIV infection, or

               -  pulmonary hypertension associated with use of appetite suppressants or other
                  toxic compounds, or

               -  pulmonary hypertension associated with shunting through a congenital heart defect
                  surgically treated

          -  Class II or III in the NYHA classification scheme

          -  With a 6-minute walking test distance between 40% and 80% of theoretical values
             (approximately 50 and 480 m)

          -  On conventional treatment, with no change in this treatment during the last month
             preceding the study. Conventional treatment includes calcium antagonists or beraprost.

          -  Subject who consents to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following clinical features will not be included in the study:

          -  Pulmonary hypertension related to aortic or mitral valve disease, or extrinsic
             pulmonary vein compression

          -  Pulmonary hypertension related to hypoxia from respiratory disease with a total lung
             capacity &lt; 70% or Tiffeneau index &lt; 60% upon testing within the last 6 months (chronic
             obstructive lung disease, interstitial disease, sleep apnea syndrome, alveolar
             hypoventilation, chronic exposure to high altitudes, neonatal lung disease, or
             alveolar capillary dysplasia)

          -  Pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension

          -  Pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic thrombosis and/or embolism (occlusion of
             the proximal or distal pulmonary arteries by thrombosis)

          -  In the 6-minute walking test, inability to walk for 6 minutes, for any reason, or
             walking distance of less than 50 m

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, women of childbearing potential (if needed, effective
             contraception will be prescribed)

          -  History of hypersensitivity to citalopram or to medications structurally related to
             citalopram

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug within the 3 months preceding study
             inclusion

          -  Cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological or endocrine disease that is clinically
             significant, or any other significant disease that may interfere with the study
             protocol or with the interpretation of study findings

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Liver failure (except abnormalities related to the right ventricular failure)

          -  Kidney failure

          -  Mental status preventing the patient from understanding the nature, objectives, and
             possible consequences of the study

          -  Non stabilized psychiatric disorders

          -  Subject unable to comply with protocol-related constraints (e.g., uncooperative,
             unable to attend follow-up visits, and probably unable to complete the study).
