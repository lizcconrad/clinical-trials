      This phase I study will evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of weekly bortezomib in the
      treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple Myeloma and determine whether a twice-weekly
      schedule of bortezomib is effective in producing responses in patients with stable disease or
      progression after weekly bortezomib
