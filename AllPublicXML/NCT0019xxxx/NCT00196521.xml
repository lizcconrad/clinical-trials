    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence affects nearly 30 million women worldwide and the main goal of
      surgical treatment is to stop urinary incontinence (urinary leakage) that occurs with
      physical activity, coughing, sneezing, etc.Patients in the study will have an operation to
      improve urinary incontinence symptoms. This will involve inserting a mesh sling to help
      support the urethra (tube leading into your bladder). During the operation, the study doctor
      will use tension-free vaginal obturator system. The study will include women diagnosed with
      Stress Urinary Incontinence who have completed their families.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has objective demonstrable signs of stress urinary incontinence (SUI),
             including patients with ISD. Objective testing includes: standing stress test,
             urodynamics evaluation, or pad test.

          -  Patient is age 18 or older.

          -  Patient had a hysterectomy, tubal ligation or is otherwise incapable of pregnancy, or
             had a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry and has decided to cease
             childbearing.

          -  Patient agrees to participate in the study, including completion of all study-related
             procedures and evaluations, and documents this agreement by signing the
             IRB/EC-approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has an associated or suspected neurological disease.

          -  Patient is on anti-coagulation therapy.

          -  Patient has received an investigational drug or device in the past 60 days.

        For patients having URP measurements at selected sites:

          -  Patient has an active lesion or present injury to perineum or urethra.Patient has a
             urethral obstruction.

          -  Patient has an unreduced cystocele &gt; Stage 1. (Reduction of prolapse prior to URP
             testing is required.) Reduction of Cystocele (if applicable). Patients should be
             seated in a semi-fowler's position with head of bed at 40-60 degrees.

        Carefully place a half of a speculum into the vagina, reducing prolapse to less than stage
        1. Be careful not to over extend or elongate the vaginal length.

        The half of a speculum must be placed with pressure emphasis on the posterior and apical
        areas. Anterior wall pressure or urethral pressure must be avoided at all times.

          -  The subject has active infection upon urine dipstick analysis, defined as ≥+1
             leukocytes or ≥+1 nitrates (Must reschedule appointment after UTI resolves.)
