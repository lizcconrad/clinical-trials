  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design:

      Prospective, open phase II trial

      Treatment:

      Capecitabine 2000 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 until progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      patient's request or withdrawal from study

      Primary objective

      To determine the time to disease progression in patients with HER2 negative metastatic breast
      cancer after 1st line monochemotherapy with capecitabine

      Secondary objectives

        1. To determine the objective response rate

        2. To determine the duration of response

        3. To determine the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks

        4. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of capecitabine

        5. To assess quality of life within 1 year after start of capecitabine treatment

        6. To determine overall survival

        7. To determine the objective response rate in male patients

        8. To evaluate QoL the modified Brunner Score (Appendix 7 )

      Tertiary objective

      To determine the DPD and Proteomics in serum

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent prior to beginning specific protocol procedures, including
             expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be obtained
             and documented according to the local regulatory requirements.

          2. Histologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast.

          3. Negative for HER2-overexpression of the primary and/or metastatic tumour tissue
             detected by immunohistochemistry (DAKO 0-2) or genamplification detected by FISH.

          4. Locally advanced or metastatic stage of disease not suitable for surgery or
             radiotherapy alone.

          5. The following previous systemic treatment are eligible:

             adjuvant chemotherapy (except if capecitabine was included) adjuvant endocrine therapy

             WHO criteria (see Appendix 5).

          7. At least 4 weeks since radiotherapy, with full recovery. The measurable disease must
             be completely outside the radiation portal or there must be pathologic proof of
             progressive disease.

          7. Patients with indication for polychemotherapy.

          8. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical
             trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry.

          9. Treatment with sorivudine or derivates e.g. brivudin.

         10. Pregnant or nursing women.
