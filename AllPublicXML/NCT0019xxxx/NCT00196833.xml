      Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer during their pregnancy may be registered in this
      trial.

      Data is collected on the foetal outcome 4 weeks after delivery, maternal outcome of pregnancy
      as well as the breast cancer therapy applied (treatment, response to chemotherapy, type of
      surgery), diagnostic procedures applied (palpation, US, mammogram) and the outcome of mother
      and child after 5 years of therapy.

      Breast cancer is the most common cancer malignancy in women of childbearing age after the age
      of 25 years. Since the incidence of breast cancer under the age of 40 is increasing, and
      women tend to delay pregnancy into later reproductive years, the coincidence of pregnancy and
      breast cancer is increasing. About 1 in 1,000 pregnancies is complicated by breast cancer.
      Nevertheless, little is known about the right therapy for the mother and the unborn child. We
      are therefore carrying out a trial, collecting prospective and retrospective data about
      pregnant women, with histological confirmed breast cancer. Data on the biology of the tumour
      and placenta tissues is also collected. The anonymous data is collected in a database.
