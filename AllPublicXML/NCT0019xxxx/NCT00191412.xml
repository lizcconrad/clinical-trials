        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cancer of the liver which is metastatic or locally recurrent and not
             amendable to curative therapy.

          -  Patient must have measurable disease

          -  Patient may have received prior arterial chemoembolization, completed 8 weeks prior to
             study enrollment, but no other previous chemotherapy

          -  Prior radiation is permitted, but must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Prior central nervous system metastases are acceptable if the patient has received
             radiation ot the brain, is not on steroids, and does not have related symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with Pemetrexed.

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy
             being present within the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous
             cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.

          -  Patients who have received radiation to more than 25% of marrow
