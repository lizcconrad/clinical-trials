  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of
      adalimumab compared with placebo (during double-blind phase) and to to evaluate the long-term
      safety and maintenance of efficacy following repeated administration of adalimumab (during
      open-label extension phase) in patients with persistently active rheumatoid arthritis who
      were receiving concurrent methotrexate therapy.

      This was a 10-year study which had an initial 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase
      followed by an open-label extension phase up to 9 years in duration. Data were analyzed for
      the double-blind phase using all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose
      of study drug through Week 52 and for all patients who received at least one dose of
      adalimumab during the 10-year study (the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-ray Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Modified total Sharp x-ray score (mTSS) is a measure of change in joint health. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were obtained at screening and Week 52. Digitized images of these were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions from 0 (no damage) to 5 and for joint space narrowing from 0 (no damage) to 4; scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). Large positive change indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression; and negative change may indicate improvement of disease.</description>

             arthritis (RA) and had at both screening and baseline visits &gt;=6 swollen joints and
             &gt;=9 tender joints, despite a minimum of 3-months treatment with methotrexate (MTX).
             (Distal interphalangeal joints [DIPs] were not to be included in joint count for
             inclusion. The screening and baseline visits could be 3 to 28 days apart for patients
             not previously receiving disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs] other than

          -  Insufficient efficacy with MTX 12.5 to 25 mg per week (10 mg per week if MTX
             intolerant).

          -  If patient on a second-line treatment (DMARD) other than MTX, he/she had to
             discontinue it for at least 28 days before the baseline visit (the washout period).

          -  Treatment with oral folic acid 1-3 mg/day or, if appropriate, up to 10 mg leucovorin
             per week.

          -  Both rheumatoid factor positivity and a C-reactive protein value &gt;=1 mg/dL, or at
             least one joint erosion on X-ray.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate
             for the study.

          -  Female subject who was pregnant or breast-feeding or considering becoming pregnant.

          -  Preceding treatment with any tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, including
             adalimumab.

          -  Prior exposure to alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide.

          -  Intra-articular, intramuscular, or intravenous administration of corticosteroids

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were enrolled at 95 sites in the United States and Canada between February 2000 and August 2001.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects who were taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than methotrexate (MTX) entered a 4- to 6-week washout period, during which previous DMARDs (except MTX) were discontinued. Subjects who were not taking DMARDs, other than MTX, entered directly into the 52-week double-blind treatment period of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-ray Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>Modified total Sharp x-ray score (mTSS) is a measure of change in joint health. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were obtained at screening and Week 52. Digitized images of these were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions from 0 (no damage) to 5 and for joint space narrowing from 0 (no damage) to 4; scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). Large positive change indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression; and negative change may indicate improvement of disease.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-ray Score at Week 24</title>
          <description>Modified total Sharp x-ray score (mTSS) is a measure of change in joint health. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were obtained at screening and Week 24. Digitized images of these were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions from 0 (no damage) to 5 and for joint space narrowing from 0 (no damage) to 4; scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). Large positive change indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression; and negative change may indicate improvement of disease.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index is a self-reported measure of disability, which assesses the patient's ability to perform the following tasks: dress and groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; maintain hygiene; and maintain daily activity. Possible responses/scores are 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), and 3 (unable to do). Negative mean changes from Baseline indicate improvement. An improvement of 0.22 in score (a -0.22 or greater reduction from Baseline score) is a minimally clinically significant change.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With at Least a 0.22 Reduction From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index at Week 520</title>
          <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index is a self-reported measure of disability, which assesses the patient's ability to perform the following tasks: dress and groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; maintain hygiene; and maintain daily activity. Possible responses/scores are 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), and 3 (unable to do). Negative mean changes from Baseline indicate improvement. An improvement of 0.22 in score (a -0.22 or greater reduction from Baseline score) is a minimally clinically significant change.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-ray Score at Week 416</title>
        <description>Modified total Sharp x-ray score (mTSS) is a measure of change in joint health. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were obtained at screening and Week 416. Digitized images of these were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions from 0 (no damage) to 5 and for joint space narrowing from 0 (no damage) to 4; scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). Large positive change indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression; and negative change may indicate improvement of disease.</description>
