      In this trial we will investigate how this three-drug regimen may be improved, both with
      respect to efficacy and toxicity, by making some modifications in the dosing and schedule in
      the treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will receive:

      Paclitaxel + Estramustine + Carboplatin

      Patients will receive weekly paclitaxel and low-dose estramustine, in combination with
      carboplatin administered either weekly r every four weeks.
