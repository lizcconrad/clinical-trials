  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although gefitinib has been combined successfully with various chemotherapeutic regimens with
      minimal increase in overall toxicity, experience with concurrent radiation therapy is
      limited. In this trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and effectiveness a novel
      combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and gefitinib.
