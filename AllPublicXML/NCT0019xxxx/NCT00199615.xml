  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guidelines and institutional practices recommended more frequent visits the two years
      following curative-intent therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).No international
      consensus is published concerning follow-up of resected NSCLC patients.Recent studies have
      outlined that positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be accurate in early detection
      of recurrences by comparison to computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study is to compare
      follow-up by conventional methods versus PET. Patients are randomly assigned to two arms. In
      the first arm, thorax CT with liver and adrenal gland sections, abdominal ultrasonography and
      nuclear bone scintigraphy are performed every 6 months after surgery for two years. In the
      second arm, PET scanning is only. For brain metastasis detection, CT is performed in the two
      arms. Recurrences are detected during scheduled or unscheduled procedure in asymptomatic
      patients. PET and CT are interpreted separately by two nuclear physicians and two
      radiologists. The direct cost of follow-up procedure is determined in the two groups. The
      calculated sample is composed of 60 patients in each arm to detect significant difference.
      The Ethics Committee of Universitary Hospital of Limoges approves the study.
