      STUDY PHASE III OBJECTIVES · To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rupatadine 10 mg and 20
      mg for the treatment of CIU symptoms over four-week treatment period in comparison with
      placebo.

      DESIGN · A multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel–group study in
      300 patients (100 patients each treatment) group.

      INDICATION · Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) ASSESSMENT Primary efficacy measure of each
      treatment will compare the frequency and severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the
      patient in terms of change in mean pruritus score (MPS) over the 4-week treatment
      period.Secondary efficacy measures include change from baseline over the 4 and 6-week
      treatment period in the mean number of wheals (MNW) score; mean total symptoms score (MTSS),
      calculated as the sum of the MPS (Mean pruritus symptoms) and the MNW (Mean number of wheals)
      scores, severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the patient in terms of change in mean
      pruritus score (MPS) over the 6-week treatment period, Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and
      Quality of life (QoL) which will be assessed by the “Dermatology Life Quality Index”
      (DLQI).Safety: ECGs baseline and final visit; clinical laboratory controls, physical
      examination, incidence of adverse events (AE).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Man or woman aged between 12 and 65

          2. Active CIU (score ³2 labeled as moderate pruritus) for at least 3 days (not
             necessarily consecutive days) in the week before inclusion with a total score of
             active CIU ³6 labeled as moderate pruritus for these 3 days

          3. Documented history of active CIU (urticaria wheals) with or without an associated
             angioedema for at least three days per week over the last 6 weeks prior to Screening
             Visit.

          4. 12 lead ECG obtained at screening within acceptable limits, moreover in absence of any
             drug effect or disease, QTc interval values (msec) after Bazzet’s correction must be
             normal (not prolonged). The values considered to be normal are &lt; 430 msec for males
             and &lt; 450 msec for females.

          5. Patient who signed the informed consent form. In case the patient to be underage (from
             12 to 18, -and 21 for Argentina-) the written informed consent of one of his/her
             parents or legal guardian is required.

             inclusion. In addition, they must use an effective contraceptive method (i.e. oral,
             IUD, condom, etc). The commitment of the patient to use these measures while
             participating in this clinical trial will be considered as sufficient.
