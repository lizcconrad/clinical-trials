  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the combination of cisplatin plus epirubicin in patients with
      refractory germ cell tumor not amendable to cure with surgery or standard platinum salvage
      chemotherapy. This regimen will be used in eligible patients after progression on ECOG Study
      E39897.

    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility and toxicity of combining epirubicin to fixed does cisplatin; to
      determine the partial and complete response rate and duration of remission; to determine the
      toxicity; to ascertain the potential for greater than 12 month continuous disease-free
      survival and, therefore, potential curability.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologic or serologic proof of metastatic germ cell neoplasm(gonadal or extragonadal
             primary) w/ disease not amenable to cure with either surgery or chemotherapy. Pts w/
             seminoma &amp; non-seminoma are eligible, as are women w/ ovarian germ cell tumors.

          -  Must have failed initial cisplatin combination therapy administered w/ curative
             intent. In addition, pts should have failed and demonstrated progressive disease
             following the administration of at least one &quot;salvage&quot; regimen for advanced germ cell
             neoplasms unless they have primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, or are
             considered to be a late relapse (&gt;2 yrs since becoming a complete response).

          -  Pts must have adequate system function (WBC&gt;/= 4,000 &amp; plts &gt;/=100,000; SGOT &lt;/=4x
             normal; bilirubin &lt;/=2.0; serum crt &lt;/=2.5) obtained &lt;/= 4 wks prior to entry.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1, or 2.

          -  Pts must be at least 3 weeks post major surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, and
             have recovered from all toxicity.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, unresolved infection and/or are receiving concurrent treatment w/ parenteral
             antibiotics. *Eligible after antibiotics have been discontinued for at least 7 days.

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Progression w/in 4 wks of lst course of cisplatin combination chemotherapy.
