      The purpose of this research study is to analyze the effectiveness and tolerability of a new
      medication, aripiprazole (Abilify), in individuals age 50 years and older who have bipolar
      disorder (manic-depressive illness).

    <textblock>
      While medications such as valproate (Depakote and others) and lithium are generally
      considered first-line agents in late life bipolar disorder, side effects are common, and many
      individuals with bipolar disorder continue to have symptoms in spite of medication treatment.
      A continuing unmet need is the availability of medications that are generally well- tolerated
      and effective in later life bipolar disorders.

      Antipsychotic medications such as Abilify are known to be effective for related conditions
      such as schizophrenia and are also used by some physicians in clinical settings in
      combination with mood stabilizing medications (Lithium, Depakote and others) to treat
      symptoms of bipolar disorder. Currently Abilify is approved by the FDA to treat schizophrenia
      and to treat bipolar disorder.

    <description>Patients were continued on treatment with their existing mood stabilizing medication, and upon enrollment were initiated on aripiprazole augmentation treatment. The initial starting dose of aripiprazole was 5 mg/day, with gradual upward titration as tolerated. Initiation of new additional antipsychotic medications was not permitted during the course of the study, and antipsychotic medications prescribed at study start were tapered and discontinued by week 4 of the study if possible.</description>
