    <textblock>
      The traditional procedure for cancer symptom and quality of life instrument administration is
      a paper questionnaire completed by the patient or research participant. The use of
      standardized, patient report instruments as routine assessment in clinical cancer care has
      been promoted, but infrequently reported and the utilization rate is low. Barriers to
      clinical use include the personnel cost of data collection, management of written
      questionnaires and the clinicians' unfamiliarity with the nature of the queries and numerical
      scale scores. Web-based electronic technology now has been developed and tested for
      feasibility using touchscreen, notebook computers and the computerized assessment program, a
      screening assessment providing usable and easily interpreted graphic output to cancer
      clinicians. The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate the clinical integration of
      the web-based computerized assessment in a major, multi-disciplinary academic medical center
      and cancer center. Consecutive outpatients who are evaluated for cancer therapy in each of
      the 2 setting sites, the University of Washington Medical Center and the Seattle Cancer Care
      Alliance, are able to communicate in English (or through one of the many interpreters
      available at the institutions), and are competent to understand the study information and
      give informed consent will be invited to participate. Clinicians caring for the patients in
      the sample will be invited to participate in evaluating the organizational impact. We will
      compare the outcomes of conducting assessment in the usual practices and procedures to the
      outcomes of using the computerized assessment program: appropriateness of referrals,
      efficiency, and usability. The computerized assessment will be completed prior to each
      participant's visit with the clinician, conducted at the first clinic visit, during the 4-6th
      week of treatment and again at a 30 day follow up visit. Graphical output will be immediately
      available to clinicians. Descriptive, comparative statistics will be used to evaluate the
      impact of the screening and longitudinal assessments.

      Patients with cancer, across a wide range of diagnoses and stages, have a high incidence of
      symptoms that may greatly impact quality of life. The consequences of inadequate symptom
      assessment and management are profound, complex, and can be overwhelming to patients and
      their caregivers. However, clinicians are faced too often with shrinking resources, removing
      opportunities for comprehensive, interpersonal interactions with patients. The patient's
      experience, particularly symptoms and quality of life (QOL) concerns, reported in a reliable
      and systematic way, is an essential component of the information on which a complete clinical
      assessment, diagnosis and treatment plan is based. Computer technology has been developed for
      patient self-reporting of symptom and QOL data using validated survey instruments delivered
      on notebook computers, personal digital assistants, and over the Web. Not only do these
      devices eliminate the usual steps of abstracting patient interview data and/or keying in
      marked responses, but the interfaces also permit customized, confidential and private
      assistance with answering queries more completely. While the reports are few, the results are
      positive: data integrity is enhanced by the computerized assessment, and patients prefer, and
      are easily able to complete the computerized versions. Furthermore, computerized screening
      procedures have demonstrably enhanced communication between clinicians and patients and
      successfully identified psychologically distressed patients with cancer.

        -  Clinicians and researchers developed and pilot-tested the ESRA-C prototype in 2000/2001
           at the University of Washington Medical Center Cancer Center. The successful
           implementation was published in 2004 in the Oncology Nursing Forum. [8]

        -  The purpose of this new randomized trial is to evaluate the clinical use of our
           web-based ESRA-C throughout the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.

        -  Two patients per month per team (Transplant) or per provider (Radiation Oncology,
           Medical Oncology) will be enrolled in this study.

        -  Patients will use the system to self-assess their symptoms and QOL at 2 time points,
           before (T1) and after treatment (T2)

        -  At the second, on-treatment assessment, the intervention group patients will have a
           color-graphic summary of their answers from both T1 and T2 delivered to the clinical
           team before the clinic visit with the patient.

        -  Both intervention and control participants will have the T2 clinic visit audio-recorded.
           Clinician data will be anonymously entered and audio-files destroyed.

        -  Using chart reviews we will abstract any notations, therapies ordered, prescriptions
           written and referrals made, relevant to symptoms and quality of life issues. This will
           be documented without clinician identifiers.
