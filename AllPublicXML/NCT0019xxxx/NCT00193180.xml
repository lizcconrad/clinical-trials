      This trial evaluates the novel combination of docetaxel with imatinib as first or second line
      therapy in advanced breast cancer with the aim of achieving higher effectiveness and
      potentially reducing side effects.

    <textblock>
      All patients in this study received docetaxel 30 mg/m2 weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of each
      28-day cycle, along with continuous imatinib mesylate. Initially, imatinib mesylate was given
      at a dose of 600 mg orally daily, beginning concurrently with the first dose of docetaxel;
      however, after the first 15 patients were treated it became evident that this imatinib dose
      was not tolerable, and subsequent patients received imatinib mesylate 400 mg orally daily
