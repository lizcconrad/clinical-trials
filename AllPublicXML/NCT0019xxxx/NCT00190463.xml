  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empirical antifungal treatment is the gold standard for patients who are neutropenic and have
      persistent fever under broad-spectrum antibiotics. The rational is that fungal infections are
      difficult to early diagnose, and are life-threatening. Historical trials have shown a small
      benefit of survival when this strategy is used. According to the drug usde for this strategy,
      safety and costs may be concerns. However, since this routine practice has been implemented
      in hematology, new non-invasive biological diagnostic methods are available to early diagnose
      fungal infections, such as galactomannan antigenemia for aspergillosis. The goal of our study
      is to show that limiting the administration of antifungals in this setting to patients with
      clinical foci of infection, or to patients with a positive galactomannan antigenemia reduces
      the risk of toxicity of the antifungal drug, and has no impact on the overall mortality of
      patients treated with chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.

      Patients are eligible if they have an hematologic malignancy, and receive chemotherapy with
      an expected neutropenic phase of &gt; 10 days. Patients are randomized according to a 1:1 ratio
      to receive either the usual empirical strategy (antifungals are introduced if they have
      persistent fever after 4 days of broad-spectrum antibacterials) or the pre-empirical strategy
      (administration of antifungals is limited to patients with pneumonia, septic shock,
      sinusitis, grade 3 mucositis, aspergillus colonization, liver or splenic abscesses, or
      positive galactomannan antigenemia). The antifungals administered are deoxycholate
      amphotericin B or liposome amphotericin B, according to the creatinin clearance. This
      strategy is applied during the first 14 days of persistent fever, then the therapy is left at
      the discretion of the investigator. The primary endpoint is survival at neutrophil recovery,
      or, in case of persistent neutropenia, at day 60 at the latest. Secondary objectives are the
      incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI), IFI-free survival, number of febrile days, and
      renal function at study completion.
