  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine has been closely associated with prefrontal function. The hypothesis that a lower
      dopaminergic activity is associated with negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction observed
      in the patients of schizophrenia is of a heuristic value in guiding research in this area.
      This hypothesis led us to test whether pergolide, a D1/D2 agonist, could improve negative
      symptoms and cognitive impairments prevailing in most patients with schizophrenia. This
      double-blind placebo controlled study will investigate the remedial effect of pergolide on
      negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.
