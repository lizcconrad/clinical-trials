  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing adjuvant treatment with androgen blockade
      will be followed over a 1 year interval to assess the effects of this treatment on bone
      metabolism. It is expected that men undergoing androgen blockade will experience accelerated
      bone loss.
