  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of a nurse-delivered
      psychosocial/behavioral intervention on reduction of depression in community dwelling
      post-stroke patients. We expect the combined behavioral and pharmacologic intervention to be
      more effective than pharmacotherapy alone in sustaining the improvement in depression for the
      experimental group. Secondary aims are to examine the effect of the psychosocial/behavioral
      intervention time course and sustainability of response to treatment, effect on limitations
      in ability, limitation in participation and overall stroke impact in community-dwelling
      post-stroke patients, and to compare ischemic stroke survivors who are and are not depressed
      within the first four months following stroke by their 5-HTTLPR genotypes (s/s, s/l, or l/l).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      150 patients at University of Washington affiliated hospitals who are found to be depressed
      by DSMIV criteria within the first four months following ischemic stroke will be invited to
      join the study, and randomly assigned to a problem-solving/pleasant events intervention
      provided by an advanced practice nurse, or to regular clinic follow-up. Both groups will
      receive standard antidepressant treatment and written materials from the American Stroke
      Association, and will be assessed for up to two years following the study. The primary
      outcome is reduction in depression at 12 months following stroke. Secondary outcomes are
      reductions in limitations in activity (Barthel Index), reduction in limitation in
      participation (Stroke Impact Scale) and overall stroke impact (Stroke Impact Scale) at 6, 12,
      and 24 months post- stroke. We hypothesize that all patients will improve their mood and
      functional ability related to their post-stroke standard treatment, but that those who
      receive the psychosocial intervention will have significantly greater improvement in mood,
      functional ability, social participation, and less overall stroke impact at all follow-up
      measurement. A supplemental aim is to expand aim 4 of the parent study, adding SERT genotype
      to our list of factors that might influence treatment outcome for PSD. Further, since we are
      screening both depressed and not depressed stroke survivors for this study, we will add a
      fifth aim: to compare ischemic stroke survivors who are and are not depressed within the
      first four months following stroke by their 5-HTTLPR genotypes (s/s, s/l, or l/l).
