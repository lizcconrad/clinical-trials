  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel, open-label study of patients who have responded to treatment
      in the acute phase of their manic or mixed episode, with or without psychotic symptoms, with
      olanzapine in mono or co-therapy, and who are in syndromic and symptomatic remission at the
      time of enrollment into the study.
