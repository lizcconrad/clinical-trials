      Title of the study:

      Ibandronate with or without Capecitabine in Elderly Patients with Early Breast Cancer - (ICE
      Study)

      Rationale:

      Approximately 50% of new diagnosis of early breast cancer is made in patients above the age
      of 65. As this age group has not been eligible for most trials in the past, the effect of
      adjuvant therapy is still unclear in elderly patients. The primary aim of this trial will be
      to determine the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine in elderly patients. The
      high activity, acceptable toxicity and oral formulation of this compound especially meet the
      requirements of elderly patients.

      Bisphosphonates are of established effectivity in treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.
      Furthermore, two studies have recently shown that adjuvant long term use of clodronate can
      reduce the risk of recurrence of breast cancer. The third generation bisphosphonate
      ibandronate will be given in this trial to all patients to prevent osteoporosis and
      recurrence from breast cancer, both conditions these patients are at risk. As the preference
      of elderly patients for intravenous or oral application is not known, the mode of application
      of ibandronate will be according to patients' choice and the preference and compliance will
      be a secondary endpoint.

      Primary objective

      To compare the event-free survival in elderly patients after local treatment for primary
      breast cancer treated with either ibandronate alone or ibandronate and capecitabine as
      adjuvant treatment

      Secondary objectives

      To compare the overall survival between the two arms

      To determine the compliance in both arms

      To determine the toxicity in both arms

      To determine the rate of bone-related events in hormone sensitive and insensitive disease
      (with or without endocrine therapy)

      To determine the preference to oral or intravenous application of ibandronate

      To assess quality of life

      To compare a geriatric assessment by Charlson versus VES 13 score

      Tertiary objective

      To determine prognostic factors on tumor tissue collected from primary surgery and to
      correlate them with study treatment effect

      To evaluate the prognostic impact of age, serum albumin, hemoglobin level, creatinine
      clearance, Charlson Score, VES-Score in a multivariate analysis for the prediction of
      treatment associated adverse events and limited life time expectancy
