      The objective of this study will assess the feasibility of utilizing real-time data
      monitoring in future clinical trials of weight control medications and other treatment
      modalities, along with the feasibility of distinguishing different types of relapses over 16
      weeks: There will be 4 weeks of high-intensity EMA and 12 weeks of low-intensity EMA. Each
      participant will be in the study for 52 weeks with 20 visits, including follow-up visits.

      -  Interested persons, recruited by advertisement and screened by telephone (Appendix B),
           will report to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for in-person
           screening. At the screening session, we will obtain informed consent, HIPAA consent,
           medical-history information (including current medications, alcohol, and cigarette use),
           and baseline measurements of bioelectrical impedance (BIA—body composition testing),
           blood pressure, pulse, body weight, and waist and hip circumference. Individuals will
           also be screened with established instruments for eating-disorder symptoms (Appendix C),
           and depression (Appendix D).

        -  After deemed eligible, subjects will be prescribed an individualized diet and exercise
           program at Visit 2 (Week 0). Additional questionnaires to be done at this visit:
           Restraint Scale, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), and Reasons for Dieting
           (Appendix E).

        -  At the same visit, each participant will be issued a PDA and trained in its use as an
           Electronic Diary (ED). Participants will be expected to carry their PDAs at all times.

        -  A 4-week period of high-frequency monitoring will begin immediately: random prompts to
           initiate recordings will occur 0-5 times per day for 4 weeks. Participants must respond
           to at least 85% of all random prompts within 15 minutes. Participants will also initiate
           recordings whenever they have just experienced an urge to eat, or whenever they have
           actually eaten.

        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to a Group condition or a No-Group condition.

        -  In the Group condition, participants will attend 10 group meetings, starting at Week 2
           (Visit 4), to strengthen diet-adherence and lapse-management skills. Group meetings will
           be held once every week for the first 5 weeks, and once every other week for the next 11
           weeks.

        -  In the No-group condition, participants will be given some written tips on diet
           adherence, but will not attend group.

        -  All participants must come to the clinic at scheduled times (one time per week) to
           upload information from the PDA to a central data source. Participants will also be
           weighed at these visits. This may, for some participants, coincide with the scheduled
           group meetings

        -  During Week 5-16, the frequency of EMA random prompts will be reduced to 0-2 per day.

        -  During Week 8 we will re-weigh the participant and reevaluate each participant’s diet
           and exercise program to ensure a proper and safe weight-maintenance regimen. We will
           also record the participant’s height, weight, BIA, waist and hip measurements, blood
           pressure, and pulse.

        -  A final reevaluation and weigh-in will also occur when the participant finishes the
           study (Week 17). We will also record the participant’s height, weight, BIA, waist and
           hip measurements, blood pressure, and pulse

        -  Participants will return their PDA to the clinic at this visit.

        -  At Weeks 26 and 52, participants will return for a follow-up visits at which they will
           be re-weighed and their current diet and exercise habits will be assessed. We will also
           record their height, weight, BIA, waist and hip measurements, blood pressure, and pulse.

        -  Participants will be paid $15 each time they provide ED data for upload (up to a maximum
           once per week). Subjects will receive an additional $80 for completing all 16 weeks, for
           a possible total of $320. Additionally, participants will be paid $50 for each follow-up
           visit at Weeks 26 and 52. Total compensation will be $420 for completion of the entire
           protocol. In addition, participants will be provided compensation for paying to park at
           a garage at the Johns Hopkins campus.

        -  Participants will be removed from the study if they: behave inappropriately; lose or
           damage two PDAs; miss more than three scheduled clinic visits; or fail to respond within
           15 minutes to more than 15% of random prompts during either phase 1 or 2 of EMA.
