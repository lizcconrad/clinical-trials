    <textblock>
      Among 180 patients with moderate asthma, the specific aim of this randomized trial is to
      assess the effectiveness of an intervention involving education, enhancement of
      self-efficacy, and asthma social support in preventing deterioration in functional status
      over two years.

      The goals of this study are to develop and implement a multi-component intervention to
      improve quality of life and decrease urgent resource utilization in adult asthma patients
      followed in a primary care practice. Specifically, the intervention involves a two-component
      self-directed self-management workbook. The first component focuses on increasing knowledge
      by providing patients with factual information about asthma and self-management. The second
      component focuses on asthma self-efficacy using case vignettes and making a contract to adopt
      a behavior to improve asthma. Asthma-related social support is achieved through interval
      telephone contact.

             symptoms, frequency of exacerbations, nocturnal attacks, activity restriction, use of
             medications, and pulmonary function.
