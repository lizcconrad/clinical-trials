      The purpose of the trial is to study the safety and efficacy of the Medpulser Electroporation
      System with bleomycin in the treatment of head and neck cancer.

    <textblock>
      Electroporation therapy is a tumor-specific ablative treatment modality with the potential to
      manage local tumors without the potentially undesirable side effects of systemic chemotherapy
      agents or radiotherapy. Surgical resection of solid tumors often leaves subjects with
      significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement requiring reconstructive
      surgery. In contrast, electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control to
      conventional surgery with lessened need for reconstructive surgery. Electroporation therapy
      may also provide economic benefits over conventional surgical and or radiation procedures
      through reduced operating theatre costs, hospital stays and post treatment interventions. The
      ability to shrink or eliminate local tumors with the MedPulser® System when used in
      conjunction with intralesional Bleomycin is an important new possible treatment for the
      conservative local management of SCCHN and provides a possible alternative treatment option
      to surgical excision in the management of cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of primary oral cavity, primary pharyngeal, primary laryngeal, salivary
             gland, limited recurrent and second primary tumors must be confirmed by histological
             examination of a tissue sample (e.g., biopsy) obtained within 2 months of the subject
             receiving the study treatment.

          2. The length of the longest diameter of the study lesion must be &lt; 5 cm and the
             calculated treatment volume (tumor volume plus a 0.5 cm margin around the tumor) for
             the study lesion [where treatment volume = 0.5 (a+1) (b+1)2 and where a = length of
             the longest diameter (cm), b = the next longest diameter perpendicular to &quot;a&quot; (cm)]
             must be &lt; 60.0 cm3.

          3. Age: 18 years or older.
