      Conventional psychotropic medications may be used to treat behavioral disturbances and
      psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia and they are the drugs of choice for treating
      delusions and hallucinations. However the sensitivity to side effects in these patients often
      restricts the use of these agents (2, 3). Although, atypical antipsychotics have some
      advantages compared with conventional neuroleptics, they also are associated with side
      effects (5, 6).

      Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) enhance neuronal transmission by increasing the
      availability of acetylcholine in muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. According to findings of
      some researchers ChEIs have psychotropic effects and may play an important role in
      controlling neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease
      (7-10). These agents may also contribute to the management of other disorders with
      cholinergic system abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as visual hallucinations
      (11).

      Donepezil is a piperidine-based reversible, noncompetitive ChEI, which is indicated in the
      management of patients with Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity (12-14).
      Preliminary observations suggest the possible value of ChEIs in the amelioration of psychotic
      symptoms in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), dementia with Lewy bodies
      and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (11-18).

      The results of our study (18) indicate that the addition of donepezil to perphenazine
      resulted in qualitatively superior clinical gains compared to higher doses of neuroleptic
      therapy without donepezil.

      The finding of the pilot study although impressive, stem from data regarding a rather small
      sample. The present (second) phase of the study will include a larger sample of patients. We
      now intend to examine 80 inpatients, aged 65-90 years old, suffering from DAT.

      Criteria for inclusion into the study will be: 1) DSM-IV diagnosis of Dementia of the
      Alzheimer type with psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions,
      aggression/agitation, irritability, and disinhibition that called for the administration of
      antipsychotic drugs; 2) duration of psychotic symptoms at least 2 weeks before beginning of
      treatment; 3) lack of improvement of psychotic symptoms (less than 25% on Positive and
      Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) during perphenazine treatment (8 mg/day) for at least three
      weeks; 4) drug regimen for physical disease of all patients was unchanged for at least three
      months before the study.

      Exclusion criteria include: 1) a vascular dementia; 2) concurrent Axis I DSM-IV diagnoses
      (delirium, schizophrenia, delusional disorders, and affective disorders) 3) significant
      medical illness (cardiovascular, liver, renal, endocrinal, vitamin B12 or folic acid
      deficiency, and neurological illnesses); 4) drug or/and alcohol addiction.

      The study design will be a double blind group study, lasting for 9 weeks. Complete physical
      and laboratory examinations will be performed on all inpatients. Subjects will be randomized
      in a 1:1 fashion to receive treatment with 4 mg of perphenazine or 5 mg of donepezil or
      placebo in addition to the perphenazine treatment (8 mg/day) that they have received for the
      past 3 weeks (baseline). According to mental state (improvement less than 20% on PANSS
      scores), perphenazine dose will be elevated by 4 mg/day to maximum 16 mg/day in the first
      group, and donepezil dose will be increased by 5 mg/day to maximum 10 mg/day in the second
      group) and placebo will be elevated up to 2 capsules/day in the third group. All preparations
      will be administered in identical capsules made by a professional pharmacist, and supplied in
      individual number-coded packages.

      Assessments for psychotic symptoms will be done using PANSS and CGI at baseline and repeated
      weekly. Assessments for extrapyramidal side effects will be done using AIMS at baseline and
      repeated every week. In addition, both at the beginning and at the end of the study, all
      patients will be assessed with MMSE and GDS. Complete blood profiles, and urine analysis will
      be performed at screening and at week 9.
