    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 different methods of combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the
      treatment of localised lung cancer in patients not suitable for surgery.

      Hypothesis(es) to be tested:

        1. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy is superior to gemcitabine +
           high dose palliative radiotherapy in terms of efficacy in a multi-institutional setting

        2. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy is superior to gemcitabine +
           high dose palliative radiotherapy in terms of feasibility in a multi-institutional
           setting

        3. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy has a favourable toxicity
           profile relative to gemcitabine + high-dose palliative radiotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A third of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with Stage IIIA or IIIB
      disease, which is not amenable to curative resection. Single modality local therapy, either
      surgery or radiation, only cures a fraction of such patients.

      Radical radiation is not feasible for all patients with unresectable Stage IIIA or IIIB
      non-small cell lung cancer, based upon the extent of the loco-regional disease or the medical
      state of the patient. Patients of good performance status receiving protracted high-dose
      palliative radiotherapy do obtain a survival benefit from this therapy. Studies have shown a
      survival advantage by adding chemotherapy to radical radiation therapy: but studies in the
      high-dose palliative radiotherapy setting are lacking. Two regimens of concurrent
      chemotherapy with high-dose palliative radiotherapy have been developed locally, with
      established MTDs. These 2 regimens do warrant a comparative assessment in a phase II trial,
      prior to a phase III trial against high dose palliative radiation alone (36Gy/12#/5).

      This is a randomised phase II trial comprising of 2 arms for randomization as follows:

      Arm A:External beam radiation, 40 Gy/20#/5 per week, Plus concurrent Vinorelbine, IV,
      25mg/m2, days 1, 8, 22 and + Cisplatin 20mg/m2, IV, weekly

      Arm B:External beam radiation, 30 Gy/15#/5 per week, Plus concurrentGemcitabine, 200mg (flat
      dose) IV days 1, 8, 15

      An equal number of patients will be randomised to each arm. The randomisation will be carried
      out by the Princess Alexandra Trial Centre.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and then at 3 weeks, 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks post treatment then 3 monthly thereafter.

          -  All potential patients, prior to registration, must be reviewed at a multidisciplinary
             lung oncology meeting attended by medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and
             radiologists.

          -  No prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1.

          -  Adequate hepatic, bone marrow and renal function.

          -  If patient is female of child bearing potential, she must not be pregnant or
             lactating. Males and females of reproductive potential must practise adequate
             contraception.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient unable to receive all therapy as an outpatient.

          -  Significant medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator would

             potentially exacerbated by these modalities.

          -  History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix) unless in complete remission and off all therapy for that cancer for at
             least 5 years.

          -  Receiving treatment with another investigational agent.
