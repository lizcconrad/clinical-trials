    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled trial of Humatrope (somatropin) treatment in girls with Turner
      syndrome at least 7 years old and younger than 13 at study entry.

      Core study objectives are to determine the efficacy of Humatrope in promoting linear growth
      to final height in girls with Turner syndrome, and to assess the safety of this treatment.
      Core study completion criteria (protocol final height) are that the patient has both a height
      velocity &lt; 2 cm per year and a bone age of 14 years or greater.

      Addendum 1 provides the option of Humatrope treatment to patients who were randomized to the
      Control arm of the Core study and who discontinued from the study on or after December 19,
      1997.

      Addendum 2 objectives are: 1) to collect true final height data; 2) to evaluate hearing,
      tympanic membrane function and other specific areas of interest with respect to the safety of
      growth hormone therapy in Turner syndrome; 3) to evaluate pancreatic beta cell function
      (glucose metabolism) in patients previously enrolled in the Core study.

      Addendum 3 objective is to determine the parental origin of the retained X chromosome of an
      appropriate subset of patients currently or previously enrolled in the Core study, and to
      determine whether this parental origin holds any predictive value for spontaneous growth or
      for response to growth hormone therapy.

          <title>Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) [Lyon]</title>
          <description>SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS [Lyon] uses the Turner syndrome reference height values for age (Lyon AJ et al. 1985) as the population mean and standard deviation. Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual’s height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation. Since the data reported by Lyon AJ et al represent a Turner syndrome reference standard, values for patients with Turner syndrome are centered around zero.</description>

          <title>Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]), Last Measurement After Attainment of Final Height</title>
          <description>SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS [NCHS] uses the NCHS US general female population reference height values for age (Kuczmarski RJ et al. 2000) as the population mean and standard deviation. Calculation of Height SDS is provided in Height SDS [Lyon] description (Baseline). Since data reported by Kuczmarski RJ et al provides US general female population standards, values of Height SDS [NCHS] for untreated patients with Turner syndrome tend to be below zero e.g, -2.0 to -4.0 SDS.</description>
