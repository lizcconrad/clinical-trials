  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of daclizumab in
      preventing the progression of diabetes in children who have just been diagnosed with type I
      diabetes. Additional purposes of the study are to investigate the amount of drug in the
      children, how quickly it is eliminated from the blood, and analyze the effect of the drug on
      the immune reaction to diabetes.
