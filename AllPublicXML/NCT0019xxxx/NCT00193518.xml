  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Additional active agents are needed to further improve the treatment of patients with
      CLL/SLL. Increasing information exists regarding the activity of arsenic trioxide in other
      hematologic malignancies. Since arsenic trioxide produces mild to moderate myelosuppression
      and is not as immunosuppressive as other available agents, it may be an additional treatment
      option for CLL/SLL. This study will evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of arsenic trioxide
      in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL
