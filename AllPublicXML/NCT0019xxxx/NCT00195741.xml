        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject and subject's legal representative have voluntarily signed and dated an
             IRB-approved informed assent form and an IRB-approved informed consent form,
             respectively, before any study-specific procedures or tests are performed, including
             the discontinuation of any prohibited medications

          -  Subject is male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female;

          -  Subject is between 12 and 17 years of age, inclusive, at randomization;

          -  Subject weighs between 77 lbs (i.e., 35 kg) and 220 lbs (i.e., 100 kg) inclusive;

          -  Subject currently has migraine headaches diagnosed according to the International
             Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria occurring at an average frequency of at
             least 3, but no more than 12, migraine headaches per month during the 3 months prior
             to screening. Migraine headaches separated by a headache-free interval of &lt; 48 hours
             will be considered one migraine headache in assessing this criterion;

          -  Subject's initial onset of migraine headache precedes the Screening Visit by at least
             12 months;

          -  Subject is judged to be in generally good health based on the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory
             profile. When the Screening and Baseline Visits are combined as described in Section
             5.1, continuing participation in the Baseline Phase will be contingent upon laboratory
             and ECG results. Any repeat laboratory testing must be completed in consultation with
             the Abbott Medical Monitor prior to randomization.

        Experimental Phase

          -  The following criteria define eligibility for subject enrollment in the

        Experimental Phase and subsequent randomization and study drug assignment:

          -  Subject experienced at least 3, but no more than 12, migraine headaches (separated by
             headache-free intervals of at least 48 hours), diagnosed according to the IHS
             diagnostic criteria,6 during the 4-week Baseline Phase of the study; and

          -  Subject is still eligible for the study based on Baseline Phase inclusion criteria.
