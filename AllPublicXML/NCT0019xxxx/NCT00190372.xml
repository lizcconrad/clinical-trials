      The aim of the project is to demonstrate that a psycho-educational programme designed to
      support and train carers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients induces a significantly higher
      benefit than anticholinesterase drug treatment alone or associated to memantine treatment.
      This training programme focuses on the explanation/description of behavioral, cognitive and
      functional disorders induced by the disease, as well as principles of cognitive and
      psycho-social stimulation of the patients in daily life.

      Context: Research showing the benefit of a combined approach including specific antidementia
      drugs and psycho-educational programmes for caregivers in the caring of Alzheimer's disease
      patients is still lacking. We venture the hypothesis that combined treatment including a
      specific antidementia drug for the AD patient and a psycho-educational programme for the
      caregivers has a larger benefit for both the patient and the caregiver on psychological,
      behavioural, and cognitive parameters.

      Main objective: to demonstrate that a psycho-educational programme designed to support and
      train carers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients induces a significantly higher benefit than
      anticholinesterase drug treatment alone or associated to memantine treatment.

      Secondary objective: identify patterns of responders and non-responders (taking into account
      cognitive, psychological parameters).

      Methodology: national multicentric, randomized trial, single blinded, with 2 parallel groups
      of 120 patients and 120 caregivers trained for a 3 month period with 3 assessments: before,
      just after and 3 months after the training period. Patients and caregivers are recruited
      (according to exclusion and inclusion criteria) and followed up in memory centers
      participating in the trial.

      Evaluation criteria:

      Primary criteria for the patient: DAD scale (Disability Assessment for Dementia).

      Secondary evaluation criteria - for the patient: NPI and ADAS-Cog; for the caregiver: ZARIT
      scale, Questionnaire of feeling of competency, Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale
      (MADRS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).

      Statistical analysis by the department of biostatistics and medical computing of the Hospital
      Cochin will be performed.
