      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with temozolomide can effect the
      survival of patients with advanced breast cancer or soft tissue sarcoma.

      Because repeated dosing of temozolomide correlates with an improved response, which may be
      due to progressive depletion of the enzyme AT, our hope is that a daily oral schedule will be
      the most active schedule of this agent. In phase I studies doses below 85 mg/m2/day
      continuously have been well-tolerated. We plan to begin dosing at 75 mg/m2/day for 6 weeks
      out of an 8 week cycle and to escalate to 85 and 100 mg/m2/day in patients who have no grade
      3/4 toxicity.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with temozolomide can effect the
      survival of patients with advanced breast cancer or soft tissue sarcoma. To do this we will
      assess the response rate, time to progression, and survival in patients with advanced breast
      cancer or soft tissue sarcoma who are treated with temozolomide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have either:

          -  Stage IV, microscopically-confirmed carcinoma of the breast with:

               -  Relapse or progression while receiving, or within 12 months of having received,
                  an anthracycline-containing (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone) or taxane-containing
                  (paclitaxel or docetaxel) regimen as either adjuvant treatment or therapy for
                  advanced breast cancer, or

               -  Treatment to a maximum dose of anthracycline (e.g., greater than 450 mg/m2 of
                  doxorubicin), or

               -  A dose-limiting toxicity from a taxane, or

               -  An ECOG performance status of 2.

                    -  OR â€”

          -  Unresectable or metastatic, microscopically-confirmed soft tissue sarcoma, that is not
             amenable to treatment with Adriamycin or Ifosfamide due to:

               -  Poor cardiac reserve, or

               -  Poor performance status (ECOG performance status = 2) or

               -  Having failed treatment with Adriamycin or reached dose-limiting toxicity from
                  chemotherapy.

        Patients must have histologic slides and/or blocks must be available for review.

        screen and on the first day of treatment.

        Patients must have a life expectancy more than 16 weeks.

        Patients must be informed consent must be obtained prior to enrollment.

        therapy to the pelvis, spine or long bones; more than 3 weeks from prior chemotherapy (more

        therapy.

        Visceral crisis characterized by rapidly progressive hepatic or lymphangitic lung
        metastases (i.e. patients whose disease is beyond control).

        Medically unstable (i.e. with uncontrolled disease); diagnosis of other systemic cancer.

        Pregnancy or lactation; failure to employ adequate contraception.

        Uncontrolled CNS disease.
