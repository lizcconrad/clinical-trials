  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial we will evaluate and compare the efficacy and toxicity of oral topotecan with
      intravenous docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

        -  Topotecan

        -  Docetaxel

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Topotecan) and 1 will receive
      treatment B (Docetaxel). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will
      know which treatment has been assigned.
