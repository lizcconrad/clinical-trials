      To establish the efficacy of a 20 mg/d dose of istradefylline for reducing the percentage of
      OFF time in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa. Patients
      who meet entry criteria will be randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to either istradefylline or
      matching placebo. Patients will be treated for 12 weeks and will have interim visits and end
      of treatment visit to assess the efficacy and safety of istradefylline as compared to
      placebo.
