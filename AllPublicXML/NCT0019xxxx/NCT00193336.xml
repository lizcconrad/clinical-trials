  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the demonstrated single agent activity and excellent tolerability in patients with
      refractory non-small cell lung cancer, ZD1839 may be of benefit in the first-line treatment
      of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have poor performance status. In
      this phase II trial, we will investigate the single agent activity of first-line ZD1839 in
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with poor performance status
