        <description>Number of participants with PCS ECG findings is reported on-therapy (OT) and at final visit (FV). Criteria for PCS ECG findings: heart rate (HR) =&lt;45 beats/minute (bpm) and decrease (Dec) &gt;15/&gt;=120 bpm and decrease of &gt;15 bpm; PR interval (Int) &gt;=220 millisecond (msec), increase (Inc) &gt;=20 msec, QRS Int &gt;=120 msec, corrected QT (QTc) and QTc using fridericia formula(QTcF) Int &gt;500 msec, increase &gt;60 msec; no sinus rhythm; overall ECG abnormal. Participants with at least 1 measurement exceeding the criteria for PCS are reported.</description>

          <population>Analysis population included all participants who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants evaluable for specific time points.</population>
