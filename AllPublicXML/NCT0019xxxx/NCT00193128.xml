  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II trial, we will evaluate a novel combination of chemotherapy, used
      concurrently with radiation therapy, in the preoperative therapy of locoregional carcinoma of
      the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. In the brief phase I portion of this trial, we
      will determine whether 2 drugs (docetaxel/oxaliplatin) or 3 drugs
      (docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine) can be used concurrently with radiation therapy. If the
      3-drug regimen is tolerated, the phase II portion will proceed with this regimen. If the
      3-drug combination is considered too toxic, the phase II study will proceed with
      docetaxel/oxaliplatin in combination with radiation therapy.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

      Oxaliplatin + Docetaxel + Capecitabine + Radiation therapy

      If the three-drug chemotherapy regimen, with radiation therapy, is tolerable, this regimen
      will be taken forward into the phase II portion of the trial. If the three-drug regimen is
      too toxic, the phase II portion will proceed with the two-drug regimen Oxaliplatin +
      Docetaxel + Radiation therapy
