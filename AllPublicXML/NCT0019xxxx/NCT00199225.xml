      This phase I trial will evaluate the effects of rupatadine, at a dose of 10 mg OD (authorised
      and marketed dose) and the 100mg/day (supratherapeutic dose) on the ECG parameters with a
      special focus on its effect on cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval duration).Furthermore,
      the study is performed to assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between
      plasma concentration of rupatadine and its effects, if any, on cardiac repolarisation mainly
      in the QTc interval).

      The main objective is to assess whether administration of a repeated dose of 10 and 100
      mg/day , has the potential to cause QT prolongation in healthy volunteers.

      Recently, as FDA as EMEA provides recommendations to sponsors concerning the design, conduct,
      analysis and interpretation of clinical studies to assess the potential for delaying cardiac
      repolarisation. This paper recommends to perform a ‘through Qt/QTc’ study to expand ECGs
      safety evaluation during later stages of drug development. It was recomended that the study
      was randomized, blind and placebo controlled. Moreover, as a high sensitivy is necessary in
      order to detect differences in the QTc measure, it was essential a positive control included.
      On that basis, the positive control should be well-characterized and consistently produce an
      effect corresponding to the largest change in the QT/QTc interval that is currently viewed as
      clinically not important to detect (a mean change of around 5 ms. Because of this, we decide
      select as positive control: moxifloxacin, used in the most of similar phase I clinical
      trials.

      In these type of studies, as recommended by the guidelines, there should be a caracterization
      to ensure that the dose-response and generally the concentration-response relationship for
      QT/QTc prolongation, including exploration of concentrations that are higher than those
      achieved following the therapeutic doses. So, thererfore, we decided use 100 mg/daY (10 times
      the therapeutic dose) as supratherapeutic dose to be administered.

      We decide propose a new phase I study as recommended guidelines (a single-blind, randomised,
      placebo and active-controlled, parallel design). With this, we’ve tried complet the
      rupatadine effects over QTc and another electrocardiographic parameters and valued the
      risk-benefit relationship for this new antiH1 and PAF antagonist

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for admission to the
        study:

          1. Male or female between 18 and 45 years old (inclusive)

          2. In good health as determined by the principal investigator based on medical history,
             physical examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          3. Body Mass Index between 19 and 27 kg/m2.

          4. Non-smokers (refrained from any tobacco usage, including smokeless tobacco, nicotine
             patches, etc., for 6 months prior to the administration of the study medication)
