  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure induces modification in several neurohormonal systems. The aim of this study is
      to determine if the growth hormone/IGF1 axis is modified in heart failure patients compared
      to healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and sixty three heart failure patients were evaluated by clinical examination,
      echocardiography, exercise test and measurement of blood BNP. Growth hormone and IGF-1 plasma
      levels were determined in each patient. The same biological measurements were performed in a
      group of 148 healthy controls. Comparisons were performed between groups for Growth hormone
      plasma level, IGF-1 plasma level and Growth hormone/IGF-1 index. A correlation between the
      severity of heart failure and the different biological parameters was searched.
