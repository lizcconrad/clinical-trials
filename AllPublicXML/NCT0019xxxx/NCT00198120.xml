      This project proposes to study the efficacy and safety of D-cycloserine in children with
      autism. The central hypothesis of this project is that D-cycloserine will be efficacious in
      reducing certain symptoms of autism including some aspects of social impairment.

      Autism is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of at least 0.1 %. Despite
      investigations into the pharmacologic treatment of autism, no drugs have been shown to
      consistently improve the core symptoms of the disorder, namely social and communication
      impairment. Pilot data has suggested that D-cycloserine, a drug that affects the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, has efficacy for the symptom of
      social withdrawal in autism. In this study, children with autism will be randomly assigned to
      treatment with either D-cycloserine or placebo for 8 weeks. Both the subjects and
      investigators will be blind to treatment assignment. Subjects will be rated on a variety of
      clinical measures to examine the effects of D-cycloserine on social withdrawal and other
      symptoms of autism. Safety data including side-effects, vital signs, blood tests, and
      electrocardiograms will be performed at the beginning and end of the study. This study will
      provide important information about the effects of D-cycloserine for treating core and
      associated symptoms of autism. It will also greatly expand the knowledge about glutamatergic
      agents in autism and provide crucial information regarding the pathophysiology and future
      design of drug studies in autism.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 3 Years to 12 Years

          -  Diagnostic Statistical Manual Version -IV (DSM-IV) and Autism Diagnostic Interview -
             Revised (ADI-R)-confirmed Diagnosis of Autistic Disorder

          -  Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Lethargy Subscale Score of 13 or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with Severe to Profound Mental Retardation

          -  Weight at Screening Visit &lt;11 kilograms

          -  Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Score of 7

          -  Presence of a Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Possible Associations to Autism:
             Subjects with Fragile X Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, or other neurodevelopmental
             disorders known to be associated with autism or autistic features will be excluded.

          -  Presence of a Psychiatric Disorder that would Require a Specific Type of Treatment:
             Subjects with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or a psychotic disorder
             will be excluded because treatment for these disorders often requires specific
             psychotropic agents. Subjects with an active substance use disorder will be excluded
             because of safety concerns and problems this would cause in assessing efficacy.

          -  Presence of a Medical Condition that would make Treatment with D-Cycloserine Less
             Safe: Subjects with significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease will be excluded
             due to concerns about pharmacokinetic alterations or adverse effects. Subjects with
             epilepsy or a history of seizures will be excluded due to rare reports of seizures
             with high doses of D-cycloserine. D-cycloserine is an U.S. FDA Pregnancy Category C
             drug. Because of the unknown effects of D-cycloserine on the developing human fetus,
             females of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test and required to
             use a suitable form of birth control during the study.
