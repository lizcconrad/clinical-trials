      The goals of this study are to:

        1. determine the diarrheal rates, morbidity, mortality, and pathogens present among
           breast-fed infants born to HIV-infected mothers.

             -  analysis by HIV status of infants, method of feeding, HIV viral loads / CD4 counts
                of infected mothers.

             -  comparison to rates among infants born to HIV uninfected mothers.

        2. link analysis of the functional quality of immunoglobulins in the breast milk of
           HIV-infected and uninfected mothers.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Diarrheal specimens from infants born to HIV infected mothers</arm_group_label>
    <description>400 diarrheal specimens will suffice to determine the prevalence of specific pathogens in the region. Of these, 300 specimens will be collected from infants born to HIV infected mothers, and 100 specimens will be collected from infants born to HIV uninfected mothers.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Breast milk from HIV infected and HIV uninfected women</arm_group_label>
    <description>Breast milk from HIV infected and HIV uninfected women who are breastfeeding is collected at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, and 5 months post-partum. This breast milk will be compared for in vitro functional quality of immunoglobulins to selected diarrheal and respiratory pathogens.</description>
