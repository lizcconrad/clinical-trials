      The purpose of the study is to study the safety and efficacy of MedPulser Electroporation
      with bleomycin treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous foci of cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electroporation therapy (EPT) is a tumor-specific ablative treatment modality with the
      potential to manage local tumors without the potentially undesirable side effects of systemic
      chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy. Surgical resection of cutaneous lesions may lead to
      significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement requiring reconstructive surgery
      (i.e. nose, eye area, ears, medial canthus, nasolabial fold, lip, scalp, etc.). In contrast,
      electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control to conventional surgery with a
      lessened need for reconstructive surgery.

      The ability to ablate local cutaneous lesions with the MedPulserÂ® System when used in
      conjunction with intralesional Bleomycin is an important new treatment for the local
      management of recurrent Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC),
      Melanoma, Adenocarcinoma (i.e. local recurrence of breast cancer), Merkel Cell Carcinoma and
      Cutaneous Lymphoma and other solid tumors with symptomatic subcutaneous recurrences and
      provides an alternative treatment option to subjects who:

        1. have failed standard treatments; or who

        2. are unwilling or unsuitable to undergo conventional surgical excision or radiation.

      EPT with Bleomycin spares normal tissue and its use in local disease management may preserve
      organ function and/or appearance relative to surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of recurrent SCC, recurrent BCC, melanoma, adenocarcinoma (i.e., local
             recurrence of breast cancer), merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphoma, other
             subcutaneous solid tumors, or primary cutaneous tumors must be confirmed by
             histological examination of a tissue (e.g., biopsy) sample obtained within 1 month
             prior to a patient signing the informed consent form for the study.

          2. Total volume of disease treated will require a dose of bleomycin sulfate less than 80
             units.

          3. Tumors and margins must be completely accessible to intralesional bleomycin injections
             and the EPT applicator electrodes.

          4. Age: 18 years or older.

          5. Male or female.

          6. Men and women of childbearing potential must be using physician prescribed
             contraceptive methods while undergoing protocol related therapy.

          7. Baseline performance status: ECOG 0-2

               -  Grade 0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without
                  restriction.
