      -  To compare immune responses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella antigens following
           vaccination in children who receive FluMist concurrently with MMRIIÒ and VARIVAXÒ and in
           children who receive an intranasal placebo mist concurrently with MMRIIÒ and VARIVAXÒ
           (Group 2 vs. Group 1).

        -  To compare immune responses to the three strains of influenza (H1N1, H3N2, and B)
           following a two dose regimen of FluMist in children who receive the initial FluMist dose
           concurrently with MMRIIÒ and VARIVAXÒ and in children who receive two doses of FluMist
           alone (Group 2 vs. Group 3).Secondary:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent administration of FluMist with
           MMRIIÒ and VARIVAXÒ.
