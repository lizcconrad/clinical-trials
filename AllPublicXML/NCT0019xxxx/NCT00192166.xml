      - The primary objective of the study was to determine if intranasally administered influenza
      virus vaccine, CAIV-T), when administered concomitantly with a subcutaneously administered
      combination live, attenuated mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) virus vaccine to children
      interferes with the immune responses.

      -  The primary objective of the study was to determine if intranasally administered
           influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live, cold-adapted (CAIV-T), when
           administered concomitantly with a subcutaneously administered combination live,
           attenuated mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) virus vaccine to children aged 11 to less
           than 24 months, interferes with the immune responses to the measles, mumps, and rubella
           components of the MMR vaccine.

        -  To compare the efficacy over one season against culture-confirmed influenza-illness
           caused by community-acquired subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the
           vaccine, in children who are aged at least 11 months and less than 24 months at
           enrollment, between those who receive two doses of CAIV-T and those who receive placebo,
           each with concomitant administration of a combination live, attenuated MMR vaccine
           administered prior to the anticipated commencement of the influenza season.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             corticosteroids given daily or on alternate days, for 14 days or more, were excluded
             from vaccination until corticosteroid therapy was discontinued for at least one month.
             High doses were defined as 2 mg/kg/day or more of prednisolone or its equivalent, or
