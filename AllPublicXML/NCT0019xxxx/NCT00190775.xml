  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel design, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 38-week treatment
      trial of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who are
      currently living in a family situation with at least one child. The primary objective of the
      study is to demonstrate the efficacy of atomoxetine compared to placebo in the reduction of
      ADHD symptoms over 12 and 24 weeks of blinded treatment.

          <description>30-item scale containing 3 subscales: inattention (9 items), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (9 items), and ADHD Index (12 items). Each item is scored 0-3 (0=not at all/never; 1=just a little/once in a while; 2=pretty much/often; 3=very much/very frequently). Total ADHD symptoms score=sum of the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales. Total Scores range from 0-54 (range of 0-27 for the inattention and hyperactivity subscales; 0-36 for the ADHD Index) with higher scores indicating more impaired participants. The scale was administered by a physician/PhD at the investigative site.</description>

Participants completed the DRS scale, a 42-item self-report scale providing quantitative indices of family strengths/weaknesses. Items are rated 0-3 (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

          <title>Family Assessment Measure III (FAM) Dyadic Relationship Scale (DRS) - Spouse/Significant Other</title>
          <description>FAM consists of 3 components: General Scale; Dyadic Relationships Scale (DRS), and Self-Rating Scale. The spouse/significant other completed the DRS scale, a 42-item self-report scale providing quantitative indices of family strengths/weaknesses. Items are rated 0-3 (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

          <description>The PSI 19-item Stress Life Events scale has yes/no responses and measures situational circumstances beyond control (death of family member, divorce, etc.) in the past 12 months. Maximum score (all answers=yes) is 79; a Life Stress raw score &gt;=17 indicates high stress. Each question is weighted based upon the event. Total Score measures relative magnitude of stress in parent-child system. High scores (&gt;=85th percentile) indicate higher stress. Total Stress &gt;=258 is indicative of impairment. Participants with a child aged 6-12 or 13-17 years living at home completed the scale.</description>

          <description>Self-report scale completed by the participant. Separate scales measure state (20 items) and trait (20 items) anxiety. The participant reports how they feel “right now at this moment” for state anxiety and how they “generally” feel for trait anxiety. The “state” items are scored as: 1 (not at all), 2 (somewhat true), 3 (moderately true), 4 (very true). The “trait” items are scored as: 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), 4 (almost always). Scores range from 4-80 for each scale. Higher scores indicate more impaired participants.</description>

Participants completed the DRS scale, a 42-item self-report scale providing quantitative indices of family strengths/weaknesses. Items are rated 0-3 (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

        <description>FAM consists of 3 components: General Scale; Dyadic Relationships Scale (DRS), and Self-Rating Scale. Participants completed the DRS scale, a 42-item self-report scale providing quantitative indices of family strengths/weaknesses. Items are rated 0-3 (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

        <description>FAM consists of 3 components: General Scale; Dyadic Relationships Scale (DRS), and Self-Rating Scale. The spouse/significant other completed the DRS scale, a 42-item self-report scale providing quantitative indices of family strengths/weaknesses. Items are rated 0-3 (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). Raw scores=0-18 (each subscale) and are converted to a t-score (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10; scores range from 0-100). T-scores should be between 40-60. T-scores &gt;=60 indicate disturbance in family functioning.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) - Spouse/Significant Other</title>
          <description>32-item self-report scale to assess quality of the relationship perceived by the spouse/significant other. Response anchors vary and include a 5-, 6- or 7-point Likert scale (always agree/disagree; all the time/never); and 2 yes/no items. Assesses 4 relationship aspects (# items): dyadic satisfaction (10), cohesion (5), and consensus (13), and affectional expression (4). Raw score total=0-151 and is converted to a t-score (0-100; mean=50, SD=10). T-scores of 45-55 indicate a typical score (no concern). Scores &lt;30 indicate significant impairment. Lower scores indicate poorer dyadic adjustment.</description>

        <description>120-item scale includes 101 items rated on 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree/strongly disagree) or 4-5 point multiple choices. Adult Domain characteristics’ subscales and score ranges include: Competence (13-65), Isolation (6-30), Attachment (7-35), Health (5-25), Role Restriction (7-35), Depression (9-45), Spouse (7-35). Total Score measures relative magnitude of stress in parent-child system. Parent Domain score &gt;=148 (&gt;=85th percentile) is indicative of impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Score - Total Stress and Life Stress</title>
        <description>The PSI 19-item Stress Life Events scale has yes/no responses and measures situational circumstances beyond control (death of family member, divorce, etc.) in the past 12 months. Maximum score (all answers=yes) is 79; a Life Stress raw score &gt;=17 indicates high stress. Each question is weighted based upon the event. Total Score measures relative magnitude of stress in parent-child system. High scores (&gt;=85th percentile) indicate higher stress. Total Stress &gt;=258 is indicative of impairment. Participants with a child aged 6-12 or 13-17 years living at home completed the scale.</description>

        <description>120-item scale includes 101 items rated on 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree/strongly disagree) or 4-5 point multiple choices. Child Domain characteristics’ subscales and score ranges include: Distractibility/Hyperactivity (9-45), Adaptability (11-55), Reinforces Parent (6-30), Demandingness (9-45), Mood (5-25), Acceptability (7-35). Total Score measures relative magnitude of stress in parent-child system. A Child Domain score &gt;=116 (&gt;=85th percentile) is indicative of impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) Scale</title>
        <description>16-item scale to assess parenting self-esteem: the Satisfaction Subscale has 9 questions (2,3,4,5,8,9,12,14,16)=54; the Efficacy Subscale has 7 questions (1,6,7,10,11,13,15)=43. Each response on the satisfaction subscale is answered on a 6-point scale (strongly agree/strongly disagree). Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction and greater self-efficacy. Lower scores mean more impairment. Participants with a child aged 6-12 or 13-17 years living at home completed the scale.</description>

The participant reports how they feel “right now at this moment” for state anxiety and how they “generally” feel for trait anxiety.

        <description>30-item scale containing 3 subscales: inattention (9 items), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (9 items), and ADHD Index (12 items). Each item is scored 0-3 (0=not at all/never; 1=just a little/once in a while; 2=pretty much/often; 3=very much/very frequently). Total ADHD symptoms score=sum of the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales. Total Scores range from 0-54 (range of 0-27 for the inattention and hyperactivity subscales; 0-36 for the ADHD Index) with higher scores indicating more impaired participants. The scale was administered by a physician/PhD at the investigative site.</description>
