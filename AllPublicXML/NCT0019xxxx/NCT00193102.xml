  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of non-overlapping toxicities between the two drugs, the ease of all oral drug
      administration, and the possibility for antitumor synergy make exploration of this
      combination regimen attractive in women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.
      This phase II trial will be performed in collaboration with the Minnie Pearl Cancer Research
      Network, a multicenter, community-based clinical trials group.
