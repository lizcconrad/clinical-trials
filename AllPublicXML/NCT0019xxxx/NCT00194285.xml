  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed research study is to determine the efficacy of [18-F]
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in differentiating infections
      from other complications such as loosening in patients with painful joint prosthesis. We
      intend to validate and establish the necessary criteria for making such a diagnosis and
      determine the accuracy of the technique through comparison with other existing modalities
      such as white blood imaging and patient outcome. We expect that at the completion of the
      proposed research, the role of this novel and powerful imaging modality will be clearly
      defined in the management of patients with this challenging and serious complication.

      The purposes of this study are: 1. To determine the normal pattern of FDG uptake demonstrated
      by pet up to two years following total joint replacement surgery 2. To establish the optimal
      diagnostic criteria for differentiating septic from aseptic painful joint prosthesis by
      FDG-PET imaging and determine its accuracy 3. To compare the accuracy of FDG-PET imaging to
      conventional techniques for the differentiation of septic from aseptic painful joint
      prostheses.

      We intend to enroll 100 patients per year for 5 years. These patients will be selected from
      more than 300 cases that undergo joint revisions at the collaborating institutions. After
      each patient undergoes an appropriate evaluation including history, physical examination,
      radiographic and laboratory evaluation, he/she will be assigned into one of the groups listed
      below based on the degree of suspicion of an infectious process. Every effort will be made to
      have approximately one-third of the patients recruited from each of the following groups.

      Study Plan Study I: FDG-PET imaging in the painful partial or total joint prosthesis We
      intend to enroll 100 patients per year for 5 years. These patients will be selected from more
      than 300 cases that undergo joint revisions at the collaborating institutions. After each
      patient undergoes an appropriate evaluation including history, physical examination,
      radiographic and laboratory evaluation, he/she will be assigned into one of the groups listed
      below based on the degree of suspicion of an infectious process. Every effort will be made to
      have approximately one-third of the patients recruited from each of the following groups.

      Group 1: Low pre-scan suspicion of infection. The incidence of infection based on past
      experience is &lt;10% in this population.

      Group 2: High pre-scan suspicion of infection. The incidence of infection in this group is
      quite high based on past experience.

      Group 3: Intermediate pre-scan suspicion of infection. Criteria: Any patient who does not fit
      into either group 1 or 2 will be considered for this category. The incidence of infection in
      this group based on past experience is intermediate.

      Considering the large number of patients who undergo joint revision (more than 300 annually)
      in the participating institutions combined, we expect no difficulties in recruiting adequate
      numbers in all 3 categories.

      Each patient will undergo only one preoperative diagnostic FDG-PET scan. After the PET scan
      is completed, a diagnosis and detailed description of the observations made will be
      communicated to the attending surgeon before the operation. We believe this information will
      enable investigators to establish the correct diagnosis during surgical intervention.

      Study II: FDG-PET imaging following uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty To
      accomplish this goal, we will enroll 10 patients per year for the first 3 years. FDG-PET
      scans will be performed at approximately 12 months, 18 months and/or 2 years following
      surgery. All scans will occur within 2 months of the 12-, 18-, and/or 24-month anniversary of
      that patient's most recent joint replacement surgery. It is unknown how long FDG uptake
      persists in an uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty. The expected pattern of FDG
      uptake following arthroplasty will provide a basis for the correct diagnosis of
      periprosthetic infection and loosening during the life of the implant.

        Five hundred patients selected for entry into this study will be men or women of any ethnic
        background who are scheduled to undergo clinical and diagnostic evaluation for joint
        prosthesis revision by members of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of
        Pennsylvania Health System (Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania
        Hospital) or by the collaborating physicians at the Rothman Institute at Thomas Jefferson
        University Hospital or the VA Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients selected for entry into this study will be men or women of any ethnic
             background who are scheduled to undergo clinical and diagnostic evaluation by a member
             of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Hospital of the University of
             Pennsylvania Health System or by the collaborating physicians at the Rothman Institute
             or the VA Philadelphia Medical Center.

        Study I: FDG-PET imaging in painful partial or total joint prostheses Each patient who is a
        candidate will be evaluated by one of the collaborators mentioned above for a painful
        partial or total joint prosthesis. The patient will undergo an appropriate routine
        evaluation including history, physical examination, radiographic, scintigraphic, and
        necessary laboratory evaluation. An initial diagnosis must be made for each patient. The
        diagnosis of loosening will be established based on clinical examination and/or
        radiographic evaluation demonstrating clear evidence of this complication. Other etiologies
        for the joint pain, except for infection and aseptic loosening, need to be excluded.
        Surgical intervention (prosthesis revision) may or may not be planned for the patient who
        is a candidate for this study.

        Study II: FDG-PET imaging following uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty All
        patients fulfilling the criteria below will be considered potential candidates for this
        study. Each patient must have a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease caused by
        osteoarthritis (no previous hip surgery) and have undergone primary partial or total joint
        arthroplasty by a member of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Hospital of the
        University of Pennsylvania or referring hospitals. Other causes of degenerative joint
        disease will be excluded by physical, radiographic and laboratory evaluation as clinically
        indicated. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of degenerative joint disease, and in
        order to avoid any confounding factors in experimental results that may be caused by other
        types of disorders, only this group of patients will be studied. A patient will be
        eliminated from this group at anytime if the post-operative course is complicated by any
        process that is thought to influence the outcome. Variations from an uncomplicated
        postoperative course will be determined by the operating surgeon and include clinical signs
        or other evidence to suggest infection, early loosening, or any other process directly
        involving the prosthesis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other etiologies for pain, other than for infection and aseptic
             loosening, will be excluded from enrollment into the study.
