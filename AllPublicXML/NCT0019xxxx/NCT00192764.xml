      The study hypothesis is that intensification of CHOP by dose escalation of the most active
      drugs in the combination will improve treatment outcome. Patients with diffuse large-cell
      lymphoma are treated by high cyclophosphamide containing CHOP. The planned dose is 3000 mg/m2
      which is 4 times the atandard one. Only 4 cycles are given.
