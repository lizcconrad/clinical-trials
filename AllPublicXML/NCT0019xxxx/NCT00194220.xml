      This study is only collecting specimens from current patients of PENN Fertility Care.

      The purpose of this investigation is to assess if markers of oxidative stress that are known
      to be associated with other medical conditions can be detected in women undergoing
      infertility treatment and normal women of similar age. Oxidative stress may affect a woman's
      eggs or the follicular cells that surround and nurture them. Other markers of to be
      investigated include markers of cellular aging and DNA structural changes.

      Presence of these markers will be compared in blood and urine samples taken during
      infertility treatment, and follicular fluid at the time of IVF (if applicable).
