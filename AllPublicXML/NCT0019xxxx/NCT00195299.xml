  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, exploratory, biomarker study of intravenous temsirolimus given once
      weekly for 3 weeks to newly diagnosed, advanced stage head and neck cancer subjects prior to
      beginning their standard therapy for their specific disease. The primary objective of this
      study is to identify biomarkers of temsirolimus activity.
