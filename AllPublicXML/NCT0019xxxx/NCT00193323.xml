  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized trial, we attempt to further define optimal palliative chemotherapy for
      elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer by comparing single agent treatment
      with weekly docetaxel versus combination therapy with weekly docetaxel plus gemcitabine.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

      Docetaxel Docetaxel + Gemcitabine

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (docetaxel) and 1 will receive
      treatment B (Docetaxel + Gemcitabine). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the
      doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
