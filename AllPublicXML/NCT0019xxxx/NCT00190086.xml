      Cardiac syndrome X is characterized by angina, positve stress test, and patent coronary
      angiography, and its probable mechanism is microvascular dysfunction associated with
      endothelial dysfunction. We used brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation to assess the
      endothelial function of the patients with syndrome X, coronary artery disease, and controls.
      Methods: We enrolled 28 patients with syndrome X, 11 healthy volunteers and 11 coronary
      artery disease patients. All subjects underwent a 2-step brachial artery flow-related
      vasodilation test: ultrasound artery diameter was measured at rest and after occlusion to
      assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation and after sublingual nitroglycerin to determine
      endothelium-independent condition. Serum endothelin-1 assay was performed for all
      participants. Results: The cardiac syndrome X patients had lower brachial artery dilation
      ratio (diameter after test/ diameter before test) than controls (1.10 +/- 0.09 versus 1.27
      +/- 0.11, p=0.013), but the ratio is still higher than CAD patients (1.10 +/- 0.09 versus
      1.02 +/- 0.07, p&lt;0.001). After sublingual nitroglycerin, all 50 subjects had adequate
      vasodilation. Besides, normal controls have higher endothelin-1 level than the others.

      We concluded that syndrome X patients have worse endothelial function than healthy control,
      but patients of CAD had even worse endothelium function than cardiac syndrome X patients.

      Cardiac syndrome x (CSX), which is defined as the combination of typical chest pain,
      electrocardiography or nuclear medicine evidence suggesting myocardial ischemia, and patent
      coronary arteriogram, comprises approximately 10-30% of the patients undergoing coronary
      angiogram.1,2 However, since it was first introduced in 1973, the pathogenesis of CSX has
      remained an enigma.1, 2 Among all the hypothetic explanations of CSX, including abnormal pain
      perception and non-cardiogenic origin of pain, the coronary microvascular dysfunction
      (microvascular angina), which represents reduced microvascular dilatory response and
      increased resistence, has been consistently found in CSX patients. 2, 3 This microvascular
      angina is believed to bridge the gap between the ischemic evidence and the normal-looking of
      coronary tree of CSX, and seems attributed to the endothelium dysfunction (ED), another
      frequently reported abnormality in CSX.2.3 By definition, ED is characterized by the
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) impairment, which is believed to be caused by
      decreased release of NO activity and/or activity, while the endotheliumindependent
      vasodilation (EIVD) remains preserved. 2,3,4 Therefore, it is asserted that
      endothelium-dependent dilatation of the resistance coronary arteries is defective in patients
      with CSX, and such defects may contribute to the altered regulation of myocardial perfusion
      in these patients.5 On the other hand, ED play a pivotal role in the development,
      progression, and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, as well as in the development of
      ischemia and thrombosis in the late stages of the disease, by promoting coronary
      vasoconstriction and thrombosis.4 Instead of using invasively intravascular measuring method
      used for endothelial function assessment, Celermajer et al first introduced the non-invasive
      measurement of the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of forearm brachial artery in the
      assessment of EDVD and EIVD.6 This method was reported to have good correlation to the
      invasively intravascular studies in coronary systems.4 In this study, we want to compare the
      difference of forearm FMD, which respond to specially programmed stimuli, in three patient
      groups: CSX, coronary artery disease (CAD), and normal volunteers. A two-staged stimulation
      strategy is utilized to assess the EDVD (with cuff occlusion) and EIVD (with sublingual
      nitroglycerin) consecutively. A baseline plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration is also
      checked for each patient enrolled.
