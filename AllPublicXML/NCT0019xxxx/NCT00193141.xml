  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized study, we plan to address the important question of optimum local
      treatment for patients with localized esophageal cancer. All patients will receive our
      previously studied neo-adjuvant regimen including paclitaxel, carboplatin, infusional 5-FU,
      and radiation therapy to 45 Gy. At the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy, patients will be
      randomized to undergo surgical resection, or to continue radiation to a total dose of 60 Gy,
      along with one additional course of chemotherapy.

      Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will receive neo-adjuvant therapy with:

      Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + 5-Fluorouracil + Radiation

      After neo-adjuvant therapy and restaging are completed, patients will be randomized to
      receive one of two treatments:

        -  Surgical resection (Arm A)

        -  Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation (Arm B)
