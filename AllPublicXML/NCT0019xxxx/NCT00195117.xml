      The primary objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate a novel intervention of induced
      positive affect and induced self-affirmation to increase physical activity in patients with
      asthma. At the start of the trial all patients in conjunction with their physicians will
      select a program of mild to moderate physical activity or exercise to be adopted and
      maintained on a routine basis. All patients will record perceived exertion and pedometer
      measurements in a log diary. All patients will be contacted by telephone at set time
      intervals to encourage them to continue their selected physical activity or exercise.
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will also receive induced positive affect and
      self-affirmation throughout the study period. Patients in the control arm will not receive
      the positive affect and self-affirmation components.

    <description>This group received follow-up every 2-months for one year. Follow-up included questions about their asthma and how well they had been able to engage in their doctor approved physical activity goal, which was the same as the control arm. Additionally, subjects in this arm were encouraged to use positive affect and self-affirmation techniques to motivate an increased level of participation in their physical activity goal. These subjects also received small token gifts to remind them of their participation in this study.</description>

    <description>Subjects were randomly assigned to either the control or the intervention group. The intervention included receiving an additional educational workbook about using positive affect and self affirmation, as well as participating in using positive affect and self-affirmation to motivate behavior change, which in this case was to increase their physical activity level. Patient also received small token gifts to remind them of their participation in the study and to induce positive affect. The control group also set a physical activity goal and received the same follow-up, but did not participate in the positive affect and self-affirmation portion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for this study

          -  if their physicians consider them medically able to participate, if they are 18 years
             of age or older

          -  if they have a diagnosis of mild to moderate asthma based on the NHLBI Asthma Expert
             Panel's classification system which rates symptoms, frequency of exacerbations,
             nocturnal attacks, activity restriction, use of medications, and pulmonary function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from this study for the following reasons:

          -  If they are unable to walk several blocks for whatever reason;

          -  If they have musculoskeletal or neurological deficits that preclude increased physical
             activity;

          -  If they have other pulmonary diseases;

          -  If they have cardiac disease or other severe comorbidity;

          -  If they are unable to provide informed consent because of cognitive deficits;

          -  If they refuse to participate.
