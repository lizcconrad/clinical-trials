  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II trial we attempt to improve upon the efficacy of the trastuzumab/vinorelbine
      combination by adding weekly docetaxel. When administered on a weekly schedule, docetaxel is
      well tolerated with minimal myelosuppression, so that it is likely that fully efficacious
      doses of all three drugs can be administered
