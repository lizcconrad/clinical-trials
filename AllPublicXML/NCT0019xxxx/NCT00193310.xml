  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, we plan to evaluate several novel components of therapy. In patients
      with potentially resectable stages IIB (T3N0) and IIIA we will compare weekly paclitaxel and
      carboplatin with concomitant radiation therapy versus weekly paclitaxel and every 4 week
      carboplatin in the preoperative (neoadjuvant) setting. For patients with potentially
      resectable stage IB, IIA and IIB (T2N1) tumors, weekly paclitaxel and every 4 week
      carboplatin will be given pre-operatively (neoadjuvant). The feasibility of resection will be
      evaluated in the neoadjuvant group of patients. The continued study of concurrent radiation
      therapy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin will be evaluated in those patients with stage
      IIB (T3N0) and IIIA disease who initially had resection (adjuvant setting). Lastly, weekly
      paclitaxel and carboplatin every 4 weeks will be evaluated as an adjuvant program in patients
      who had completely resected stage IB, IIA and IIB (T2N1).

      Upon determination of eligibility, neo-adjuvant patients will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment arms:

        -  ARM A Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy + Surgery

        -  ARM B Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Surgery

      After surgery neo-adjuvant patients with a complete resection will either receive Paclitaxel
      + Carboplatin or no therapy, depending on their stage of disease at time of enrollment.
      Patients with incomplete resection Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy. Adjuvant
      patients who enter the study after complete resection will receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin
      with or without Radiation Therapy based on initial stage of disease.
