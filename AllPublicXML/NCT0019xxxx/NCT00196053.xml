      Pain management has been a long-standing challenge to the medical community, specifically for
      the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic Pain is defined by the American Chronic Pain
      Association as &quot;pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an
      illness or injury or pain that goes on over months or years as a result of a chronic
      condition.&quot; Chronic pain affects the patient's quality of life, work performance and
      attendance, mental health, social interactions and overall activities of daily living.

      Implantable pumps were used for cancer and non-cancer patients, who had pain, which was
      resistant to conventional therapy. Intrathecal morphine administration is now accepted as a
      safe and effective method of controlling or reducing pain and its impact on the sufferer.

      The Codman ARCHIMEDES Implantable Constant-Flow Infusion Pump is CE marked, and has been
      commercially available in Europe for intrathecal delivery of morphine and baclofen since
      August 1997. ARCHIMEDES is intended for the treatment of chronic intractable (cancer or
      non-cancer) pain, which requires chronic intrathecal infusion of preservative-free morphine
      sulfate.

      This is a European, multicenter, prospective, single arm, observational registry conducted on
      a total of 150 Subjects at up to 10 centers in Europe.

      Subjects will be followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post Archimedes implant to assess their
      pain management and quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The Subject has been suffering from chronic (benign and/or malignant) intractable pain
             for at least 2 or more months duration (pending national laws) with a pre-implant
             value equal or more than 7 on the Visual Analog Pain Scale.

          -  The subject does not tolerate oral pain medication at the required therapeutic dose to
             treat his/her pain.

          -  The Subject has a minimum reasonable life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  The Subject has given written Informed Consent prior to enrollment into this study.

          -  The body size of the Subject is sufficient to accept the pump bulk and weight, per the
             Principal Investigator's discretion.

          -  The Subject is willing to participate in this registry for 1 year post implant and is
             willing to comply with the investigational plan requirements.

          -  It is the Principal Investigator's judgment, based on the knowledge of the Subject,
             and Subject's condition, as well as the features of the implantable system that the
             Subject is an appropriate candidate for pain management utilizing an implantable pump
             for continuously delivering preservative-free morphine sulfate via an intrathecal
             route.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The Subject has a skin condition (i.e., scleroderma, psoriasis, rash, or open wound)
             at the site chosen for implantation that would compromise the integrity or access to
             the injection port.

          -  The Subject has previously enrolled in or participated in an investigational drug or
             device trial within the preceding 4 weeks.

          -  The Subject has any known contraindication to preservative-free morphine sulfate.

          -  The Subject has a suspected or documented allergy to preservative-free morphine
             sulfate or related drugs.

          -  The Subject has a suspected or documented allergy to the materials of the infusion
             pump or catheter(s) (for example, silicone).

          -  The Subject has a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse per Principal Investigator
             discretion.

          -  The Subject is a female who is pregnant or lactating.
