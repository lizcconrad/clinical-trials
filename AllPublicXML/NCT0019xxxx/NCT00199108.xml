  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or very aggressive lymphoma and documented
      isolated CNS relapse or CNS relapse combined with other relapse sites should receive therapy
      with intrathecal DepoCyte at least once. Treatment may be repeated during induction phase
      each 2 weeks and monthly during maintenance phase. The study aim is to replace the usual 2-3
      weekly applications of intrathecal triple therapy with one application of DepoCyte. Primary
      objective is the response rate after one application of DepoCyte. Further objectives are the
      compilation of data regarding safety and toxicity
