      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of addition of IL-2 to
      pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin in HIV-HCV coinfected patients non-responders
      after three months of standard therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. IL-2
      may enhance numbers and function of CD4 T lymphocytes and specific anti-HCV immune responses
      and could participate to the control of HCV replication

      This pilot study evaluate efficacy and safety of addition of IL-2 to pegylated interferon
      alpha 2a and ribavirin in HIV-HCV coinfected patients non-responders after three months of
      standard therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin Eligible patients should
      have CD4 cells count higher than 300/mm³ if pretreated by antiretroviral therapy or higher
      than 400/mm³ if naive of antiretroviral therapy, Metavir score with histological fibrosis
      score F1, F2 or F3.

      Recombinant IL-2 will be given subcutaneously at a dose of 3 MUI twice daily for 5 days every
      8 weeks for 5 cycles from week 14 to week 46. This national multicenter study will enroll
      around 75 patients in order to give IL-2 to 20 non-responders.

      The primary endpoint is sustained virologic response, defined by undetectable serum HCV-RNA
      at week 72, six months after the end of therapy
