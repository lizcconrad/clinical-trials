    <textblock>
      The study aim to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with
      onco-peptides in combination with adjuvant cytokine can induce a measurable immune response
      in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and to evaluate the clinical effect (objective
      response rate) of the vaccination regime.

      HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; p53, survivin and
      telomerase peptides. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106 peptide/lysate
      pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week intervals. Those
      patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response after 6 injections
      will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is applied by either
      intranodal or intradermal injection near the inguinal region. For adjuvant used IL-2 2 MIU
      sc. day 2-6. Scans and re-staging tests are performed at scheduled intervals throughout the
      study.
