  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cancer vaccine research study involves the injection of the NY-ESO-1b peptide along with
      2 other agents to help stimulate the immune system. Peptides are small fragments of every
      protein. These peptides are normally found in the testis and the placenta. They have also
      been found on various types of cancer cells. The purpose is to stimulate the immune system to
      react against the peptides that are found on cancer cells

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of patients of HLA-A2 phenotype whose tumor expresses the NY-ESO-1 or
      LAGE-1 antigen. Patients will receive NY-ESO-1b peptide mixed with 0.5mL of Montanide ISA-51
      and 1mg of CpG7909 given every three weeks for four doses by subcutaneous injection. There
      will be a three-week follow-up period after the fourth injection making the cycle 13 weeks
      long. In the absence of toxicity and progressive disease, a second cycle will be offered to
      patients who have received four vaccinations.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the immune response (antibodies, CD8+ T cells, and DTH)
      and safety to vaccination with NY-ESO-1b peptide mixed with CpG 7909 and Montanide in
      patients with cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1. The secondary objective is to document
      tumor responses in patients with evaluable or measurable disease.
