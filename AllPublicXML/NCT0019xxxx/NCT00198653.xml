      This study is designed to determine domiciliary care knowledge, attitudes and practices
      regarding essential newborn care, with a focus on newborn thermal control; develop behavior
      change communications to promote prevention, early recognition and effective management of
      newborn hypothermia, evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness of education/behavior change
      communications delivered by Community Health Workers and Community Health Promoters/Change
      Agents on essential newborn care practices, including care-seeking; prevalence, recognition
      and management of hypothermia, including adaptation, safety and utility of Kangaroo Mother
      Care; and neonatal morbidity and mortality; evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      using LCT ThermoSpot device in rural communities to enhance mothers' recognition and
      management of neonatal hypothermia; determine the influence of the neonatal hypothermia
      indicator (ThermoSpot) on recognition of and response to newborn hypothermia and
      health-seeking behavior of the caregivers; develop algorithms for recognition and management
      of hypothermia to inform neonatal IMCI and verbal autopsy protocols and gain insight into the
      potential roles of various cadres of workers in providing neonatal health services at the
      community level and inform the development of models of community-based essential newborn
      care.
