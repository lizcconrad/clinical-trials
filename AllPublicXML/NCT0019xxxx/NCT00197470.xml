  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, cytokine polymorphisms are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis
      of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. We intended to clarify the association between
      polymorphisms of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the susceptibility to
      gastric cancer, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in Japan, and to detect the individuals who
      have higher risks for gastrointestinal disease development.

      H. pylori infection has close associations with the development of peptic ulcer diseases as
      well as gastric cancer, gastric adenoma, and gastric MALT lymphoma. The association of the
      host genetics with the susceptibility to various gastroduodenal disorders has been
      intensively investigated in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer by H. pylori
      infection .

      In chronic active gastritis induced by H. pylori infection, activated neutrophils and
      mononuclear cells produce several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In fact,
      levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in gastric mucosa
      infected with H. pylori.

      Cytokine polymorphisms are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      Recently, cytokine polymorphisms are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis
      of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. However, the roles of the IL-10 polymorphisms on the
      pathogenesis of H. pylori-related gastric cancer and peptic ulcer have not been fully
      elucidated.It is unclear whether pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines
      polymorphisms were associated with pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer in Japan.
      Then, we intended to clarify the association between polymorphisms of IL-10 and the
      susceptibility to gastric cancer, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in Japan, and to detect
      the individuals who have higher risks for gastrointestinal disease development.
