  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and effectiveness ibritumomab
      tiuxetan, when incorporated into combination first-line treatment for follicular lymphoma.
      Addition of the ibritumomab tiuxetan to our previously evaluated, well tolerated combination
      of rituximab and short course chemotherapy will allow the use of additional active agent with
      a unique mechanism of cytotoxicity. In addition, &quot;debulking&quot; of lymphoma prior to 90Y Zevalin
      administration may minimize the myelotoxicity of this agent.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

        -  Rituxan + CHOP or CVP + Ibritumomab Tiuxetan

      Patients who are considered medical candidates for doxorubicin should receive CHOP
      chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). Patients who are
      not considered medical candidates for doxorubicin should receive CVP chemotherapy
      (Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and prednisone)
