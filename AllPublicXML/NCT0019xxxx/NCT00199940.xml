  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if Ziprasidone is safe and effective for use in
      children and adolescents with a psychotic illness, and to determine of Ziprasidone treatment
      leads to weight changes in children.

    <textblock>
      Ziprasidone is a recently FDA approved antipsychotic, and it holds promise in the treatment
      of pediatric psychosis due to its low liability for weight gain and other side effects. This
      is important because early intervention in persons with a psychotic illness is important for
      their long-term treatment and outcome. Unfortunately, pediatric samples are often more
      sensitive to the side effects of psychotropic medications. Because psychotropic medications
      are often used by clinicians long before they are studied in pediatric populations, it is
      important to further study these agents.

      Twenty subjects with the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria,
      will be recruited for the study. If subjects have completed baseline evaluations, labs, EKG,
      and rating scales and are still eligible to participate, subjects will start on 20mg of
      Ziprasidone at night. The second week this will increase to 20 mg twice a day. At visits that
      occur at 2,4,6,and 8 weeks, the subject's dose of medication can be increased in 20mg per day
      increments. This allows for a maximum possible dose of 100mg. Dosage may be decreased at any
      time secondary to side effects.

      The potential benefits are that new information will be added to the field of pediatric
      psychiatry and the possibility that the medication may result in improved symptoms of
      psychosis. The potential benefits of this study outweigh the possible risks.
