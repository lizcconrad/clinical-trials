  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are common and important
      disorders of pregnancy. Both disorders are associated with an impairment of uteroplacental
      blood flow (UPBF). No effective therapy has been identified to reliably improve UPBF in these
      patients and typically, obstetric management involves interventional delivery, particularly
      problematic when remote from term. This study assess the hypothesis that epidural local
      anesthetics may improve UPBF in these patients.

      Women with sonographic uterine artery flow abnormalities and either PE or IUGR (or both) were
      randomized to either ACET or non ACET control. Both groups were able to receive standard
      therapies (in-hospital monitoring, magnesium and anti-hypertensives as appropriate). The
      first five days of the therapeutic arm (ACET) consisted of a dose-finding trial, where
      epidural ropivacaine infusions (10ml/hr for 24 hours) of 0•04%, 0•06%, 0•08% and 0•1% and a
      saline placebo were each administered via tunneled epidural catheters in a randomized,
      double-blinded, cross-over design over five consecutive days; all three women received all
      doses. Doppler measurement of flow in the uterine artery was performed at baseline and at the
      end of each dose period. The ideal dose for an individual was determined to be lowest dose of
      drug giving maximal effect without side effects; in the second stage of the study, this dose
      was administered until delivery with the addition of a second placebo day to during this
      period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Reliable gestational age based upon an ultrasound crown-rump length performed
             between 7 to 14 completed weeks gestation. If the ultrasound date matches the date of
             the last menstrual period (LMP) within 7 days, the LMP date is used, otherwise the
             ultrasound date is used.

             2. Gestational age at the time of enrollment between 28 to 32 weeks (based upon 1.)
             and need for in-hospital observation or treatment REGARDLESS of the study.

             3. Presence of uterine artery notching in ultrasound scan. 4. EITHER 4a or 4b (if
             both, the patient is enrolled as for 4a): 4a. Pre-eclampsia: Women must have criteria
             #1 and #2 Criterion #1: Hypertension (&gt; 140/90) at rest, measured twice, at least 6
             hours apart.

        Criterion #2: Proteinuria:

        EITHER: At least 0.1 g/l in two random samples at least 6 hours apart. OR: At least 0.3g in
        a 24 hour collection.

        4b Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR): Women must have criteria #1 and #2. Criterion
        #1: Ultrasound abdominal circumference below 10th percentile. Criterion #2: Established
        IUGR for at least 2 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  at the time of enrollment: active labor, severe pre-eclampsia, (resting blood pressure
             ≥ 160mmHg systolic or 110 diastolic, recorded on at least two occasions 6 hours
             apart), known fetal anomaly, intrauterine infection, placental anomalies (previa,
             abruption, circumvallate, infarction), twins, and refusal of consent.
