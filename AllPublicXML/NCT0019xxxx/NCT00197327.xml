  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study studies labor epidural analgesia and compares dilute (0.0625%) with concentrated
      (0.25%) bupivacaine.

      We hypothesize that patients randomize to receive the concentrated drug will require more
      drug, will have a more profound motor block, will be more likely to require instrumental
      delivery and will be less satisfied than those receiving dilute epidural drugs.

      This study examines the effect of two different local anesthetic concentrations used for
      epidural analgesia in labor. Patients are randomized to receive epidural bupivacaine, either
      as a concentrated (0.25%), or a dilute (0.0625%) solution, both administered by
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).
