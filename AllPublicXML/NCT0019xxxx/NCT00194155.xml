  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if (recurrent) cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of
      the mother results in pregnancy complications such as preterm delivery, severe preeclampsia,
      poor fetal growth, or stillbirth.

      CMV infection in adults with a normal immune system is rarely a serious event. Once a person
      has been infected with CMV, they may have recurrences (relapses) of the infection. If a
      mother is infected with the virus or relapses during pregnancy, her fetus may be at risk for
      infection. Unlike infection in adults, fetal infection may result in serious complications
      (congenital infection). The effects of fetal infection with CMV are well understood and many
      efforts have been made to potentially reduce the risk of congenital infection. However, the
      effect of CMV infection on the pregnancy itself (when the fetus is not affected by CMV) is
      less understood.

      In this study, we plan to determine if CMV recurrence in the mother results in pregnancy
      complications. The pregnancy complications listed above have been associated with poor
      placental function. We also plan to determine if (recurrent) CMV infection in the mother is
      associated with CMV infection of the placenta.

        This study will use already collected clinical samples in order to test for cytomegalovirus
        (CMV), in order to determine whether CMV is associated with pregnancy complications that
        are attributed to placental dysfunction. The subject population will include women
        diagnosed with preeclampsia, intrauterine fetal demise, intrauterine growth restriction,
        and spontaneous pre-term delivery. There will also be healthy controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who deliver at term without pregnancy complications

          -  Women who deliver (preterm, less than 37 weeks gestation) as a result of spontaneous
             preterm labor

          -  Women whose pregnancies are complicated by severe preeclampsia

          -  Women whose pregnancies are complicated by unexplained poor fetal growth (less than
             the 10th percentile).

          -  Women whose pregnancies are complicated by unexplained stillbirth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with multi-gestational pregnancies, or whose pregnancies are complicated by a
             congenital malformation or chromosomal abnormality.

          -  Women who have a medical history of hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, or
             severe renal (kidney) disease
