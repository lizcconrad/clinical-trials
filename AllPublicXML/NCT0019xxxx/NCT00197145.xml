    <measure>Average area under the curve minus Baseline (AAUCMB) of plasma HIV-1 RNA through the entire study period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the plasma HIV-1 RNA curve (AUC) was computed using the trapezoidal rule for all assessments (scheduled and unscheduled) at their actual time points. Baseline was defined as the mean of the Baseline (Day 1) and pre-treatment visit values. Participants without a Baseline assessment was removed from the analysis. The AAUCMB was computed by the AUC divided by the duration of the profile (i.e., the number of days on randomized therapy) minus the Baseline measurement.

The EQ-5D5 comprises of five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety). Each dimension comprises five levels of response (no problems, mild problems, moderate problems, moderate to extreme problems, and extreme problems).
