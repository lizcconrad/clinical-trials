        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject and subject's legal representative have voluntarily signed and dated an
             IRB-approved informed assent form and an IRB-approved informed consent form,
             respectively, before any study-specific procedures or tests are performed;

          -  The subject was randomized into Study M02-488 and either completed the study or
             prematurely discontinued due to ineffectiveness; and

          -  The subject is male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Experienced a serious adverse event in Study M02-488 which the investigator considered
             &quot;possibly&quot; or &quot;probably related&quot; to study drug; or

          -  In the investigator's opinion, long-term treatment with Depakote ER for migraine
             prophylaxis is contraindicated.

          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate to receive divalproex sodium or to participate in this study.
