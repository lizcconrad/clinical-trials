  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial compares two chemotherapy agents for the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian
      or primary peritoneal cancer in patients that have received and are no longer responding to
      Platinum based treatment. The purpose of this trial is to compare progression free survival
      between gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin. Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as
      the period from study entry until disease progression

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a documented pathologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian (FIGO
             Stage I-IV), Fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma

          -  Patients must have received platinum-based, first-line chemotherapy but no more than
             one additional prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients must have recovered from the acute
             side effects of prior chemotherapy prior to enrollment in this trial.

          -  Patients must be considered to have platinum resistant disease based on the most
             recent platinum-based regimen given, i.e., have had a treatment-free interval in
             response to platinum of less than six months, or have progressed during platinum-based
             therapy

          -  Presence of measurable disease or CA-125 &gt; or = to 100 on two separate occasions at
             least one week apart is required for this study

          -  Patient must have a Zubrod Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2

        Exclusion

          -  Patients with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant
             potential (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible. Patients with a prior diagnosis of
             a low malignant potential tumor that was surgically resected and who have subsequently
             developed invasive adenocarcinoma are eligible.

          -  Patients who are currently undergoing abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy or
             patients who have received prior abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy are excluded.

          -  Patients with unstable angina or who have had a heart attack within the past six
             months are not eligible to participate.

          -  Patients who have received prior Gemzar or Doxil therapy are ineligible.
