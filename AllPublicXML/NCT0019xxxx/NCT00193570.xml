  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will characterize the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose and
      dose-limiting toxicity of weekly bolus Topotecan when administered in combination with to
      different dosing regimens of docetaxel. We will also evaluate any anti-tumor activity of the
      combination regimen.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Paclitaxel + Carboplatin +
      Gemcitabine) and 1 will receive treatment B (Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine). The study is not
      blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

        -  Docetaxel + Topotecan

      In order to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen to progress into future phase II
      trials, two different dosing schedules of Topotecan and docetaxel will be utilized.
