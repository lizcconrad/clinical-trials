  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of combination
      therapy consisting of daily oral capecitabine and weekly intravenous vinorelbine in stage IV
      breast cancer subjects. The study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of this
      combination therapy. Safety will be assessed by analyzing the types of toxicity, the severity
      of toxicity and the need for dose modification or delay due to toxicity. Effectiveness will
      be assessed by analyzing response rates, time to treatment failure, time to progression and
      overall survival. Our hypothesis is that the regimen will be more effective than standard
      historic regimens for this type and stage of cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-agent chemotherapy is rarely curative in advanced breast cancer. Combination regimens
      are the next logical step in the attempt to improve tumor response rates and prolong
      survival. Oral capecitabine is a convenient way to deliver drug a 5-fluorouracil analogue. In
      addition, vinorelbine is a newer vinca alkaloid chemotherapeutic agent with improved efficacy
      and probably improved toxicity over its predecessors in the treatment of breast cancer. We
      propose combining these two agents. As these two drugs have non-overlapping toxicities and
      differing mechanisms of action, we anticipate being able to deliver both drugs in near full
      dose.

      Secondary purposes include assessing whether there is a correlation between intra-tumoral
      enzyme levels and prognosis.

          -  Subject must be older than 18 and younger than 85.

          -  Subject must have metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer.

          -  Subject must have pathologic confirmation of breast cancer (at least of primary
             disease). Biopsy confirmation of stage IV disease is desirable but not required.
             Tissue blocks must be available for review.

          -  Subject must have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined below:

        Measurable disease includes lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
        dimension as greater than 2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as greater than 1.0 cm
        with spiral CT scan.

        Non-measurable disease includes all other lesions (e.g. lesions less than 2.0 cm by
        conventional techniques or less than 1.0 cm by spiral CT, bone lesions, pleural effusion,
