      The purpose of this study is to analyze stored samples and data collected during the conduct
      of the study &quot;A Trial of Vitamins in HIV Progression and Transmission&quot; (HD32257). The aims
      are to examine the effect of vitamin supplementation on HIV infected women during pregnancy
      on a number of parameters in breastmilk.

        The data and samples used in this study are from HIV-infected pregnant women who
        participated in the &quot;Trial of Vitamins in HIV Transmission and Progression&quot;. Between 1995
        and 1997, 1,078 African, HIV positive women who were between gestatopm weeks 12 and 27 were
        recruited. They were followed until August 2003. This study was conducte among 771 of these
        women, for whom breast milk samples were available at delivery. There were no differences
        in baseline characteristics between this subset and the originally randomized group of
        1,069.
