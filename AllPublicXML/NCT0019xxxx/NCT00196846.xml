      Study done in young breast cancer patients to prevent chemotherapy induced ovarian failure

    <textblock>
      Study Design:

      Prospective, randomized, open phase II trial

      Schedule:

      All patients will receive an anthracycline-containing polychemotherapy.

      Patients randomized to Goserelin will receive their first injection of 3.6 mg at least 2
      weeks before start of chemotherapy. Goserelin will be given as a subcutaneous injection in
      the abdominal wall every 4 weeks (28 ± 3 days) until the end of the last chemotherapy cycle.

      Primary objective:

      •To increase the percentage of patients with normal ovarian function at 6 months after
      application of (neo)adjuvant, anthracycline-containing polychemotherapy in parallel with
      Goserelin compared to chemotherapy alone.

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare the two treatment groups regarding

        -  Compliance to treatment

        -  Toxicity

        -  Quality of life

        -  Menopausal Symptoms Score

        -  Ovarian function at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months

        -  Duration until recovery of regular menstrual period

        -  Pregnancy rate

          -  Patients request to preserve ovarian function

          -  Spontaneous and regular menstrual periods before study entry with FSH below 15 mlU/ml
