  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucomatous neuropathy is a condition that worsens with time causing atrophy of the optic
      nerve and narrowing of the visual field which may culminate in blindness. The treatment
      tested in the trial employs certain food additives intended to reverse this pathology.
