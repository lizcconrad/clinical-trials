  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether neoadjuvant intravesical Gemcitabine is
      enough active in patients with a solitary, low risk superficial bladder cancer.After
      diagnostic urethrocystoscopy or bladder sonography, all patients will receive intravesical
      gemcitabine once a week during 6 weeks. Two weeks after finishing antiblastic therapy, all
      patients will be submitted to a new cystoscopy, with TUR or cold biopsies of the site of the
      initial lesion.
