  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer may experience significant
      side effects including symptoms of intense heat, facial flushing, and sweating. These
      so-called hot flashes are similar to those experienced by women during menopause. A
      traditional Chinese herbal preparation, Dong Quai, has been used for thousands of years to
      reduce the incidence and severity of hot flashes. Anecdotal evidence exists to support the
      use of Dong Quai in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

      Recently, the awareness and use of herbal remedies and over-the-counter preparations for a
      number of different conditions have increased dramatically. This trial was, therefore,
      designed to determine if Dong Quai significantly reduces the incidence and severity of hot
      flashes in men following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prostate cancer treated with some form of androgen deprivation therapy for at least
             one month. This includes either surgical (bilateral orchidectomy) or medical (LHRH
             agonist, pure or steroidal antiandrogen or combined) castration;

          -  Greater than seven vasomotor episodes per week;

          -  Significantly bothersome symptoms associated with these vasomotor episodes, which
             produce a desire in the patient to seek treatment to reduce both their incidence and
             severity;

          -  Documented informed consent to participate in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolment in any other clinical trial or study protocol;

          -  Presence of pain due to prostate cancer;

          -  Life expectancy less than three months;

          -  Any severe concomitant condition that would make it undesirable, in the clinician's
             opinion, or the subject to participate in the trial or would jeopardize compliance
             with the trial protocol;

          -  Concomitant anticoagulation therapy or history of bleeding disorder or blood
             dyscrasia;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Dong Quai.
