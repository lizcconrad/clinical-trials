  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with
      peptides or tumor lysate in combination with adjuvant cytokines and Cyclophosphamide can
      induce a measurable immune response in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma, and to
      evaluate the clinical effect (objective response rate) of the vaccination regime.

      Eligible patients receive vaccination with tumor antigen pulsed autologous monocyte-derived
      mature dendritic cells with a fixed interval. The dendritic cells are generated from
      leukapheresis products and frozen after antigen loading.

      HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; p53, survivin and
      telomerase peptides. HLA A2 negative patients are treated with KLH and tumorlysate pulsed DC;
      autologous or allogeneic. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106
      peptide/lysate pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week
      intervals. Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response
      after 6 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is
      applied by intradermal injection near the inguinal region.

      IL-2 2 MIU s.c. day 2-6, Cyclophosphamide (Sendoxan®, Baxter A/S) 50 mg twice a day bi-weekly
      and 200 mg Celecoxib (Celebra®, Pfizer) daily are used. Scans and re-staging tests are
      performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.

    <description>DC vaccination regime consists of primary 10 intradermal injections of 1-2 weeks interval (q1w x 4 → q2w x 6). HLA-A2 positive patients are treated with p53, survivin and telomerase peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, and HLA-A2 negative patients are treated with allogeneic tumor lysate pulsed dendritic cells. 50 mg cyclophosphamide (Sendoxan®, Baxter A/S) is administered p.o. twice a day bi-weekly and 200 mg celecoxib (Celebra®, Pfizer) is given p.o. every day. From the 2nd vaccine, 2 MIU Interleukin-2 is administered s.c. on day 2-6.</description>
