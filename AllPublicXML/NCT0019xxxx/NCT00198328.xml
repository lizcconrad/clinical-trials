  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate Medpulser electroporation (EPT) with bleomycin with
      regard to local tumor recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates versus
      surgery in recurrent or secondary primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the base of the
      tongue, posterior lateral pharyngeal wall, hypopharynx or larynx.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent tumors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma usually have a poor prognosis. In
      patients suitable for salvage surgery of their recurrent disease, the success rate for local
      control has been reported to be 40-50%. The surgical treatment of H&amp;N SCC frequently results
      in significant loss of organ function (e.g., inability to swallow, speak, etc.) and/or
      permanent disfigurement. There is a compelling and unmet medical need for a local therapy
      that destroys tumors while preserving function status and appearance in patients with
      primary, recurrent, or metastatic H&amp;N SCC.

      Comparison: To compare function status at 4 months after treatment with bleomycin-EPT or
      surgery in patients with locally recurrent or second primary SCC of the base of the tongue,
      posterior lateral pharyngeal wall, hypopharynx or larynx that have failed primary curative
      therapy and in whom surgical resection is seen as an option for disease control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of SCC of the base of the tongue, posterior lateral pharyngeal wall,
             hypopharynx, or larynx must be confirmed by histological examination of a tissue
             sample (e.g., biopsy) obtained within 1 month of the patient receiving the study
             treatment.

          2. Recurrent or second primary disease in patients where surgical resection is seen as an
             option for disease control.

          3. The length of the longest diameter of the study lesion must be &lt; 5 cm and the
             calculated treatment volume must be &lt; 60.0 cm3 (tumor volume plus a 0.5 cm margin
             around the tumor) for the study lesion [where treatment volume = 0.5 (A+1) (B+1)2 and
             where A = length of the longest diameter (cm), B = the next longest diameter
             perpendicular to &quot;A&quot; (cm)].
