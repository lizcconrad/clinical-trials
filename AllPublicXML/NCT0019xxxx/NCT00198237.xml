      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy &amp; toxicity of combined
      docetaxel &amp; capecitabine as primary chemotherapy for subjects with stage II-III breast
      cancer.Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups: Docetaxel followed by four cycles
      of docetaxel &amp; capecitabine vs. capecitabine followed by four cycles of docetaxel and
      capecitabine.
