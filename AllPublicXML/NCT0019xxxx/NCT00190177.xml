      The study hypothesis is the involvement of the couple CX3CR1/CX3CL1 in occurrence of
      endothelial injury in preeclampsia. According to this hypothesis, Carriers of the I249 allele
      who express less CX3CR1 shoud be protected against this risk. The main objective of the study
      is the search of an association between CX3CR1 V249I polymorphism and preeclampsia. The
      secondary aims are the search of an association with the most severe forms of preeclampsia
      and endothelial injury.

      It is a case-control multicenter study 185 caucasian pregnant women with preeclampsia and 185
      paired controls without preeclampsia will be included.

      The frequency of the V249I polymorphism in african black population will be determined by
      studying 200 subjects (100 cases and 100 controls).

      The V249I polymorphism will be identified by PCR followed by enzyme digestion. Endothelial
      injury will be identified using three assays : von Willebrand factor, soluble VCAM-1 and
      thrombomodulin plasma levels.

      CX3CR1 involvement in preeclampsia would have potential diagnostic and therapeutic
      consequences.
