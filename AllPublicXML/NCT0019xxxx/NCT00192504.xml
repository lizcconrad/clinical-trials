        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All male or female children must have met all of the following criteria:

          -  Previously healthy

          -  Age £24 months at the time of randomization

          -  Gestational age ³36 weeks gestation

          -  Randomization within 24 hours after hospitalization

          -  Hospitalized for lower respiratory tract illness (i.e. RSV bronchiolitis and/or
             pneumonia) documented by positive RSV antigen detection or culture in respiratory
             secretions within 72 hours before randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who met any of the following criteria were not eligible for entry into the
             study:

          -  Already received or would receive ribavirin or other anti-viral treatment for the
             current episode of RSV infection prior to randomization

          -  Required intubation for ventilatory support

          -  Any medically significant underlying ongoing chronic illness or organ system
             dysfunction or other known acute illness, other than RSV infection

          -  Known renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, hematologic abnormalities, seizure or
             other neurologic disorder or immunodeficiency

          -  Requirement for supplemental oxygen at any time prior to the current RSV infection
             (brief use of oxygen in the immediate postnatal period to treat a transient condition
             was allowed)

          -  Mechanical ventilation at any time prior to the onset of the current RSV infection

          -  Congenital heart disease (children with medically or surgically corrected patent
             ductus arteriosus [PDA], small atrial septal defect [ASD] or ventricular septal defect
             [VSD] were allowed)

          -  Previous reaction to IVIG, blood products, or other foreign proteins

          -  Prior use of IVIG, RSV-IGIV (RespiGamÒ), palivizumab (SynagisÒ), or other
             immunoglobulin products within the past 2 months

          -  Currently receiving other investigational agents or have received any other
             investigational agents within the last 3 months

          -  Prior or current participation in any investigational study with a therapeutic agent
             or vaccine for RSV
