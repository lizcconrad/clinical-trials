  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine has been shown to be highly effective and well tolerated in the first and second
      line therapy, as a single agent or in combination therapy for treatment of metastatic
      transitional cell carcinoma. On the basis of Gemcitabine clinical activity and good
      tolerability this drug has been recently tested in intravesical therapy. we consider
      Gemcitabine as a good therapy candidate for patient with intermediate risk superficial
      bladder cancer. Based on the phase I/II clinical trials w are going to explore the efficacy
      and tolerability of Gemcitabine in this setting, and compare it to Mitomycin C which is
      widely used in this group of patients.
