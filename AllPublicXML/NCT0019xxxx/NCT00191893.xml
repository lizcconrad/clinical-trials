      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of 24 months of treatment with once daily
      teriparatide injection (recombinant human PTH [1-34]) 20 micrograms on bone histomorphometry
      and architecture. Patients will include postmenopausal, osteoporotic women who have been
      treated long term (at least 36 months) with alendronate, as well as postmenopausal,
      osteoporotic women who have never been treated for osteoporosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Osteoporosis: Pretreated patients currently osteoporotic or osteopenic.
             Treatment-naive patients currently osteoporotic

          -  Pretreated patients will have had at least 36 months of treatment with alendronate Na
             10 mg/day or 70 mg/week. Treatment-naive patients will have no significant
             osteoporosis treatment in the prior 36 months, as assessed by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bone metabolic diseases, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy,
             osteomalacia, any secondary causes of osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism (uncorrected),
             and intestinal malabsorption.

          -  History of malignant neoplasms in the prior 5 years, with the exception of superficial
             basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively
             treated. If malignant neoplasm was ever diagnosed, patient must presently be free of
             disease.
