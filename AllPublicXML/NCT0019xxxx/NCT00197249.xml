  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Hepatyrix when compared to the
      concomitant administration of Typherix and Havrix, and when compared to the administration of
      monovalent vaccines, Havrix or Typhim Vi. Furthermore, the study will evaluate the
      persistence of anti-Vi and anti-HAV antibodies up to 36 months after administration of the
      first dose of the study vaccine.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Written informed consent will be obtained from the subject prior to entry into the
             study.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

          -  Seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., either

             days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue
             such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series.

          -  Previous diagnosis, confirmed by a physician, of Salmonella typhi infection.

          -  History of non-response to hepatitis A and or typhoid vaccine.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered to
             persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection with
             or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., axillary temperature &lt; 99.5 °F (37.5 °C)

          -  Female planning to become pregnant during the primary study period (up Month 7).

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Planned travel to areas of high endemicity for hepatitis A and/ or typhoid fever
             during the primary study period (up Month 7).
