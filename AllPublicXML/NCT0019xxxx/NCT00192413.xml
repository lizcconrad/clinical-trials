  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the efficacy over a defined surveillance period against culture-confirmed
      influenza-illness caused by community-acquired subtypes antigenically similar to those
      contained in the vaccine, in adults aged at least 60 years at enrollment, of a single
      intranasally (IN) -administered dose of a liquid formulation of influenza virus
      vaccine,(CAIV-T) is non inferior compared with that of a single dose of commercially
      available influenza vaccine inactivated (TIV) administered intramuscularly (IM) prior to the
      anticipated commencement of the influenza season.
