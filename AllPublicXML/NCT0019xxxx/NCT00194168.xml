    <textblock>
      In an attempt to simplify the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, the researchers will
      investigate the presence of specific molecular markers of ectopic pregnancy. The
      quantification of these (and other proteins) will be performed using the Ciphergen Protein
      Chip system where serum is sampled with a high-throughput system. The patterns of these peaks
      will be compared for those with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and normal pregnancy. Later
      goals of the research will be to identify the actual proteins that correspond to the peaks
      which discriminate between the two clinical entitles. The goal is to identify a unique
      protein pattern or protein peak to distinguish a normal intrauterine pregnancy from that of
      an ectopic implanted gestation.
