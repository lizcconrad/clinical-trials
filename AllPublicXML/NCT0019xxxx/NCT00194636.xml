      The purpose of this study is to investigate, by means of a temporary sympathetic nerve block,
      the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS).
      This study may also result in a new therapeutic approach for male CPPS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male pelvic pain is a common urological complaint. Oftentimes patients are given the
      diagnosis of chronic prostatitis. Although the term &quot;chronic prostatitis&quot; is commonly
      associated with infection, less than 5% of men presenting with pelvic pain are found to have
      evidence of urogenital infection with common pathogens. Because no etiology can usually be
      associated with the pain, chronic idiopathic prostatitis is now called male chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome (CPPS). Options proposed for the treatment of male CPPS have had limited and
      variable success rates.

      Although several abnormalities of the nervous system have been proposed as possible causes of
      CPPS, the clinical nature of the disease suggests involvement of the sympathetic nervous
      system. The sympathetic nervous system may be involved in many regional pain syndromes, and
      in such situations, the term &quot;sympathetically maintained pain&quot; has been used with complex
      regional pain syndromes. Block of the sympathetic nerves supplying this region is commonly
      used to detect sympathetic nervous system involvement.

      Sympathetic nerve blocks have been used in some clinical studies involving pelvic pain but
      most of these studies included cancer patients with pelvic pain. The type of sympathetic
      blocks used for pelvic pain is superior hypogastric plexus block and it involves instillation
      of neural blocking agents such as local anesthetic agents in the region of the plexus,
      usually under fluoroscopic control. Nociceptive afferent transmission from pelvic viscera is
      probably via the superior hypogastric plexus. This treatment option has not been
      systematically used for male CPPS.

      In this study, a temporary block of the superior hypogastric plexus with bupivacaine will be
      used to assess the degree of sympathetic block with some electrodiagnostic tests. After the
      temporary nerve block, the analgesic efficacy will be monitored. Therefore, in this study, we
      hope not only to explain the sympathetic nature of the disease in more concrete terms but
      also propose a new therapeutic approach for male CPPS.

      Men with a diagnosis of non-bacterial chronic pelvic pain who have not responded to treatment
      will be asked to participate in this study. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      either active medication as the sympathetic plexus block or placebo. All other study elements
      will be identical for both groups.

      Visit 1 will take approximately 4 hours at the University of Washington Medical Center
      Urology Clinic.

        -  First, the study will be explained in detail to the subject. Any questions he has will
           be answered and he will be given the study consent to read and sign.

        -  Next, the subject will be asked to fill out baseline questionnaires. They are
           Demographic Questionnaire, Baseline Symptom Questionnaire, NIH Symptom Index-Baseline,
           AUA Symptom Score, short version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pain Drawing. A
           sexual function questionnaire, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) will
           also be administered. After completing the questionnaires, the subject will have a
           physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood draw: An 20 gauge needle will be inserted to antecubital vein and fixed with tape.
           The subject will lie down on the examination table for 20 minutes and then have
           approximately 10 cc of blood drawn, via the needle, to be used for baseline plasma
           catecholamine, corticosteroid and acetylcholine levels. Plasma catecholamine measurement
           is a biochemical parameter to evaluate sympathetic nervous system. Corticosteroids are
           stress-related hormones and acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter related to
           autonomic nervous system.

        -  We will next ask the patient to stand. After he has been standing for 5 minutes, another
           10cc of blood will be drawn then the needle removed. This blood will be used to measure
           the same hormonal parameters, as above, but after the nervous system has been activated
           by standing.

        -  Prostate massage and rectal/prostate exam: The subject will undergo a rectal and
           prostate examination with massage of the prostate and expressions of prostatic fluids.
           The subject will be asked to come with a full bladder and asked to urinate about 5 cc
           into a small container. He will then be asked to urinate 20 cc into a second container
           and save the rest in his bladder. The subject will then undergo a rectal examination and
           prostate massage and if possible obtaining expressed prostatic secretions from the tip
           of the penis. The subject will then be asked to urinate a third time approximately 10 cc
           into a sterile container. Specimens will be used for microbiologic and biochemical
           studies.

        -  Semen analysis: We will ask the subject to provide a semen sample through masturbation.
           A private room, with a lockable door, will be provided for this purpose.

        -  Some of the specimens collected at this visit will be saved for future use for possible
           biochemical studies. These studies will be available only to the investigators involved
           in this study and given to no one else. If in the future, it is deemed by the
           investigators to be scientifically and clinically valuable, these specimens may be used
           for genetic testing for genes that make one susceptible to pelvic pain syndromes such as
           prostatitis. If genetic testing is ever considered in the future, the subject will be
           contacted and asked to sign another consent form. The consent will state the exact
           nature of the testing and clearly explain why it is being done.

        -  Electrodiagnostic tests: These are the tests to evaluate the sympathetic nervous system
           tone and also sensations in several parts of the body including the genital area. The
           first electrodiagnostic test will involve a battery controlled instrument called
           Episcan. It measures the skin conductivity response on several sites of the body. We
           will apply this test on penis, scrotum, genital area, perineum, hands and feet. It is a
           painless and non-invasive test and it does not require any stimulation.

        -  The second part of the electrodiagnostic tests will involve use of another battery
           controlled instrument called Neurometer. This is a painless procedure that detects and
           localizes abnormalities of sensation in several body parts. We will apply this test on
           both feet, hands, penis, scrotum, genital area and perineum. Three different types of
           stimuli with different frequencies will be delivered to determine the sensory threshold
           in each of these areas tested.

        -  The third test will be the measurement of temperature sensations in the painful area,
           the perineum and left hand. In order to measure temperature sensation, a small probe
           capable of changing temperature will be placed on these areas. The ability to
           discriminate temperature changes will be determined as well as the subjective discomfort
           produced by the temperature changes. A computer assisted device called Thermal Sensory
           Analyzer will be used for that purpose.

        -  Then, the subject will have sympathetic skin response and evoked cavernous activity
           measurements. These tests reflect the state of the sympathetic nervous system in the
           evaluated body part. The subject will be in the supine position throughout. Two 28 ga.
           concentric needle electrodes will be placed into the side of the penis. Six surface
           electrodes will be placed on the penile skin, on scrotum, on perineum and on abdominal
           skin as recording electrodes. Eight other surface electrodes will be placed on the back
           and inner sides of both feet and both hands. After the electrodes are placed,
           spontaneous electrical activity will be recorded for 5 minutes. After obtaining
           spontaneous surface and needle electrode recordings, the right wrist (median nerve) will
           be stimulated a small amount of current. Median nerve stimulation is a routine method
           used to stimulate the nervous system in order to record electrical skin responses. After
           the stimulation of the median nerve, evoked responses will be acquired through the
           existing electrodes. The stimulus to the median nerve will be repeated.

        -  After this test, all the electrodes will be taken out and two needle electrodes as used
           in the penis will be inserted into the cremasteric muscles on both sides. These are the
           muscles surrounding the vessels that supply testicles. Then, inner side of right thigh
           will be stimulated a small amount of current to evoke cremasteric muscle reflexes. This
           reflex shows the state of sympathetic nerves that supply testicles and scrotum. These
           tests will be useful to assess the degree of sympathetic nerve blockage by comparing to
           the tests after the instillation.

        -  At the end of the visit, the subject will be given a voiding diary and plastic urinal.
           We will ask him to measure and record his urine output for any 3 consecutive days during
           the coming week.

      VISIT 2 will take approximately 4 hours at the University of Washington Medical Center
      Urology Clinic.

        -  In this visit, the subject will be taken into fluoroscopy unit in the Urology clinic.
           The subject will lie in the prone position and will receive a subcutaneous injection of
           1% lidocaine without epinephrine.

        -  Then, under radiologic guidance, two needles (22-G Chiba) will be placed via a bilateral
           posterior approach such that the tips of both needles lie anterior to the L5/S1
           vertebrae. Placement of the needle will be monitored closely in order to avoid any other
           anatomical structures. The exact locations of needles will be confirmed with injection
           of radiopaque solution (Isovue-200) under fluoroscopy. After ensuring correct needle
           placement, 0.5% levobupivacaine, 10ml will be injected in each needle in the study group
           and 0.9% NaCl solution, 10ml in the control group. Routine monitoring (ECG/blood
           pressure, pulse oximetry) will be used throughout the procedure and for 30 minutes after
           the procedure.

        -  One hour following the procedure, the blood draw, urine collection (without prostate
           massage) and the electrodiagnostic tests as in the first visit will be repeated in order
           to assess the degree of block. The subjects will be given another copy of the voiding
           diary to fill out during the next week.

      VISIT 3 will take about 4 hours and will take place one week following the procedure. The
      sympathetic blockage will be assessed for its side effects on sexual and voiding function
      with a through physical and neurological examination. The pain questionnaires NIH
      SX-Follow/up, AUA-Symptom Score, IIEF, PSS and Pain Drawing and the electrodiagnostic tests
      will be repeated.
