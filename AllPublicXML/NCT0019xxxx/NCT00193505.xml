  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Multicenter trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of
      treatment with 90Y Zevalin following a short course of salvage chemotherapy in patients with
      relapsed/refractory intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will receive:

        -  Ifosfamide + Carboplatin + Etoposide + Rituximab

      Patients showing no response to this combination regimen will receive 90Y Zevalin after two
      cycles or when progression is clearly documented. In responding patients, four cycles will be
      administered, followed by 90Y Zevalin.
