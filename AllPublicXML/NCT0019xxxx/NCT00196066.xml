      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a vascular stent to maintain an open
      iliac (leg) artery. The Zilver Vascular Stent is made of nitinol, a flexible metal with a
      long history of use in medical devices. The stent self-expands once inside the artery where
      it is intended to hold the vessel wall open. Within a few weeks, a layer of cells will grow
      over the stent helping to hold it in place.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has documented stenotic or occluded atherosclerotic lesions of the external
             iliac or common iliac artery.

          -  Patient has a de novo or restenotic lesion(s) with no prior stent in the target
             lesion.

          -  Patient has given informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is less than 50 years of age

          -  Patient is participating in another investigational drug or device study.

          -  Patient has multiple lesions (ipsilateral or in the aorta) that would require a staged
             procedure.

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel,
             nitinol, or contrast dye that cannot be adequately premedicated.

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.
