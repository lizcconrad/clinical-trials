  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemotherapy is considered to play a role in early stage non small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) .The use of preoperative Cisplatin/Gemcitabine chemotherapy has proven
      feasible and without excessive morbidity or mortality in the Phase II setting. The aim of the
      present Phase III study is to determine whether 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with
      Cisplatin/Gemcitabine improves progression free survival of NSCLC patients versus surgery
      alone. Postoperative chemotherapy will not be utilized in this Phase III trial.
