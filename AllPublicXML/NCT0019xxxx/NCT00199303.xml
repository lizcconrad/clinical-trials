  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We studied the effect of dextromethorphan (DEX), an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, on
      analgesic consumption and pain scoring after abdominal hysterectomy. Our aim was to compare
      the analgesic effectiveness and incidence of adverse side effects of oral DEX with placebo
      (P)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients were randomized to two groups. Group DEX was given 30 mg tablets of oral
      dextromethorphan with their pre-medication and three more times in the first 24 hours after
      surgery. Group P received the placebo following the same schedule. Post-operative analgesic
      requirements were assessed using a patient-controlled analgesia system.

      Pain was assessed at rest using a visual analog scale in the post anesthetic care unit(PACU),
      6 and 24 hours after surgery.
