  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influnza vaccination is highly recommended over the age of 50,but is only 50% efficatious
      among the elderly. A Vaccine given as a nasal spray may improve compliance and local
      immunity.Liposomes are lipid particles that may serve as carriers for the vaccine and
      together they enhance the local immune response in mice when given as nasal spray.This study
      aims to examine the safety and nasal and humoral responses to the nasal vaccine compared to
      the commercial muscular vaccine.
