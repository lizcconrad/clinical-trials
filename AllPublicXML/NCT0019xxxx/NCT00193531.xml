      carboplatin and etoposide, followed by maintenance therapy with weekly paclitaxel in patients
      with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. We hope to identify a &quot;standard
      treatment&quot; for this unusual group of patients who are not usually eligible for clinical
      trials.
