      The objective of the study is to evaluate the acceptance and effect of type- specific HSV
      serologic testing of pregnant women on sexual behavior at the end of pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that women with antepartum testing who are identified as susceptible
      to HSV-1 or HSV-2 will have reduced unprotected coital activity and reduced unprotected
      oral-genital activity compared to those who did not receive antepartum testing. The objective
      of the study is to evaluate the acceptance, and effect of type-specific HSV serologic testing
      of pregnant women on sexual behavior at the end of pregnancy.

      Upon enrollment, study participants will be randomized into either of two type-specific HSV
      serologic testing and counseling regimens:

        -  Group 1: Antepartum and postpartum testing. Subjects will be made aware of their
           antepartum testing results.

        -  Group 2: Antepartum blood draw and postpartum testing. Subjects' specimens will be
           tested at the same time.

      Women in group 2 will receive information about herpes infection and how to decrease their
      chance of acquiring infection during pregnancy. Subjects will be asked to keep a diary of
      sexual activity and return to the clinic every 4 weeks until delivery.
