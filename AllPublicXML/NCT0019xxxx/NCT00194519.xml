    <textblock>
      The University of Washington has received funding to conduct a proof-of-concept trial to
      assess the impact of suppression of genital herpes on HIV infectiousness. This study (the
      Partners in Prevention Study) will enroll HIV discordant heterosexual couples in which the
      HIV-infected partner is co-infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to test the
      efficacy of twice daily (bid) acyclovir (400 mg) given to the HIV-infected partner to prevent
      transmission to his/her HIV negative partner(s). This randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial will provide evidence for the efficacy of HSV-2
      suppression with daily acyclovir on HIV transmission among HIV-discordant couples among whom
      the HIV-positive partner is also HSV-2 seropositive with CD4 &gt;250. The researchers hypothesis
      is that, by decreasing the frequency and amount of genital HIV shedding, standard doses of
      daily acyclovir 400 mg bid will reduce the rate of HIV transmission by 50% in HIV-discordant
      couples among whom the HIV-infected partner is HSV-2 positive.

      Under the study protocol version 4.1.1, 3000 HIV-discordant heterosexual couples in which the
      HIV-positive partner is HSV-2 positive and has a CD4 count &gt;250 will be recruited;
      participants will be followed for up to 2 years. A 4% per year HIV incidence in the placebo
      arm is assumed.

      The first study site began enrolling participants on 17 November 2005. As of September 2006,
      14 sites in Eastern and Southern Africa had participated in recruiting the 2300
      HIV-discordant couples enrolled to date.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is the primary cause of genital ulcers and one of the
      most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Consistently, over 30 studies have
      found HSV-2 infection to be a risk factor for HIV acquisition with an overall relative risk
      of 2.1 in the studies that demonstrated HSV-2 preceded HIV infection. A recent study of
      HIV-discordant couples from Rakai, Uganda, has shown that at all levels of HIV viral load in
      the HIV-positive partner, HSV-2 infection in the susceptible partner increased the
      per-contact risk of acquisition of HIV five-fold, and GUD in the HIV-source partner increased
      the per-contact risk of HIV transmission five-fold. As strong as these epidemiological data
      are, an intervention trial is required to define the clinical and public health significance
      of these findings.

      This trial will directly answer the extent to which HSV-2 infection increases infectiousness
      of HIV/HSV-2 co-infected persons and the relative reduction in HIV transmission among HSV-2
      seropositive persons treated with daily suppressive antiviral therapy. Acyclovir has an
      acceptable safety profile for widespread STD treatment and is inexpensive, well-tolerated,
      and episodic and long-term suppressive therapy has not been associated with increased
      acyclovir resistance. Given high HSV-2 seroprevalence in HIV-infected persons (70-80%) and
      high HIV incidence in populations with high prevalence of HSV-2 infection worldwide, this
      approach could have great public health importance by providing a safe, acceptable, and
      cost-effective method to reduce HIV transmission among HIV-infected persons who are also
      HSV-2 seropositive.

      Sites that have enrolled couples in this study include: Johannesburg (2 sites) and Cape Town,
      South Africa; Gaborone, Botswana; Kitwe/Ndola and Lusaka, Zambia; Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret
      and Thika, Kenya; Moshi, Tanzania; Kampala, Uganda; and Kigali, Rwanda.

             regulations and guidelines.

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and to take
             part in the study.

          -  Part of a heterosexual couple in which one partner meets the study eligibility
