        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject and subject's legal representative have voluntarily signed and dated an
             IRB-approved informed assent form and an IRB-approved informed consent form,
             respectively, before any study-specific procedures or tests are performed.

          -  The subject was randomized into Study M01-342 and either completed the study or
             prematurely discontinued due to ineffectiveness.

          -  The subject is male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female.

          -  Subject is judged to be in general good health based upon the results of a physical
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory profile (as
             described in Section 5.3.1)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject is female, of childbearing potential, and not using an effective method of
             birth control (e.g., total sexual abstinence or contraceptives).

          -  Subject experienced a serious adverse event in Study M01-342, which the investigator
             considered &quot;possibly&quot; or &quot;probably related&quot; to study drug.

          -  Subject is violent, homicidal, or suicidal such that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, the subject is at significant imminent risk of hurting self or others.

          -  Subject has any of the following abnormal laboratory results at the last assessment
             prior to Day 1: Platelet count &lt;/= 100,000/ÂµL; ALT or AST &gt;/= 2 times Upper Limit of
             Normal (ULN)

          -  The subject is taking a protocol allowed medication for ADHD that has not been stable
             for at least 3 months prior to Day 1, is expected to require a dosage adjustment
             during the study, or that, in the investigators opinion, may be exacerbating mood
             symptoms.

          -  Subject requires treatment with or has taken a protocol-prohibited medication (see
             Appendix D) within 5 elimination half lives of Day 1.

          -  Subject has received an investigational drug, other than Depakote ER in Study M01-342,
             within 30 days prior to Day 1 of this study.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, long-term treatment with Depakote ER for the subject's
             mania associated with bipolar disorder is contraindicated.

          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate for this study.
