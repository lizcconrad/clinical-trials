      In this phase II trial, we will evaluate the weekly schedule of topotecan in the first-line
      treatment of elderly and/or poor performance status patients with extensive stage small cell
      lung cancer. Patients eligible for this trial will be those considered poor candidates for
      standard combination chemotherapy or other investigational regimens
