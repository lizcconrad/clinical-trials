      The purpose of this study is to study if sildenafil (Viagra) is effective in improving
      neuropathic pain. This will be an open label study at 3 doses of sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg and
      100 mg). If this study suggests efficacy, the information will be used to plan a placebo
      controlled, double-blind study in the future.

      Neuropathic pain is a common problem resulting from a diverse group of disorders including
      nerve injuries and neuropathies related to diabetes and other disorders. Pharmacologic agents
      are available such as gabapentin, which can successfully treat many patients. For many
      however there is inadequate treatment available, due to lack of efficacy and poor
      tolerability and the need for new pharmacologic agents is recognized.

      We propose to study if sildenafil is effective in improving neuropathic pain, in patients
      with diabetes mellitus. Our primary outcome will be a reduction in the weekly average 11
      point Likert pain scale (0 - no pain, 10 - worst possible pain) at 8 weeks. Secondary
      outcomes will include the Rand-36 quality of life scale, McGill visual analogue scale (VAS)
      and a sleep interference scale.

      This will be an open label study at 3 doses of sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg). Patients
      will begin at 25 mg at night for 1 week. If pain continues, the dose will be increased to 50
      mg at night for 1 week. If pain continues the dose will be increased to 100 mg at night.
      Subjects will be on the medication for 8 weeks. If this study suggests efficacy, the
      information will be used to plan a placebo controlled, double-blind study in the future.

             as anti-epileptic medications or tricyclic anti-depressants, however must be on a
             stable dose for 4 weeks prior to and during the study. Eligible patients must have a
             score of at least 40 on the VAS.
