    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor prolapse is a general term used to describe various clinical conditions that are
      associated with pelvic floor (muscles that support the vagina) relaxation in female
      patients.Pelvic floor prolapse is thought to result from a stretching, weakening or tearing
      of the soft tissue structures that support the pelvic organs. These tissues become
      compromised because of a weakened or damaged.The purpose of the study will be to demonstrate
      the usability of Polypropylene Mesh for prolapse repair, using the TVM technique.
