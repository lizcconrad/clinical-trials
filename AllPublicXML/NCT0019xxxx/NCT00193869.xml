    <textblock>
      The study aimed to pilot the viability of a full scale randomised comparison of 2 steroid
      doses in malignant spinal cord compression, to establish safety of high dose dexamethasone in
      this setting in Australia, to test web registration and randomisation and to compare
      different functional outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) is an uncommon condition with an estimated annual
      incidence of 2.5 per 100,000. It is a dreaded complication of malignancy because of the
      severe impact paralysis and sphincter disturbance has on quality and duration of survival.

      Rat models have demonstrated the effectiveness of high doses of steroids. Only three
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published. The first compared radiotherapy to
      laminectomy plus radiotherapy in a series of 29 patients and failed to show any significant
      differences The widespread commonly used dose of Dexamethasone in Australia at that time was
      16 mg/24 hr and the main concern for implementing higher doses was the toxicity profile
      reported in the few small randomised comparisons available at the time.In view of the
      conflict between standard Australian practice versus published (overseas) guidelines, a
      randomised comparison was proposed in Australia. This study was a pilot study initiated to
      determine the viability of a large trial, to pilot the use of web technology for trial
      conduct and to determine clinically useful outcome measures apart from simple ambulation
      rates.

      Comparisons: Patients randomised to receive either 16mg/24hr or 96mg/24hr dexamethasone.
