      The purpose of this study is to learn about lower respiratory tract and bloodstream diseases
      among infants born to HIV positive mothers in Botswana. Study factors include how commonly
      infants get these diseases, the causes, and outcomes. The study will also try to measure the
      protective effect, if any, of breast feeding on respiratory disease illness and deaths.
