  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epirubicin/docetaxel combination is one of the most active and best tolerated
      taxane/anthracycline combinations. In this phase II trial, we will further evaluate the
      feasibility, safety and effectiveness of the docetaxel/epirubicin combination, when
      administered as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.

      Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will receive:

      Docetaxel + Epirubicin
