  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized study which compares two different regimens of chemotherapy.
      The purpose of the study is to determine which of the two regimens will make the tumor
      smaller or disappear, and for how long. In addition the disease-related symptoms will be
      evaluated. The safety of the drugs will be determined based upon evaluation of the side
      effects
