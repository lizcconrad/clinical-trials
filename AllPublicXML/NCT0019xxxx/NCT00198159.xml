  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of ZD1839 in the treatment of subjects with refractory germ
      cell tumors. Subjects will take ZD1839 for one year in the absence of excessive toxicity or
      decision to withdraw.

      The primary objective is to determine the response rate of ZD1839 in patients with refractory
      germ cell tumors expressing EGFR. The secondary objectives are to determine the duration of
      response, time to progression and overall survival in patients with refractory germ cell
      tumors expressing EGFR and treated with ZD1839; to evaluate the tolerability of ZD1839 in
      patients with refractory germ cell tumors and to correlate tumor response to degree of EGFR
      expression by immunohistochemistry.
