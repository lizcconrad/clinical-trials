  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if hyaluronan, an injectable medication for knee
      arthritis, also works for arthritis at the base of the thumb. This study will also evaluate
      how good ultrasound is at visualizing medication in the thumb joint. We are no longer
      recruiting for this part of the open label trial.

    <description>The DASH Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any of several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with a higher value indicating greater disability. The change in DASH (delta) over those 6 months was recorded.</description>

      <population>The average baseline VAS for pain was 62(range 38-100), and DASH was 29.7 (range 1- 68). 53% had ≥ 1 previous corticosteroid injection. All patients had moderate or severe radiographic OA of the CMC joint: 59% were K+L Grade 4, 25% Grade 3, and 16% Grade 2. No patients had clinical evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome or DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis.</population>
