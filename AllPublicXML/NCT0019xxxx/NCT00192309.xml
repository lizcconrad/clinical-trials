  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to perform a variety of assays on blood, serum, nasal
      wash and cell samples obtained from healthy adult subjects for the purposes of developing
      assays for application in the further investigation of immune responses generated by
      influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A &amp; B, live, cold-adapted (liquid formulation
      CAIV-T; Wyeth, Marietta, PA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, outpatient study carried out in
      healthy adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age. The study was designed to evaluate the kinetics of
      the immune responses generated by each of the study products in order to determine the best
      sampling time for future studies. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a
      single dose of either CAIV-T, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV), or placebo.

    <description>Liquid CAIV-T vaccine for this study consisted of three cold-adapted, attenuated, reassortant strains representing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens of the A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and B/Yamanashi/166/98 influenza virus strains. The reassortant vaccine strains were grown in specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs and the allantoic fluid, which contained virus, was harvested, concentrated and purified. Each dose of CAIV-T used in this study was formulated to contain approximately 107 FFU of each of the 6:2 influenza reassortant vaccine strains.</description>
