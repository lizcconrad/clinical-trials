    <textblock>
      Patients who were previously enrolled on the LY353381 arm of any LY353381 oncology trial
      could enroll in this &quot;roll-over&quot; study if they had exhibited clinical benefit from treatment
      and wished to continue on treatment. Patients were monitored for safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a clinical trial of LY353381 that has met its main safety and
             efficacy objectives, and could otherwise close.

          -  Evidence of continuing benefit with LY353381 (eg. complete response, partial response
             or stable disease with no symptomatic or clinical evidence of disease progression).

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve, liver and renal function, consistent with the previous
             LY353381 protocol, with no recent significant deterioration or metabolic condition
             that could affect patient safety or compliance with the protocol (eg, hypercalcemia).

          -  Written informed consent from patient.

          -  Childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, menopause, or
             attenuated by use of an intra-uterine contraceptive device or barrier method during
             and for 3 months after the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No concurrent systemic therapy (immunotherapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy) for
             cancer. Palliative radiotherapy is allowed (eg, for pain) as long as there is no
             evidence of disease progression. Investigational agents, other than LY353381, within
             the 4 weeks prior to this study enrollment and other SERMs are also not permitted.

          -  No concurrent use of oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists, or coumarin (warfarin).

          -  No serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the
             discretion of investigator), including predisposition to thromboembolic disorder.

          -  Must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Must not have a gap in treatment of more than 4 weeks between previous LY353381 study
             and enrollment in current study.
