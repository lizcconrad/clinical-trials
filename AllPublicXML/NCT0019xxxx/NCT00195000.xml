    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how safe and effective the combination of Mylotarg
      in combination with cytarabine is in treating patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with cytarabine
      in inducing complete remission in patients with AML and advanced MDS over the age of 60
      years.

      Patients eligible for treatment will receive the following:

      Mylotarg at 6 mg/m2 on day 1 as a 2 hour intravenous infusion

      Cytarabine at 100 mg/m2/day as a continuous intravenous infusion daily for 7 days
