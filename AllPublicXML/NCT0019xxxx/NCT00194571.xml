      This is a 6-state randomized controlled trial (RCT) that uses a behavioral intervention to
      enhance parenting skills for school age children when a mother is recently diagnosed with
      early stage breast cancer. Efficacy analyses will include measures of the child's and
      mother's psychosocial adjustment, including enhanced parenting quality and skills related to
      the cancer.

      This is a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial of recently diagnosed mothers with local or
      regional breast cancer and their school age child. After baseline measures are taken, mothers
      are randomized into either intervention and control group. Intervention participants are
      given 5, 1-hour at home educational counseling sessions by a specially trained nurse. Control
      participants are mailed an educational booklet whose content focuses on supportive parenting
      behaviors that are part of the face to face sessions given to the experimental group.

      The theoretical framework for the study derives from Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, a
      contextual model of parenting, and stress and coping theory. Efficacy is evaluated through
      standardized valid and reliable questionnaires of psychosocial functioning in the mother
      (affect, mood, self-efficacy) and psychosocial functioning in the child (cognitive-emotional
      functioning, including behavioral problems, anxiety, depressed mood, and cancer-related
      concerns). Primary study hypotheses will be evaluated comparing pre-posttest measures of the
      intervention compared to controls at post-test and 1-year follow up.
