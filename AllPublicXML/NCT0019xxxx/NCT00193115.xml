  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of dose-dense docetaxel followed by
      doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with support given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of
      women with node positive and high risk breast cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will receive:

      Neoadjuvant Docetaxel + Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide + Surgery

      Adjuvant patients will enter the study after surgery and receive Docetaxel+ Doxorubicin +
      Cyclophosphamide. Patients treated with lumpectomy will undergo postoperative radiation
      therapy after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone
      receptors will begin anti-estrogen therapy after the last course of chemotherapy.
