  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that a 4 week treatment with atomoxetine is more effective than
      placebo in patients with combined type Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
      patients with only Reading Disorder, and patients with combined type ADHD and Reading
      Disorder.

    <measure>Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) as Derived From the Stop Signal Reaction Time Paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of initial therapy and Week 4 of crossover therapy</time_frame>
    <description>SSRT measures response execution (go trials) and response inhibition (stop trials). Go trials consist of stimulus (airplane). Child to press response button corresponding to direction airplane is pointing. Stop trials consist of go trial and audible stop signal. Initial delay between go trial and stop signal = 250 msec. If child succeeded in inhibiting response, delay on next stop trial increased by 50 msec, otherwise, delay decreased by 50 msec. SSRT = subtract mean delay from mean go signal reaction time. Lower scores mean better ability to suppress response when presented with stop signal.</description>

    <description>Measure of reaction time to identify whether a word displayed on a computer is a real or correct word versus a pseudo word. During the performance of the lexical decision task that was presented on a computer, the reaction times and accuracy of responses were measured. Data presented are the mean reaction times over the 4 weeks of each therapy for identifying correct words correctly.</description>

    <description>Measures the 18 symptoms contained in the DSM-IV diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Individual item scores range from 0 (none/never or rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total score is computed as the sum of the scores on each of the 18 items. Total score is the sum of the scores on the 18 items and range from 0 to 54. Total T-score = (Total Score - 50)/10. Total T-score ranges from -5 (low severity) to 0.4 (high severity).</description>

        <description>SSRT measures response execution (go trials) and response inhibition (stop trials). Go trials consist of stimulus (airplane). Child to press response button corresponding to direction airplane is pointing. Stop trials consist of go trial and audible stop signal. Initial delay between go trial and stop signal = 250 msec. If child succeeded in inhibiting response, delay on next stop trial increased by 50 msec, otherwise, delay decreased by 50 msec. SSRT = subtract mean delay from mean go signal reaction time. Lower scores mean better ability to suppress response when presented with stop signal.</description>

If child succeeded in inhibiting response, delay on next stop trial increased by 50 msec, otherwise, delay decreased by 50 msec. SSRT = subtract mean delay from mean go signal reaction time.

          <description>Measure of reaction time to identify whether a word displayed on a computer is a pseudo word versus a real or correct word. During the performance of the lexical decision task that was presented on a computer, the reaction times and accuracy of responses were measured. Data presented are the mean reaction times over the 4 weeks of each therapy for identifying pseudo words correctly.</description>
