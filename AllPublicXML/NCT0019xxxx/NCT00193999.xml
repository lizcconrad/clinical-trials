  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric emptying is delayed after cardiac surgery, but the efficacy of the nasogastric (NG)
      tube in preventing distension and reducing vomiting is unclear. Nasogastric (NG) tubes are
      routinely used in patients undergoing surgery. They are presumed to reduce postoperative
      nausea and vomiting (PONV) and to lessen the risk of aspiration by reducing residual gastric
      volumes; however, their insertion and use is not however without potentially serious
      complications. Existing literature does not address their efficacy in reducing PONV after
      cardiac surgery. However, current evidence suggests that up to 50% of patients in this group
      suffer significant nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study is to determine whether
      NG tubes should continue to be inserted routinely during cardiac surgery to reduce PONV.
