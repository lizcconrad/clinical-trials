      Inpatient Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Open-Label Olanzapine Monotherapy in
      Treatment Refractory Bipolar Mania: This study recruits adult subjects who are diagnosed with
      Bipolar I Disorder and presently experiencing an episode of mania. Patients must be willing
      to spend initial 7 days in the hospital to observe response to medication. Patients must be
      refractory (intolerant or non-responsive) to treatment with lithium and valproate or
      carbamazepine. Patients receive study-related care at no cost. This study is sponsored by Eli
      Lilly and Company.
