             atrial or ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus) that is judged to be
             hemodynamically significant, and/or

          -  Be less than or equal to 24 months of age with CLD of prematurity (BPD) requiring

             respiratory infection); admission must occur between October 1 and June 30 for
             northern hemisphere sites, and between March 1 and November 30 for southern hemisphere
             sites.

          -  Study enrollment within 2 days after hospitalization.
