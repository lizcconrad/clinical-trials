  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 7.2% NaCl in 6% hydroxyethyl starch will
      lower intracranial pressure (ICP) in SAH-patients with normal or moderately elevated ICP in a
      placebo controlled study, and to describe the haemodynamic effects.

    <textblock>
      In the acute phase after a SAH, many patients need intensive care treatment to control the
      development of fatally increased intracranial pressure. One type of treatment used is
      osmotherapy. Traditionally mannitol has been the preferred drug, but the use of hypertonic
      saline solutions has gained more and more acceptance. The immediate effect seems to be
      equivalent or better than with mannitol, and there seem to be less adverse effects, such as
      hypovolemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, and rebound increase of ICP.

      Most clinical studies in patients with life-threatening increase in ICP are observational,
      and show a predictable effect of hypertonic saline. We wanted to strengthen our own findings
      from such a study by applying the same study model but with a placebo control group in
      patients with only moderately elevated ICP.

      We also wanted to document the haemodynamic effects, measuring cardiac output, intrathorasic
      blood volume and extravascular lung water.
