  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II study that will evaluate the activity of gemcitabine as intravesical therapy on the
      marker lesion in superficial bladder carcinoma at intermediate risk. Primary objective is the
      evaluation of the pathological complete response after 8 instillation of gemcitabine. 46
      patients are requested.
