  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After approval of amendment (g), patients who were still receiving study drug at the time
      were scheduled for a study visit. In addition, patients who had discontinued early from the
      core, blinded phase of the study were contacted.

      All of these patients were offered the opportunity to enter the unblinded extension phase (if
      they met eligibility criteria) and continue somatropin treatment (regardless of initial
      treatment randomization) until they reached final height.
