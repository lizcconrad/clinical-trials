  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis remains a limiting factor in in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
      patients treated with chemoradiation leading to pain, dysphagia, and weight loss. Low-level
      laser therapy emerges as a promising, preventive therapy of chemoradiation-induced OM. This
      study was designed to assess the efficacy of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in reducing the
      incidence and/or severity of oral mucositis.

      Assuming oral mucositis grade 3 for placebo 0.4 (P0); laser group 0.15 (P1) ; β=0.2; α=0.05,
      sample size was 94 pts. From Jun 2007 to Dec 2010, 47 laser group and 47 placebo patients
      bearer of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas of nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx
      entered a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial.
      chemoradiotherapy consisted of conventional radiotherapy 70.2 Gray (Gy) (1.8Gy/d, 5 times/wk)
      + concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the incidence of
      grade 3-4 oral mucositis. The Low-level laser therapy used daily, was a diode indium
      phosphide, gallium and aluminum (InGaAlP), 660nm-100 milliwatts (mW)-4 Joules (J)/cm²(DMC,
      São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil). Oral mucositis evaluation was done by WHO and Oral Mucositis
      Assessment Scale (OMAS) scale.

            <groups_desc>The primary end point of the study was the incidence of grade 3–4 oral mucositis (OM) according to the WHO scale. Assuming an α =0.05 and a β = 0.20, with the estimates of proportion being 0.40 for placebo (P0) and 0.15 for LLLT (P1) a total of 94 patients were evaluated. One-sided test error was the basis for the sample size determination and all the reported P-values were derived from two-sided statistical tests. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</groups_desc>
