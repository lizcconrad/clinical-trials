  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate
      interactions between the sensory system and the motor cortex in primary generalized dystonia
      (DYT1 dystonia) subjects who undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.

      The sensory system is the body's sense organs - smell, sight, sound, etc. - and the motor
      cortex is the part of your brain where nerve impulses control voluntary muscle activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of DYT1 dystonia is not clear. DYT1 dystonia symptoms include abnormal posture or
      repetitive twisting movements affecting one body part; in some patients, the entire body can
      twist and contort painfully. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are normally used to
      evaluate changes in brain structure in DYT1 dystonia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      is a painless, non-invasive method to test how your brain conducts electrical messages to the
      rest of your body, including your muscles.

      If you are a DYT1 dystonia patient, then this study involves up to three visits. The first
      visit (before DBS surgery) will last about 4 hours and the second and third visits (after DBS
      surgery) will last about 4 hours as well. These visits will include a complete physical and
      neurological exam, video recorded dystonia and mood rating scales, followed by
      electromyography (EMG) and TMS sessions. Subjects who have already undergone DBS surgery may
      participate in applicable visits based on the length of time since their DBS surgery.

      If you are a control subject, this study involves one visit, about 4 hours long. This visit
      will include TMS and EMG sessions.

    <description>Surface electromyography (EMG) will be recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle to determine the amplitude of potentials evoked in two ways - SAI and SAIdualstim. For SAI, potentials will be evoked with median nerve stimulation preceding TMS by the N20 latency plus 3 ms. For SAI dualstim, simultaneous stimulation of median and ulnar nerves will precede TMS by the N20 latency plus 3 ms.</description>

        Subjects scheduled to undergo pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery for DYT1 dystonia
        will be enrolled up to 12 months for this pilot trial. Genetic test results confirming DYT1
        gene mutation will be reviewed prior to consenting research subjects. Patients who are
        diagnosed with DYT1 dystonia and are candidates for DBS surgery will be indentified as
        candidates for the research study. Additionally, subjects who have already undergone DBS
        surgery will be identified as candidates.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Between the ages of 10 and 80 years. (CONTROL SUBJECTS between 18-80 years)

          -  Diagnosis and genetic test results confirming diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia.

          -  Currently treated with medications and enrolled in evaluation process for DBS surgery
             to confirm candidacy - OR -

          -  Previous DBS surgery

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Implanted pacemaker, medication pump, vagal stimulator, Transcutaneous electrical
             nerve stimulation (TENS) unit or ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

          -  Family or personal history of medication refractory epilepsy.

          -  Pregnancy: due to the frequent visits over a prolonged period and the lack of
             Information on the safety of TMS during pregnancy, pregnant women will not be eligible
             to participate in this study. Women of childbearing potential will be eligible to
             participate, provided that they are using adequate contraception during TMS
             treatments.

        This study is accepting healthy volunteers, aged 18-80, as control subjects. Control
        subjects will not undergo DBS surgery.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (as it applies to healthy control subjects):

          -  Cannot have family history or personal history of medication refractory epilepsy
