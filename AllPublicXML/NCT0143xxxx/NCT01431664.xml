      RATIONALE: AT9283 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/IIa clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of AT9283
      in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase IIb dose of multikinase
           inhibitor AT9283 in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  To document evidence of efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in plasma in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To assess target kinase inhibition by multikinase inhibitor AT9283 in these patients.

        -  To identify potential predictive molecular biomarkers in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive multikinase inhibitor AT9283 IV continuously over 72 hours. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days* for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving benefit of treatment may continue for up to 6 more courses at
      the discretion of the chief/principal investigator.

      NOTE: *Course length may be extended to a maximum 42 days to allow for recovery of blood
      counts. Intrathecal therapy is permitted from course 2 onwards in patients with ALL.

      Blood specimens are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies including
      molecular predictive biomarkers and ex vivo and in vivo measurement of kinase inhibition
      assessments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 42 days or until recovery
      of blood counts (whichever is the sooner).
