    <textblock>
      Enbrel was first approved as new medicine on 06 Oct 2003 in Korea and the indication of
      Pediatric Psoriasis was approved on 23 Sep 2009. However, as required for any new indication
      approved by Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA), safety and efficacy information of new
      indication should be provided at minimum 600 subjects administered in the setting of routine
      practice during the initial 4 years after new indication approved.
