    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to compare standard of care invasive methods to an FDA
      approved non-invasive device and a novel wireless non-invasive device, both manufactured by
      Non-Invasive Medical Technologies Inc., with the goal of correlating the data generated by
      the novel device to the measurements taken by the standard of care invasive monitors.
