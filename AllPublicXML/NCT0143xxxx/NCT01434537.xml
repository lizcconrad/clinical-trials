      Evaluation of the AccuVein ® AV 300 vein scanner in clinical routine in a pediatric operation
      room setting for a 4 weeks period. Assessment of usability, anonymous clinical register of
      every venepuncture(age, gender, size, weight, punction site, number of attempts, time until
      successful cannulation, local anaesthesia, general anaesthesia, pain scales: faces pain scale
      und BPS/BPOS).

    <textblock>
      For application of drugs and liquids a peripheral venous access is necessary in
      anaesthesiological procedures.The peripheral venepuncture is a painful procedure and induces
      a higher level of perioperative stress in children.

      The punction of peripheral veins in children can be made difficult by the often distinctive
      amount of subcutaneous fat or other medical conditions.

      The AccuVein ® AV300 vein scanner is a contactless, laser-driven device made for facilitate
      the search for peripheral veins up to a depth of 7mm. This could lead to a minimization of
      time until successful puncture and smaller number of failures.
