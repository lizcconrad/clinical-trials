      This is an observational, non-randomised trial to evaluate the effect of dietary type on
      infants oral candida colonization the investigators evaluated 90 infants in 1-24 months (45
      breastfeeding and 45 bottle feeding infants) who attended to Yazd clinic for regular
      pediatric appointment. Infants with unremarkable health histories, normal weight, free of
      sign or symptom of oral candidiasis or other mucosal disease. Their mothers were also healthy
      and without sign or symptom of vagina or mammary candidiasis. Pacifier usage, use of
      antibiotics in last months, sign or symptom of oral candidiasis in infants or vagina and
      mammary candidiasis in mothers were exclusion criteria.

      After filling in a questionnaire about infants dietary intake, age and sex and their mothers
      education level and health condition, a pre-moistened sterile cotton swab was taken from
      dorsal surface of tongue and mid-plate. The swabs were cultured in agar plate containing
      sabourauds dextrose agar medium with chloramphenicol, and kept in 37 C for 48 hours. The
      number of candida colonies was counted and germ tube test performed to separate candida
      albicans from other types. The data was collected and analyzed by SPSS software and
      chi-square, logistic regression and mann-whitney test. Study hypothesis: feeding by mothers
      milk reduces oral candida colonization.
