  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there is no clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of Glucosanol in
      maintaining weight loss beyond the study duration of 12 weeks. The rationale for this
      open-label study is to assess the efficacy in preventing regain of loss body weight and
      safety of Glucosanol in subjects who are overweight or obese over a longer period after the
      initial weight loss.
