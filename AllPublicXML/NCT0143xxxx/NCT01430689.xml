  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Vaccine Development - Mali is interested in learning if vaccinating a pregnant
      woman against influenza will protect her infant against this disease. The investigators know
      that influenza infection, the &quot;flu&quot;, affects pregnant women and their infants in Mali. The
      illness known as flu is caused by a germ (virus) that is passed easily among people. The flu
      causes symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and body aches. Certain groups
      of people, such as pregnant women and infants, are at risk for having severe disease when
      they get the flu. Vaccination against influenza is not routinely available to pregnant women
      in Mali although it is recommended.

      Women who wish to participate will have 5 visits to the clinic and weekly visits to the home
      to follow the health of the woman and her infant when it is born. The investigators will also
      ask permission to make weekly visits to all children under 5 years of age to follow their
      health as it relates to influenza infection.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled observer-blind trial measuring the efficacy,
      safety and immunogenicity of TIV and the safety and immunogenicity of MCV in pregnant women
      and their infants up to 6 months of age. Women will be recruited in the 3rd trimester of
      pregnancy and vaccinated with either TIV or MCV. Safety assessments of the women will be
      completed 30 minutes and 1 week after vaccination, at delivery and 3 and 6 months after
      delivery. Safety assessments of the infants will be completed at birth and at 3 and 6 months
      of age. Immunogenicity assessments will include blood sampling of women immediately prior to
      vaccination, 4 weeks post-vaccination, at delivery and 3 and 6 months after delivery; infants
      will have cord blood collected at birth and peripheral blood collections at 3 and 6 months of
      age. Visits to ascertain the costs related to ILI and LCI will also be conducted. The
      majority of activities conducted in this trial are related to efficacy assessments which will
      continue until the newborn infant is 6 months of age. We will be conducting case detection
      for LCI via weekly household visits. In addition, hospital-based surveillance for
      meningococcal disease will be conducted to measure the efficacy of MCV.
