  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year multi-centre, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      hypothesis that wheelchair skills training (using a systematic training program called the
      Wheelchair Skills Training Program) improves wheelchair skills and safety of 144 powered
      wheelchair users. A second objective is to assess the effects of age, sex, training centre,
      and participant experience on outcomes, assessing the retention of benefits and assessing the
      impact of training on other important outcomes.
