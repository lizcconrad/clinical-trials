      To demonstrate superiority of OXN PR compared to placebo with respect to analgesic efficacy
      in subjects with chronic severe pain associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), as assessed by
      averaged 24 hour pain scores collected for 7 days prior to the clinic visits

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain management in PD is a recognised unmet need. Estimates of incidence vary in the
      literature from 29% to 83%. The types and sources of pain experienced by PD patients vary and
      include: musculoskeletal pain, PD related chronic pain, fluctuation-related pain, nocturnal
      pain, coat-hanger pain, oro-facial pain and peripheral limb or abdominal pain (also including
      drug-induced pain). Whilst modifications to dosing of dopaminergic therapy represents the
      most common method of controlling some of these pain symptoms, this must be balanced against
      the worsening of side effects of increased doses of this treatment type.

      Oxycodone hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate combined oral prolonged release
      tablets (OXN PR), is the investigational product to be used in this study. OXN PR is a
      prolonged release tablet consisting of oxycodone and naloxone in a 2:1 ratio. Due to the
      local competitive antagonism of the opioid receptor-mediated oxycodone effect by naloxone in
      the gut, naloxone reduces opioid-associated bowel dysfunction.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether effective pain control for the treatment
      of PD associated pain may be achieved with OXN PR. The secondary considerations for this
      study are to examine whether OXN PR may offer any additional benefits to the patients Quality
      of Life or symptoms of PD. If effective pain relief can be achieved with an analgesic without
      the side effects described in above, this could reduce the need to increase the dose of
      dopaminergic medications to manage pain, and therefore reduce the negative side effects of
      dopaminergic therapy described above. Given the prevalence of constipation in this patient
      population the bowel sparing effects of the OXN PR combination treatment may provide an
      ethical rationale for its use over that of other opioids.
