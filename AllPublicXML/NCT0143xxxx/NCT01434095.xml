  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A half-dose photodynamic therapy, a relative new treatment, has been widely performed to
      treat central serous chorioretinopathy.

      The researchers aimed to investigate whether the therapy improved the patient's visual acuity
      as well as the retinal sensitivity. The researchers also investigate which clinical factors,
      if any, were associated with the results; visual acuity or retinal sensitivity after the
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), macular sensitivity, and fixation stability were
      evaluated at the baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the half-dose photodynamic
      therapy. The macular sensitivity and fixation stability were determined by MP-1
      microperimetry (Nidek, Vigonza, Italy). The researchers analysed whether the BCVA and retinal
      sensitivity significantly improved or not. And if yes, the researchers were interested at
      which period after treatment the significant improvement was found. Also, the researchers
      investigated which improved first, BCVA or retinal sensitivity.

    <description>photodynamic therapy (PDT) was performed using 3 mg/m2 body surface area of verteporfin (Visudyne, Novartis AG, BÃ¼lach, Switzerland) which is one-half the conventional dose of verteporfin. The verteporfin was infused over a 10 minute period followed by the delivery of 50 J/cm2 from a 689-nm laser system (Carl Zeiss, Dublin, CA) over an 83-second exposure time.</description>
