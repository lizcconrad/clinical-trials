  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the Calmer is more effective at managing acute pain in
      preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care than the current standard of care in the unit.

      Hypothesis: While receiving treatment with Calmer, infants will show lower behavioral pain
      scores and lower heart rates, and more stable autonomic regulation as measured by heart rate
      variability indices, than infants given a soother plus facilitated tucking (standard of care)
      during routine blood collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 infants will be randomized to either receive the standard of care or the Calmer during a
      routine blood collection.

It is being tested to see if it mimics Kangaroo care, maternal skin to skin, to help promote better health outcomes. Infants would be placed on it prior, during and after bloodwork to see if it elicits a favorable response.</description>

             the assessment

          -  History of maternal abuse of controlled drugs and substances; blood collection that
             occurs beyond the 35th completed week (35 weeks + 6 days) GA

          -  Small for GA defined as a birth weight at least 2 standard deviations below mean for
             GA

          -  Higher order multiples (e.g. triplets)
