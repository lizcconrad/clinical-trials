  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was aimed to prospectively evaluate the acceptance rate of unsedated colonoscopy,
      in a setting where routine sedation for colonoscopy is standard practice and to characterize
      the subset of patients willing to try and potentially completing an unsedated procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were offered to undergo colonoscopy without routine premedication. In case of both
      acceptance and refusal, a brief questionnaire recording demographics (gender, age, level of
      education) and clinical features was prospectively recorded in a standard data sheet by one
      of the four endoscopists at enrollment. Clinical features recorded for each patient included:
      indication to the procedure, history of abdominal surgery or irritable bowel syndrome,
      presence of pain as main symptom, chronic use of sedative medications, level of patient's
      anxiety (none, mild, moderate or severe), main concern about the examination and reason for
      willing to attempt unsedated procedure.
