    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the effects of inhaled Iloprost in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to
      COPD. The main objective is to investigate the effect of iloprost on exercise endurance time
      during constant work rate cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Other efficacy and safety
      endpoints will additionally be analyzed.

        <population>The study was prematurely terminated as after 1 year it was not possible to identify a suitable number of patients who satisfied the selection criteria. Only 2 patients were randomized prior to the termination of the study, and 1 patient received a single dose of active treatment.
