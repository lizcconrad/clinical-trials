  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to train currently major depressed patients on fundamental
      aspects of working memory while the investigators administer transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during these training
      sessions. This working memory training would be performed using adaptive Paced Auditory
      Serial Addition Tasks (PASAT). The effects after two weeks of working memory training
      combined with tDCS or sham placebo (10 sessions) will be measured on different variables,
      each measured at the start and at the end of the two weeks of training. The investigators
      expect the greatest anti depressant results and cognitive enhancements in the group of
      depressed patients that received tDCS combined with working memory training.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the score of HDRS-24 scale after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>follow-up measure</measure>
    <time_frame>after two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two weeks after each participant finished his/her treatment, the investigators will contact them to verify whether treatment induces long-lasting effects. This contact will be established via email and we will ask them to fill in the same self report questionnaires as they filled in during the study protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Internal Shift Task</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Internal Shift Task (IST), an emotional attention paradigm, will be administered to measure the ability to switch attention between emotional and non emotional items in working memory. After 10 sessions of tDCS in combination with the working memory training, the investigators expect a transfer effect on an increased switching ability between emotional stimuli.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory task in combination with pupil dilatation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This task will be administered to measure participants' ability to manipulate emotional information in working memory: either reverse or maintain in the order of three emotion or three neutral words. The investigators hypothesize that the pupil size will be decreased when sorting negative words in working memory in depressed patients that received active tDCS over the left DLPFC in combination with attentional training.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be utilized to evaluate autonomic activity by recording electrocardiogram or pulse wave. High HRV has been associated with greater behavioral adaptability and plays a major role in the adaptive recovery from stress. After the treatment, the investigators expect MDD patients that received tDCS with working memory training to demonstrate increased HRV while viewing negative high arousing IAPS pictures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be utilized to evaluate endocrinological response of the hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal(HPA)axis, such as cortisol secretion. After the treatment, the investigators expect MDD patients that received tDCS with working memory training to demonstrate decreased cortisol secretion while viewing negative high arousing IAPS pictures.</description>
