  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), combination therapy with an
      alpha-blocker (AB) and a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) has been shown to reduce the
      progression of acute urinary retention (AUR) and the incidence of prostate surgery, and also
      provides symptom relief.

      The objective of this study is to compare the likelihood of clinical progression (defined as
      AUR and/or prostate-related surgery) and costs in BPH patients who were treated with delayed
      combination therapy to BPH patients who were treated with early combination therapy using
      data from a United States (US) healthcare claims database. The hypothesis of this study is
      that patients who are prescribed combination therapy early in their BPH treatment will
      experience better clinical outcomes and lower healthcare costs compared with patients treated
      with delayed combination therapy. The null hypothesis is that no difference will be observed
      in outcomes or direct medical costs for patients treated with early combination therapy and
      patients treated with delayed combination therapy.

      The US healthcare claims database includes data from patients with Medicare Advantage as well
      as private health plan coverage including the Impact health plan. About 14 million people
      were covered by this set of health plans in 2007 and were geographically diverse across the
      US. Data from 2000 through 2009 were utilized.

      The study is a retrospective cohort analysis.
