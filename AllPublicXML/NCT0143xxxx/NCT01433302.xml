      The goal of this clinical research study is to measure the amount of inflammatory proteins
      inside the body before and after lymphatico-venular bypass surgery. This will help doctors
      learn if anti-fibrotic or anti-inflammatory drugs/treatments given with the surgery can
      improve how well the surgery works.

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will have 1 small piece of tissue (about the
      size of a pencil eraser) collected from the arm with the lymphedema and another small piece
      of tissue will be collected from the unaffected arm. A total of 4 samples will be collected
      by excisional biopsy (2 samples before the surgery and 2 more samples again 6 months after
      the surgery). To collect an excisional biopsy, the area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and
      a small cut is made to remove all or part of the affected tissue.

      Blood (about 5 teaspoons each time) will also be drawn before the surgery and 1 more blood
      sample again 6 months after the surgery. If possible, the blood samples will be collected
      during already scheduled blood draws to avoid additional needle sticks.

      The tissue and blood samples will be used for testing to evaluate the level of the tissue
      inflammation and to check for any build-up of excess tissue.

      Length of Study:

      After both tissue and blood samples have been collected, your participation in this study
      will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>5 mm punch biopsy specimens from the affected, lymphedematous limb will be obtained just prior to lymphatico-venular bypass and six (6) months after lymphatico-venular bypass. Punch biopsies will be obtained from the radial (lateral) aspect of the upper arm approximately 10cm above the olecranon process. Biopsy specimens will be collected from the contralateral (normal) arm at the exact same location.</description>
