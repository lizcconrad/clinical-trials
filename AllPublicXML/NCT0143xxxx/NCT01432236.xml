    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to identify and treat fibromyalgia subjects with comorbid
      depression who are receiving an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or SNRI
      (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) primarily for their depression and to determine
      whether pregabalin demonstrates improvement relative to placebo in improving pain associated
      with fibromyalgia.

    <measure>Mean NRS Pain Score at End of Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each period, at Weeks 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The daily pain diary consists of an 11-point numeric scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Participants describe their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. The endpoint mean pain scores for Period 1 and Period 2 are defined as the mean of the last 7 non-missing daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in the double-blind phase during Period 1 and Period 2, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) Score at Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This was a 20-item participant reported outcome instrument. It contained 10 subscales, which were combined to yield a total score. The first 11 questions were related specifically to physical functioning subscale, ranging from 0 to 10. The remaining 9 questions assessed pain, fatigue, stiffness, difficulty working, and symptoms of anxiety and depression ranging from 0 to 10. The higher values indicated greater impairment. All 20 were combined to form a total score ranging from 0 to 100, provides an estimation of fibromyalgia impact with higher scores indicating more impairment. The severity categorizations for the FIQ are: less than 40 (mild), 40-60 (moderate), and above 60 (severe).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire - Mean Sleep Quality at End of Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each period, at Weeks 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire included 5 items: participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Subjective rating of quality of sleep during the past night was done by selecting a number between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). Mean sleep quality was calculated as the mean of the last seven days, the potential range of responses was therefore 0-10.</description>

    <measure>Mean EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) Score at Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, participant-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).</description>

    <measure>PGIC at the End of Period 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period 2 at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC: participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Because of the crossover design and PGIC recall period (since starting study medication), the Period 1 PGIC data were felt to provide the clearest comparison across treatments, whereas Period 2 PGIC data were felt to have a more complex interpretation. Thus PGIC at End of Period 2 was separately analyzed from PGIC at End of Period 1.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Categorical Scores on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following: completed suicide (1), suicide attempt (2) (response of &quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (3) (&quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;), suicidal ideation (4) (&quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), any suicidal behavior or ideation, self-injurious behavior (7) (&quot;Yes&quot; on &quot;Has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Categorical Scores on the C-SSRS at Post-Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 3 to Visit 14</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following:completed suicide (1), suicide attempt (2) (response of Yes on &quot;actual attempt&quot;), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (3) (Yes on &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;), suicidal ideation (4) (Yes on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), any suicidal behavior or ideation, self-injurious behavior (7) (Yes on &quot;Has subject engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;). Below table indicated one participant (10141023) treated with Pregabalin reported preparatory act. However upon study unblinding it was clarified that preparatory act occurred while the participant was taking placebo. Since preparatory act was reported at first visit of Period 2, by convention statistical summaries classified this under Pregabalin treatment.</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Index-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) Questionnaire at Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>WPAI-SHP assessed work productivity and impairment. It was a participant-rated, six-item questionnaire regarding current employment, hours missed and actually worked, and degree to which a specified health problem affected work productivity and regular activities over the past 7 days. Subscale scores included percent work time missed due to the health problem; percent impairment while working due to problem; percent overall work impairment due to problem; and percent activity impairment due to problem. Each subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (0-100) where higher numbers indicated greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In this double blind, crossover study, a total of 197 participants were randomized to either pregabalin/placebo or placebo/pregabalin treatment sequence. Of these, 193 took at least one dose of study medication. Four randomized participants never took study medication. Randomized participants were recruited from 4 countries at 38 study centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with mean Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score of ≥4 at Baseline and meeting all other inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive double blind treatment with either pregabalin followed by placebo with background antidepressant or placebo followed by pregabalin with background antidepressant.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean NRS Pain Score at End of Period.</title>
        <description>The daily pain diary consists of an 11-point numeric scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants describe their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. The endpoint mean pain scores for Period 1 and Period 2 are defined as the mean of the last 7 non-missing daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in the double-blind phase during Period 1 and Period 2, respectively.</description>

            <title>Pregabalin</title>
            <description>The below table included participants who received pregabalin in either treatment period pooled together due to the crossover study design. This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6-week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period (3 weeks dose optimization and 3 weeks fixed dose for each treatment period). Pregabalin was administered as immediate release (IR) capsule with a starting dose of 150 mg/day and increased up to 300 - 450 mg/day during the dose optimization process.

          <title>Mean NRS Pain Score at End of Period.</title>
          <description>The daily pain diary consists of an 11-point numeric scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants describe their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. The endpoint mean pain scores for Period 1 and Period 2 are defined as the mean of the last 7 non-missing daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in the double-blind phase during Period 1 and Period 2, respectively.</description>

        <description>This was a 20-item participant reported outcome instrument. It contained 10 subscales, which were combined to yield a total score. The first 11 questions were related specifically to physical functioning subscale, ranging from 0 to 10. The remaining 9 questions assessed pain, fatigue, stiffness, difficulty working, and symptoms of anxiety and depression ranging from 0 to 10. The higher values indicated greater impairment. All 20 were combined to form a total score ranging from 0 to 100, provides an estimation of fibromyalgia impact with higher scores indicating more impairment. The severity categorizations for the FIQ are: less than 40 (mild), 40-60 (moderate), and above 60 (severe).</description>

        <title>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire - Mean Sleep Quality at End of Period.</title>
        <description>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire included 5 items: participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (NRS) for the previous night. Subjective rating of quality of sleep during the past night was done by selecting a number between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). Mean sleep quality was calculated as the mean of the last seven days, the potential range of responses was therefore 0-10.</description>

        <title>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire - Parameter Estimates for Subjective Number of Awakenings Per Night After Sleep Onset at End of Period.</title>
        <description>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire included, participants report latency (how long it took them to fall asleep), how many hours they slept, the number of times they woke up, the total wake time after sleep onset, and then rate the quality of their sleep (numeric rating scale) for the previous night. Subjective number of awakenings after sleep onset was the subjective estimate of the total number of times the participant awakened during the night until final awakening.</description>

        <title>Mean EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) Score at Baseline.</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, participant-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).</description>

It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).</description>

        <description>C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following:completed suicide (1), suicide attempt (2) (response of Yes on “actual attempt”), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (3) (Yes on “preparatory acts or behavior”), suicidal ideation (4) (Yes on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), any suicidal behavior or ideation, self-injurious behavior (7) (Yes on “Has subject engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior”). Below table indicated one participant (10141023) treated with Pregabalin reported preparatory act. However upon study unblinding it was clarified that preparatory act occurred while the participant was taking placebo. Since preparatory act was reported at first visit of Period 2, by convention statistical summaries classified this under Pregabalin treatment.</description>

            <description>The below table included participants who received pregabalin in either treatment period pooled together due to the crossover study design. This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6-week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period (3 weeks dose optimization and 3 weeks fixed dose for each treatment period). Pregabalin was administered as immediate release (IR) capsule with a starting dose of 150 mg/day and increased up to 300 - 450 mg/day during the dose optimization process. There was a 2-week single-blind taper/washout period between treatment periods.</description>

        <description>WPAI-SHP assessed work productivity and impairment. It was a participant-rated, six-item questionnaire regarding current employment, hours missed and actually worked, and degree to which a specified health problem affected work productivity and regular activities over the past 7 days. Subscale scores included percent work time missed due to the health problem; percent impairment while working due to problem; percent overall work impairment due to problem; and percent activity impairment due to problem. Each subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (0-100) where higher numbers indicated greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <description>The below table included participants who received pregabalin in either treatment period pooled together due to the crossover study design. This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6-week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period (3 weeks dose optimization and 3 weeks fixed dose for each treatment period). Pregabalin was administered as immediate release (IR) capsule with a starting dose of 150 mg/day and increased up to 300 - 450 mg/day during the dose optimization process. There was a 2-week single-blind taper/washout period between treatment periods.</description>
