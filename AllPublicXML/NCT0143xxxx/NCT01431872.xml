    <textblock>
      The investigators are hypothesizing that decreasing estrogen levels will cause serum DKK1 to
      peak, then decrease gradually as estrogens reach a new lower, but steady level. The
      investigators also believe that the peak in DKK1 will initiated a wave of stem cell diversion
      from the osteoblastogenic pathway to the adipogenic pathway.

      The investigators will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of post menopausal women with
      hormone-responsive breast cancer that will be treated AIs. The study will observe
      anthromorphic and serum marker changes during the first year of their treatment.

    <measure>Estrogen level suppresses DKK1</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>With the start of AI treatment, estrogen levels will decline to almost undetectable levels. We believe this decrease in estrogen will lift suppression of DKK1 and allow its expression to peak during the 1st month of treatment, and decline more slowly thereafter. During the first 26 weeks of treatment, we expect levels of CTx to rise, PTH to fall, and P1NP to show no change, findings that would be consistent with Heshmati's study.</description>
