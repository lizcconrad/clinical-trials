  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to find out what the pharmacokinetic/dynamic (PK/PD)
      characteristics of desmopressin melt are in nocturia patients (compared to healthy volunteers
      and children). The main questions the investigators want to answer are:

        -  Are differences related to the pathophysiological factors involved in nocturia?

        -  Are there age/gender/size differences?

        -  Can the investigators identify patients who are likely to develop hyponatraemia?

        -  Can the investigators individualize treatment and reduce risk for hyponatraemia?

      Day 1:

        -  Patient is being hospitalized in the morning

        -  General anamnesis and clinical examination

        -  Uroflow and residue measurements (3x)

        -  Sober blood sample, to determine plasma concentrations of Na+, Cl-, osmolality and
           creatinin

      Day 1-2:

      - In the evening at 20h:

        -  start (with empty bladder!) 24h miction-incontinence-residue registration: urine
           collections every 3 hours (every portion of urine within a period of 3 hours must be
           collected in the same collection device), with: registration of volumes and measurement
           urinary concentrations of Na+, Cl-, osmolality and creatinin

        -  Measurement of blood pressure during 24h

      Day 2-3:

        -  In the evening at 19h (day 2): drink 15mL/kg water

        -  At 20h: take desmopressin melt 120µg + start:

             -  24h miction-incontinence-residue registration: registration of volumes and
                measurement urinary concentrations of Na+, Cl-, osmolality and creatinin (U1-U7)

             -  Measurement of blood pressure during 24h

             -  Collection of urine:U1 at 19h, U2 at 20h, together with intake of first
                desmopressin melt, U3 at 21h = 1h after desmopressin melt intake, U4 at 22h = 2
                after desmopressin melt intake,U5 at 23h = 3h after desmopressin melt intake, U6 at
                2h (day 3) = 6h after desmopressin melt intake, U7 at 8h = 12h after desmopressin
                melt intake

             -  Blood samples for blood levels of desmopressin: 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h after desmopressin
                melt intake, 12h after desmopressin melt intake + plasma concentrations of Na+,
                Cl-, osmolality and creatinin (safety profile)

             -  At 8h in the morning (day 3): drink 15mL/kg water + collection of urine per hour
                during 3h with measurement of urinary concentrations of Na+, Cl-, osmolality and
                creatinin: U8 at 9h, U9 at 10h, U10 at 11h

        -  Patient can go home on day 3, unless he is at high risk for side effects, high-risk
           patients are hospitalized for 7 days
