  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers will complete questionnaires and smoking behaviour will be examined. After abstaining
      from smoking for approximately 18 hours, they will be randomized to a moderate intensity
      exercise group or passive sitting group. Smoking behaviour (time to first puff) will be
      assessed following treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canadians (Canadian Cancer Society, in
      which cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of these cases. Smoking topography, a key
      facet of smoking behaviour, can be subjectively or objectively measured by quantifying puff
      volume, maximum puff velocity, interpuff interval, puff duration, number of puffs per
      cigarette, and the time to smoke a single cigarette. Smoking topography can estimate exposure
      to carcinogenic toxins present in cigarette smoking (Djordjevic, Hoffman, &amp; Hoffman, 1997).
      Evidence exists to support that exercise modifies smoking topography (Katomeri &amp; Taylor 2006;
      Mikhail, 1983; Reeser, 1983; Zacny &amp; Stitzer, 1985).

      Recently, Faulkner and colleagues (2011; N = 18) were the first to implement a handheld
      smoking topography device (CReSS Pocket) to measure smoking behaviour in the context of an
      acute bout of exercise after a temporary period of abstinence. They found that brisk walking
      influences an individual's smoking topography. In specific, participants assigned to the
      exercise condition smoked less per puff and took shorter puff durations, compared to the
      passive sitting condition. Overall, smoking topographical studies require further
      investigation due to methodological flaws in order to allow for the objective collection of
      smoking behaviour data and improved external validity in a sufficiently powered study.
      Furthermore, the role of cravings, withdrawal and affect as potential mediators of
      topographical changes due to exercise is a novel area of research.

    <description>Smoking topography will be assessed using the Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) Pocket, a computer-based, battery-powered, hand-held unit by Plowshare TechnologiesÂ®. The CReSS Pocket has an orifice flow meter mouthpiece, and a pressure drop related to the flow rate that is produced when a puff is taken. From the flow rate, the CReSS derives puff count (number of puffs per cigarette), puff volume (the volume of carbon monoxide take in during each puff), puff duration (length of time for each puff), inter-puff interval (amount of time between puffs), and time to first puff.</description>

    <description>The moderate exercise condition will involve participants walking briskly (equivalent to moderate intensity) on a treadmill for 10 minutes. Moderate intensity exercise will be defined as 40-68% of the resting heart rate reserve. Heart rate (HR) will be monitored in participants using a Polar RS100 Heart Rate monitor to serve as a guide for participants to attain the appropriate intensity.</description>

    <description>The passive sitting condition will involve participants sitting passively for 10 minutes on a chair. Heart rate (HR) will be monitored in participants of the passive sitting group to help maintain group equivalency (with the moderate exercise condition) in regards to distraction effects and researcher contact.</description>
