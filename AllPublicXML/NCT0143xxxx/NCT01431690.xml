    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Epanova® on the
      pharmacokinetic and anticoagulant activity of warfarin.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the systemic exposure of EPA and DHA
      following multiple-dose administration of Epanova®, a free fatty acid mixture, to Lovaza®, a
      mixture of fatty acid ethyl esters, under low-fat meal conditions since these products are
      likely to be administered to patients with cardiovascular disease who are recommended to
      consume low-fat meals.
