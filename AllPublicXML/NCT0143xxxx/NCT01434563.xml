  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the prevalence of HIV associated Neurological Disorder (HAND) in a population of
      HIV positive patients within a primary care setting compared with the HIV negative
      population. The investigators aim is to assess the use of optimal screening methods to assess
      HAND. For this the investigators will be comparing the performance of a group of persons who
      are HIV positive and a group of persons who are HIV negative to test their memory and
      concentration abilities over-time.
