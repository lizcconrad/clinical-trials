  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adventitial vasa vasorum (VV) as well as intraplaque microvessels are known to be associated
      with atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been validated as
      a technique to measure the density of VV. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship
      between identification of VV and relationship to vascular events such as stroke and
      myocardial infarction. No previous study has reported the utilization of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound identification of VV in the carotid bed as a means of identifying patients at high
      risk for acute coronary events.

      Aims: In this study, the investigators will aim to identify VV and intraplaque microvessels
      along with carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), a known marker for acute coronary events.
      The investigators will attempt to measure the correlation of VV with acute coronary events
      independent of traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and CIMT.

      Methods: 90 volunteers (30 low risk patients, 30 patients with established coronary artery
      disease (CAD), and 30 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS)) will be enrolled.
      All patients will undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging of their carotid arteries and
      measurement of CIMT while obtaining baseline histories and assessment of traditional risk
      factors for coronary artery disease. VV density and CIMT will be measured in all patients.
      Statistical differences in VV among the three groups will be assessed and analyses will be
      made to attempt to identify if VV in the carotid bed is an independent predictor of acute
      coronary events after controlling for CIMT and traditional risk factors.

      Study population: The study population will reflect the patient population of UPMC. No
      individual will be excluded on the basis of race, gender, or ethnicity.
