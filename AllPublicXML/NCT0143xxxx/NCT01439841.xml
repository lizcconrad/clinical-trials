  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV progression is closely associated with chronic immune activation driven by leakage of
      bacterial products from a damaged gut, the investigators largest immunological organ.
      Notably, the degree of immune activation has been suggested to be a better predictor of
      disease progression than plasma viral load, and markers of immune activation and gut damage
      have been identified as therapeutic targets per se. The major damage by HIV to the immune
      system is an initial massacre of gut mucosal CD4+ Th17 cells. Interestingly, a normal gut
      flora has been shown to induce the maturation of Th17 cells in the small intestine mucosa.
      Preliminary reports have shown that the gut flora is altered in HIV-1 infection compared to
      controls. In this project, the investigators will characterize microbial composition of gut
      flora in chronic HIV infection with ultradeep sequencing. Gut flora composition will be
      related to clinical data as well as quantitative data of circulating microbial products and
      activation markers. Second, in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) the effect of probiotic
      lactobacilli on HIV pathogenesis and progression will be tested. This Gram-positive strain is
      clinically tested and is able to colonize the gut.

      Objectives:

      To explore (i) the safety and tolerability, and (ii) the efficacy of probiotics on
      HIV-associated microbial translocation, systemic immune activation, disease progression and
      composition of gut microbiota in chronic HIV-1 infection.

      Methodology/Study design:

      Approximately 50 patients without current indication for antiretroviral treatment (ART) and
      50 patients receiving ART without normalised CD4 counts will be included. A controlled
      clinical trial will be carried out within each stratum randomised in a 2:1:1 fashion to
      double blinded intervention and placebo arms as well as an open, untreated control arm,
      respectively.
