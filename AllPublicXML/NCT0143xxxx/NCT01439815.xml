    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the onset of action of fluticasone propionate nasal
      spray compared to placebo nasal spray in reducing nasal allergic signs and symptoms following
      ragweed exposure in the Allergen BioCube (ABC) after up to 14 days of at home dosing.

    <description>TNSS (0-12 unit scale) is defined as the sum of the four nasal symptom scores recorded for nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. Evaluated by the subject pre-ABC exposure, every 15 minutes during all ragweed exposures in the ABC, and post-ABC exposure at Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 which will occur over approximately 3 weeks</description>
