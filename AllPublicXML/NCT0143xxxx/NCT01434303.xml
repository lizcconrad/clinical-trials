    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together
      with lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab in treating patients with breast cancer that has
      spread from the original (primary) tumor to distant organs or distant lymph nodes or has
      recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the original (primary) tumor, usually after
      a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. Entinostat and lapatinib
      ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving entinostat together with lapatinib ditosylate and
      trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for entinostat in combination with
      lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) in patients whom trastuzumab has failed for human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2+ (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (Phase I).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for entinostat in combination with
      lapatinib and trastuzumab in patients whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast
      cancer (Phase I Trastuzumab Cohort).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity of combination therapy with entinostat and lapatinib in patients
      whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (Phase I).

      II. To determine the toxicity of entinostat in combination with lapatinib and trastuzumab in
      patients whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (Phase I Trastuzumab
      Cohort).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the 2-drug combination modulates the expression of HER2, phosphorylated
      HER2 (pHER), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), v-akt
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt), and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in breast tumors
      and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 15 and lapatinib tosylate PO on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients in the Phase I trastuzumab cohort also receive maintenance dose of
      trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days or until toxicities
      are resolved.
