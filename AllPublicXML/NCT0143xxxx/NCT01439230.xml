    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of donepezil 10
      mg tablet (test) versus Aricept速 (reference), administered as a 1 x 10 mg tablet under
      fasting conditions.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality or abnormal laboratory test results found
             during medical screening.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the Medical Sub-Investigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV at screening.

          -  ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood
             pressure lower than 95 or over 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or
             over 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at screening.

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse or drug abuse within one year prior to screening
             visit.

          -  Regular use of alcohol within 12 months prior to the screening visit (more than 14
             units of alcohol per week [1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40%

          -  Any clinically significant history or presence of neurological, endocrinal,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, immunologic, psychiatric, or metabolic
             disease.

             garlic as a supplement) within 7 days prior to administration of the study medication,
             except for topical products without systemic absorption and hormonal contraceptives.

          -  Difficulty to swallow study medication.

          -  Use of any tobacco products in the 3 months preceding the screening visit.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction, or special diet that, in the opinion of

             study.

          -  A depot injection or an implant of any drug (other than hormonal contraceptives)
             within 3 months prior to administration of the study medication.

          -  Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days prior to drug administration. Donation of
             loss of whole blood (excluding the volume of blood that will be drawn during the
