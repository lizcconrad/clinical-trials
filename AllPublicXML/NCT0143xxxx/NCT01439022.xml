      This study sets out to determine the effect of exercise performed over a longer period of
      time (6 months), delivered using community facilities, on motor and non motor symptoms,
      health and well being in people with Parkinson's Disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in exercise is beneficial for health and well being, but the effect over a
      longer period of time in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been established.
      People with PD currently only receive short-term support for exercise therapy interventions
      funded from the National Health Service; it is therefore unsurprising that people with PD are
      observed to have low levels of physical activity that decrease over time.

      Using mixed methodology the investigators will explore the effect of exercise delivered over
      a longer period of time (six months) in people with PD. The investigators will examine the
      views of people participating in the program.

      Aims

      Using a randomized controlled trial with one intervention arm and an active comparator
      control group with blinded assessments and semi-structured interview techniques the
      investigators will determine in people with PD:

        1. The effect of longer-term exercise participation on motor symptoms

        2. The effect of longer-term exercise participation on non motor symptoms, fitness, health
           and well being.

        3. Participants views of the process and sustainability of community provision of exercise
           over a longer period of time.
