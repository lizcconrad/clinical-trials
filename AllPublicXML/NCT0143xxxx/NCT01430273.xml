      Main Objective: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether there is a correlation
      between perioperative blood loss and the degree of platelet inhibition assessed by a point of
      care assay in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty and treated by antiplatelet
      mono/bi-therapy

      Type of study : Prospective, non-interventional, multicenter registry Principal Investigator:
      Collet Jean-Philippe Rational: Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in patients with
      established coronary artery disease (CAD) has become an increasingly important concern given
      the risk of recurrent arterial event. Exaggerated concern about increased procedure-related
      bleeding remains the major factor for premature discontinuation of APT. Interruption
      modalities and their impact on perioperative bleeding has never been prospectively evaluated
      and it is accepted that the maximum duration of interruption should not exceed 5 days for
      Clopidogrel/Ticagrelor and 7 days for Prasugrel given the fact that the remaining
      antiplatelet effect of APT is observed in less than 50% of patients after 3 days of
      interruption. Resuming APT after the operation has never been studied and remains a complex
      situation during anticoagulation is often prescribed to prevent deep vein thrombosis further
      increasing perioperative bleeding.

      Hypotheses: (i) the volume of perioperative blood loss is correlated to the degree of
      platelet inhibition. (ii) Clopidogrel metabolizer status as defined by genetic profile is
      also correlated to perioperative blood loss. (iii) Resuming antiplatelet therapy during the
      perioperative period is not associated with a significant recovery of the antiplatelet
      effect.

      Primary endpoint: Perioperative (day 1-day 5) blood loss in mL assessed by NADLER &amp; Mercurial
      formula* and PRU** (for patients under Clopidogrel/ARU*** as measured using the
      VerifyNow®P2Y12 and aspirin assays at baseline. Secondary objectives: (i) to evaluate the
      correlation between clopidogrel genetic metabolizer status**** and perioperative blood loss.
      To evaluate antiplatelet pharmacodynamic response at discharge according to metabolizer
      status. Definition*Blood loss in mL of Red Blood Cell (RBC) = Compensated RBC Volume (1
      Pack=150mL) + Non Compensated RBC Vol. (Total Blood Loss : Ht D-1-Ht D+5). *PRU=Platelet
      Reaction Unit. It is a specific measure of on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity. Cut-off value
      is for defining high-on clopidogrel platelet reactivity is 230. **ARU=Aspirin Reaction Unit.
      It is a specific measure of on-aspirin platelet reactivity. Cutoff value to identify high
      on-aspirin platelet reactivity is 550. ***Clopidogrel Metabolizer Phenotype is defined
      according to the carriage of the loss/gain-of function allele 2C19*2-*8/*17 as follows: SM
      for slow metabolizer: (*2-*8/*2-*8) ; Ultrafast Metabolizer (FM): (*17/*17) ;
      Normal/intermediate (M): (wt/wt, wt/*17, *2-*8/*17 or *2-*8/wt)

      Number of subjects : 200 patients

      Study duration: Two years.

      Study duration per subject: length of hospital stay with a maximum duration of 30 days.

        This study targets CAD patients exposed to antiplatelelt mono/bitherapy who need planned or
        emergency knee/hip athroplasty. This innovative study will bring new insights on how works
        antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period according to drug exposition and
        metabolizer profile.

        Patients ethnicity will be recorded and defined according to the place of birth of the
        participants and of their parents given the identification of the metabolizer profile with
        respect to the CYP 2C19*2 carriage. The analysis will bestratified according to ethnicity
        to avoid biases.
