  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing of initiating short-term treatment for COPD exacerbations with oral
      corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy has been shown to influence the recovery time of
      exacerbations with early initiation of exacerbation therapy having a faster symptom recovery
      compared to delayed initiation. While oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy are
      crucial for immediate exacerbation therapy, maintenance therapy with controller medications
      for COPD has been recommended to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. The initiation of
      maintenance therapy after a COPD exacerbation has been shown to be beneficial in the
      reduction of risk of future exacerbations. However, there is a lack of information on whether
      the timing of this initiation influences the risk of future exacerbations. The following
      study evaluates the impact of early versus delayed initiation of controller medication
      therapy for maintenance treatment following a COPD-related exacerbation on outcomes of future
      exacerbations and costs in patients with COPD.

      Study period for this analysis will range from January 2003 through June 2009. Patients with
      at least one COPD exacerbation will be selected as the initial population. Three types of
      COPD exacerbations will be identified: 1) hospitalization with a primary discharge diagnosis
      code for COPD, 2) an emergency department (ED) visit with a primary diagnosis code for COPD,
      3) physician visit with a dispensing of oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic (ABX) within
      5 days of the visit. Only the first two will be selected as index exacerbations, which is
      defined as the first chronologically occurring exacerbation for a patient. For
      hospitalization exacerbations the discharge date of the hospitalization will be the index
      date and for ED exacerbations the date of the visit will be the index date. The pre-index
      period will be defined as the 1-year period before index date and the post-index period will
      be defined as 1-year period after index date. The enrollment period will thus range from
      January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2008. The post-index period will be used to identify the
      date of receipt of prescription for first COPD maintenance medication. This date of receipt
      will be used to compute the time to start maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment refers
      to the use of controller medications.

      Specifically the study hypothesis for the primary outcome being tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit between early and
      delayed cohorts Ha: There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit
      between early and delayed cohorts

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts Ha: There
      is a difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts

        Patients meeting study criteria mentioned belowwere classified into two cohorts, early and
        delayed, based on timing of (maintenance treatment) MTx after the index date - 0 to 30 days
        and 31 to 180 days, respectively. A 30-day period was chosen to define early initiation
        based on sample size considerations and recent evidence demonstrating the increased risk of
        subsequent exacerbations during an 8-week period following an initial exacerbation [Hurst
        JR 2009]. Outcomes were computed for and compared between these two cohorts. An incremental
        analysis evaluating the effect of delaying MTx by every 30 days was also done classifying
        patients into six categories based on 30-day increments of starting MTx (0 to 30 days, 31
        to 60 days, 61 to 90 days, 91 to 120 days, 121 to 150 days, and 151 to 180 days) (Figure
        1). Outcomes were then compared across the 6 categories thereby allowing assessment for
        every 30-day increment up to 180 days after the index date.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  at least 40 years of age,

          -  continuously enrolled for medical and pharmacy benefits during their pre- and
             post-period

          -  diagnosis of COPD (ICD 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they had MTx in the pre-index period (to ensure inclusion of
             MTx-na√Øve patients) or if they received their first MTx during 181 to 365 days of the
             post-period (as dispensing of MTx unlikely to be related to the index exacerbation).

          -  Additionally, patients were excluded if they had any of the following comorbid
             conditions anytime during the study period: respiratory cancer, cystic fibrosis,
             fibrosis due to, bronchiectasis, pneumonociosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary
             tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis, and

          -  also if they had other doses (unapproved in the US) of fluticasone
             propionate-salmeterol xinafoate combination (100/50 mcg or 500/50 mcg) or budesonide
             dipropionate-formoterol fumarate fixed dose combination (any dose).
