      INTRODUCTION. Amblyopia is defined as the loss of visual acuity (VA) in one or both eyes,
      without any obvious structural or pathological anomalies. Amblyopic eye should be able to
      regain some VA if treatment is initiated before the age of seven. It is the leading cause of
      monocular blindness in the 20- to 70-year olds with prevalence 2-5%. Amblyopia is mainly
      monocular, hence children are general asymptomatic. VA testing is the only reliable method of
      detecting amblyopia, and the fourth year of life is considered best for vision screening
      programs.

      AIM: The purpose of the study is to reduce the preventable vision loss. The main goal of the
      study is to evidence the problem of amblyopia in Zagreb and to release a model for formal,
      government directed vision-screening program as a Croatian public health policy.

      HYPOTHESIS. In Croatia, the prevalence and actual effect of amblyopia and amblyogenic
      factors, along with treatment efficacy is impossible to quantify, since no population-based
      studies have been performed regarding this issue. In addition, national screening of
      preschool children does not exist, while the school-entry screening is prescribed by law. The
      object of the study is to determine the prevalence of amblyopia in a 4-4.5 year old children
      of The Town of Zagreb, the efficacy of screening and effectiveness of treatment on reducing
      amblyopia prevalence. The primary hypothesis is defined: screening of visual acuity
      monocularly at distance and near in 4-4.5 year old children in Zagreb is effective in
      detecting amblyopia.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocular vision of about 7000 children/ year aged 4-4.5 for whom both
      parents gave consent is to be tested with Lea chart at near (40cm) and distance (3m) in the
      kindergartens of The Town of Zagreb. The criterion for referral to complete ophthalmological
      examination is VA &lt;0.8.
