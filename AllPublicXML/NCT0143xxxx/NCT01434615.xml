    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (a) characterize the current management of patients with
      systolic heart failure (HF) in South Asia following an educational intervention of current
      guidelines and delivery of disease management tools and (b) to characterize the effect of
      current therapy on clinical outcomes in patients managed by tertiary care centers across
      South Asia. Current therapy includes characterization of the post market performance of any
      market released Medtronic cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or cardiac
      resynchronization therapy plus implantable cardiac defibrillator (CRT-D) system for cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed and dated study informed consent. Patients having moderate to
             severe heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) EF &lt; 35% as measured by echo, MUGA,
             contrast ventriculogram or MRI. QRS duration &gt; 120 ms.

          -  Patient is known to have chronic permanent atrial arrhythmias (i.e., cases of
             long-standing atrial fibrillation of greater than 1 year, including those in which
             cardioversion has not been indicated or attempted).
