  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of bladder pain syndrome is unknown. Therefore the management is directed to
      pain relief, as bladder pain is believed to drive both voiding frequency and nocturia.
      Botulinum toxin A has been shown to decrease noxious input. Several studies showed efficacy
      of botox for treatment of painful bladder.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Botulinum toxin in patients who are
      suffering bladder pain syndrome with Hunner lesions during cystoscopy.
