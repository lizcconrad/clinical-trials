    <textblock>
      The ReStore™ Thrombectomy device restores blood flow in the neurovascular by removing
      thrombus in patients experiencing ischemic stroke. Patients enrolled in the ReStore Trial
      will be randomized to treatment with the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device (investigational
      treatment) or to treatment with a commercially available thrombectomy device It is expected
      that the investigational treatment safety profile in terms of clinically significant
      procedural adverse events will be comparable to the control group.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the ReStore™
      Thrombectomy Device with the legally marketed MERCI Retrieval System. The study will evaluate
      safety and efficacy of the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device in subjects diagnosed with acute
      ischemic stroke who require mechanical thrombectomy. All eligible patients will be enrolled
      and randomized to treatment with either the investigational therapy or the control therapy.

             treatment as compared to the initial screen

             vasculitis

          -  At the discretion of the investigator, patients with co-morbidities associated with a
