  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of comprehensive biliary Optical
      Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) for assessing common bile duct or common hepatic duct
      strictures, determining cholangiocarcinoma margins, and evaluating primary sclerosing
      cholangitis (PSC).

      The study will be conducted in approximately 20 patients with known or suspected common bile
      duct or common hepatic duct stricture scheduled for endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with duodenoscope-assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy (DACP) and
      biopsy.

      Following initial fluoroscopic evaluation, the study experimental procedure will begin. The
      catheter will be passed through the auxiliary channel of the duodenoscope, across the papilla
      and into the common bile duct. The extra-biliary portion of the catheter will be visible by
      the duodenoscope at all times. The intrabiliary portion of the catheter will be visible by
      fluoroscopy, and will be positioned across the biliary stricture. Rotational cross-sectional
      images of the bile duct will be obtained using the OFDI imaging catheter while pulling back
      the internal optical components over a pre-determined length. OFDI imaging will be conducted
      approximately from 1 cm distal to 1 cm and proximal to the stricture margins identified by
      fluoroscopy.
