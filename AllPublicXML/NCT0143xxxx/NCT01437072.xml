      This study is conducted in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Europe. The aim of this study
      is to contribute to the design of a simple screening strategy for countries in scope, by
      exploring the association between risk factors and undiagnosed diabetes in a screening study.

        The Changing Diabetes® World Tour is designed as a mobile screening clinic staying for a
        minimum of 14 days in each location such as malls, public squares, etc. Subjects included
        in the study are either actively seeking to be screened, or are invited by subjects in
        their network already included in the study.
