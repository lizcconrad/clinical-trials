      Current guidelines recommend standard warfarin anticoagulation international normalized ratio
      (INR) goal of 2.0-3.0 in adults with non valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The
      investigators hypothesized that low-intensity warfarin (INR 1.5-2.0) has the same
      effectiveness and better security in elderly patients (&gt;75) with NVAF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the commonest chronic arrhythmia in clinical practice, especially in
      octogenarians. Nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke by
      approximately 5-fold and these strokes result in higher mortality and disability. Warfarin is
      recommended as ﬁrst line anticoagulation treatment in patients with NVAF who are at moderate
      or high risk of stroke,while antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, give a more convenient but
      less effective alternative in the prevention of ischemic stroke and are recommended in low
      risk patients.Current guideline about warfarin anticoagulation therapy recommend that target
      INR value must be maintained between 2.0 and 3.0,which not only reduces the frequency of
      ischaemic stroke but also its low incidence of major bleeding. However, the current status of
      anticoagulation therapy for elderly Chinese AF patients, particularly in aged over 80 years,
      is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an INR target
      of 1.5-2.0 can provide the same efficacy and better safety as compare with a standard target
      of 2.0-3.0 in patients over 75 with NVAF.

    <measure>major haemorrhage</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Major haemorrhage was defined as intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding requiring hospitalization and surgical intervention, a reduction of hemoglobin by≥2 g/dL, requiring red blood cells transfusion ≥2 units.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. In addition, the number of bleeding events was recorded.</description>

    <measure>ischaemic stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ischaemic stroke was defined as a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain , resulting in a deficiency in blood flow and focal neurological deficit lasting &gt;24 hours.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. In addition, the number of ischaemic stroke was recorded.</description>

    <measure>minor bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5years</time_frame>
    <description>Minor bleeding was any other bleeding requiring modiﬁcation of the antithrombotic regimen,such as hematuria, gingival, conjunctival bleeding and so on.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. In addition, the number of minor bleedinge was recorded.</description>

    <description>Myocardial infarction was defined as occurrence of typical chest pain, ECG and cardiac enzyme abnormalities.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. The number of myocardial infarction was recorded.</description>

    <description>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was defined as a blood clot in a major vein that usually develops in the legs and/or pelvis and blocks blood flow, which can be diagnosised by ultrasound.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. The number of deep vein thrombosis was recorded.</description>

    <measure>pulmonary embolism</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary embolism was defined as occurrence of typical shortness of breath, chest pain, D-dimer and CT pulmonary angiography abnormalities.
Follow-up study visits were scheduled for once a week in the first month and then every 3 months. The number and results of INR tests, liver and kidney function tests were recorded. The number of pulmonary embolism was recorded.</description>
