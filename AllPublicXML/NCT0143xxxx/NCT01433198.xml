      Aim:

      - to investigate the effects of an aquatic exercise program in patients with severe scars

      Patient population:

        -  10 patients of at least 18 years old

        -  patients with scars after burns or other severe skin injuries

        -  stratification into two groups: an intervention group and a control group

      Method:

        -  8 patients will participate in the aquatic exercise group and 2 patients in the control
           group

        -  assessment of physical fitness parameters, scar tissue and psychosocial impact

      Hypothesis:

      - patients of the aquatic exercise group will recover sooner and better (physically and
      psychologically) than patients of the control group

      Intervention:

      - during 6 weeks patients will performed an aquatic exercise program (2 to 3 sessions a week)

      Assessment:

        -  T0: post-hospitalisation status: body mass index, physical fitness, strength and
           respiratory function

        -  T1: at baseline: body mass index, physical fitness, strength, respiratory function,
           exercise capacity, mobility, scar parameters and some questionnaires

        -  T2: after 6 weeks training: same measurements as T1

        -  T3: 3 months after end of aquatic training: idem T1

        -  T4: 6 months after end of aquatic training: questionnaires

        -  T5: 1 year after end of aquatic training: questionnaires
