  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone fractures in traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients often heal faster
      than in other patients. However, such patients are also occasionally prone to bone formation
      in soft tissues such as muscle. This process is called heterotopic ossification and tends to
      occur around joints. Patients with heterotopic ossification often suffer from complications
      such nerve compression, ankylosis, chronic pain, osteoporosis, and infections. Loss of
      movement can also interfere with function and the quality of life of patients already
      experiencing difficulties associated with their trauma. Positioning, transfers, and hygiene
      become difficult and even impossible, which worsens the loss of autonomy.

      Previous research has suggested that an osteoinductive factor (which has the capacity to
      induce the formation of bone) may be released into the bloodstream following a head or spinal
      cord injury. The investigators laboratory has shown that a growth factor called BMP-9, when
      injected into a damaged mouse muscle, has the ability to cause strong ossification in damaged
      muscle. The investigators would like to find out whether the levels of BMP-9 and/or its
      receptor (which is called ALK1) increase after traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries that
      occur at the same time as serious orthopaedic traumas.

      The main goal of the investigators study is thus to determine whether BMP-9 levels increase
      in the serum of trauma patients.
