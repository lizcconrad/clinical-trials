      This is a scientific research study that will look at how a &quot;closed-loop&quot; system and the drug
      Pramlintide may work together to improve blood sugar control in people with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. Pramlintide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is given as
      an injection (subcutaneous) that works with insulin to lower blood sugar.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether standard pramlintide treatment plus a
      closed-loop insulin therapy is more efficacious in controlling glycemia than either of the
      individual therapies. The control algorithm is in effect an insulin dose calculator for
      mimicry of basal insulin secretion by estimating requirements for basal rates of insulin pump
      infusion based on current and past glucose levels estimated from the Continuous Glucose
      Monitor (CGM) device and prior insulin infusions. The closed-loop system-recommended insulin
      will replace (in a clinical setting) the basal rate insulin that the patient would normally
      use. The patients' meal insulin needs will be estimated using an insulin-to-carbohydrate
      ratio as per standard clinical practice and will be optimized prior to admission to the
      Clinical Research Unit.

      The primary goal of this feasibility study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of
      a closed loop system (Open-Loop Informed with a Model Predicted Control (MPC) algorithm plus
      a safety system module (SSM)) with pramlintide (a synthetic analog of the hormone amylin
      which in health is released by the β-cells along with insulin) treatment will improve glucose
      control versus each of the individual therapies. Because pramlintide reduces hyperglycemia
      extremes generated at meals and closed loop control markedly reduces the risk of
      hypoglycemia, thus representing potentially important complementary actions to reduced
      variability — the investigators expect to find decreased hyperglycemia while simultaneously
      decreasing hypoglycemia risks.

      Secondary goals are to explore factors associated with achieving safer and/or more effective
      closed loop control. For example, based upon our work in animal models, one secondary goal is
      to explore whether moderate inhibition of α-cell glucagon, known to occur with pramlintide
      administration in the early postprandial period, has the potential to repair inadequate
      glucagon counterregulation.

The primary outcome variable of glucose control within an American Diabetes Association (ADA) standard target range between 70 mg/dl to 180 mg/dl on a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) glucose analyzer. This is based upon the sample size estimate difference expected for % time within target range between artificial pancreas vs. patient control vs. Pramlintide plus artificial pancreas.</description>

    <description>Pramlintide will be provided to study subjects who will subsequently be admitted for inpatient testing with the closed loop system. The term closed loop refers to insulin adjustment automatically regulated by computer input to the insulin pump based on monitoring (often a combination of patient blood glucose (BG) testing and/or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)).</description>

    <description>This visit is necessary to assess how well the closed loop system works without the pramlintide (how well it protects from hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia). It will be the exact protocol as for the closed loop with pramlintide but without the medication.</description>
