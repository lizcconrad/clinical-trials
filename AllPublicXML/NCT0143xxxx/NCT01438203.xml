  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the comparative benefit of thrust and
      non-thrust manipulation on a population of patients with low back pain. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be no difference in 4 week outcomes or greater, between the two
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thrust manipulation is considered traditional spinal manipulation. Nonthrust manipulation is
      considered mobilization. The mobilization will be used in a similar manner as in clinical
      practice and this differs from past studies.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, age 18 and older, with mechanically producible low back pain, who attend
             care at a physical therapy outpatient setting, will be screened for eligibility for
             the study.

          -  For patients to meet inclusion requirements, they had to display a within session
             change in pain and/or range of motion during the assessment phase of the clinical
             examination. In other words, as the clinician performed their assessment and applied a
             passive accessory assessment technique, the pain and/or range of motion improved
             during that session, which suggests a favorable outcome using a comparable treatment
             technique. This is hallmark clinical finding in the patient response model and has
             been proposed as both a predictor of a positive outcome and as a prognostic variable
             toward long-term improvements in impairments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any red flags (i.e., tumor, metabolic diseases, RA, osteoporosis,
             prolonged history of steroid use, etc.)

          -  Signs consistent with nerve root compression (reproduction of low back or leg pain
             with straight leg raise at less than 45Â°

          -  Muscle weakness involving a major muscle group of the lower extremity,

          -  Diminished lower extremity muscle stretch reflex

          -  Diminished or absent sensation to pinprick in any lower extremity dermatome)

          -  Other exclusion criteria included prior surgery to the lumbar spine and current
             pregnancy
