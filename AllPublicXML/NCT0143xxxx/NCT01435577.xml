    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline value; up to 24 hours after first study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity assessed at predefined time points (at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours after first drug administration) over a 24 hour period using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of zero indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of ten indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Pain Intensity Differences at each predefined time point (calculated as post-baseline NRS values - baseline NRS values) were analyzed. Negative SPID24 values indicate a decrease in pain intensity and positive values indicate an increase in pain intensity since baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Pain Intensity Scores at Fixed Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; up to 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The mean pain intensity at fixed time points in the trial for all participants is listed. The pain intensity was measured using the Pain Intensity (PI). Pain intensity was assessed on 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity Differences at Fixed Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting at 15 minutes and up to 48 hours after first drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain Intensity Difference (PID) was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the first dose) and the pain intensity at the time. A negative number indicates a decrease in pain in the whole treatment group. The greater the negative pain intensity difference value the greater the pain relief in the treatment arm. A score of 0 indicates that there has been no change in pain in a treatment group. A positive value indicates an increase in pain in the treatment group.</description>

    <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain Intensity Difference (PID) was the difference between the PI after fixed times after first dose and the baseline PI (prior to the first dose). The Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 60 minutes was calculated.

    <description>Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is the metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that can be more easily or quickly removed from the body.

        <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain Intensity Difference (PID) was the difference between baseline pain intensity (prior to the first dose) and the pain intensity at the time. A negative number indicates a decrease in pain in the whole treatment group. The greater the negative pain intensity difference value the greater the pain relief in the treatment arm. A score of 0 indicates that there has been no change in pain in a treatment group. A positive value indicates an increase in pain in the treatment group.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences After 12 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain Intensity (PI) was assessed on 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain Intensity Difference (PID) was the difference between the PI after fixed times after first dose and the baseline PI (prior to the first dose). The Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 12 hours was calculated. If the values are negative (then the baseline pain intensity was greater than the pain intensity measured after dosing).</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic Concentrations of Tapentadol-O-glucuronide</title>
        <description>Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is the metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that can be more easily or quickly removed from the body. Tapentadol-O-glucuronide concentrations were measured in participants in the tapentadol treatment arm. Serum was analyzed by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 0.2 ng/mL.</description>

        <population>Participants in the placebo arm were not analyzed. Only those participants contributing data were analyzed. Participants that had an early second study drug administration were not part of the analysis.</population>
