      The open label extension study (Protocol C2/13/DR-6MP-02 EXT) is designed to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy and safety of 80 mg DR-6MP test formulation for an additional 12 weeks in
      subjects who already completed 12 weeks of Protocol C2/13/DR-6MP-02. Crohn's disease (CD)
      therapy is aimed at reducing inflammation via induction of remission after a flare-up and
      maintenance of the remission for as long as possible. The questions being asked in this
      extension study are:

        1. For subjects who received 80 mg DR-6MP for 12 weeks: Can the clinical efficacy and
           safety status achieved following 12 weeks of treatment be maintained or improved
           following an additional 12 weeks of DR-6MP treatment?

        2. For subjects who received oral Purinethol (1-1.5 mg/kg daily) for 12 weeks: Can the
           clinical efficacy and safety at 12 weeks be maintained or improved following the
           introduction of 12 weeks of 80 mg DR-6MP treatment?

      By following the 2 groups of subjects, i.e, those who originally received the test
      formulation (80 mg DR-6MP) and are now continuing for another 12 weeks on test drug vs. those
      who received the reference drug (Purinethol, 1-1.5 mg/kg daily) and are now being introduced
      to 12 weeks of 80 mg DR6MP test drug, and monitoring the CDAI scores, immunology parameters
      (ex. ESR and CRP) and safety assessments (i.e., adverse events occurrences, weight changes,
      laboratory test results) and comparing to the parameters at extension study start, the study
      will effectively answer the following questions:

        1. Does an additional 12 weeks of 80 mg DR6MP test drug treatment maintain or improve CDAI
           scores?

        2. Is an additional 12 weeks of 80 mg DR6MP test drug treatment safer due to negligible
           drug availability systemically?

        3. Can an additional 12 weeks of 80 mg DR6MP test drug treatment evoke a more effective
           immunological systemic response?

        4. In the subset of subjects willing to undergo colonoscopy/ileoscopy, does an additional
           12 weeks of 80 mg DR6MP test drug induce effective mucosal healing?

             contraceptive, partner's vasectomy, a double-protection method (condom or diaphragm
             with spermicide) or abstinence]

          4. Subjects with planned elective surgery or hospitalization during the course of the
             study (that may interfere with study compliance or outcome)

          5. Subjects who will be unavailable for the duration of the trial, are unable to comply
             with the planned schedule of study visits, are likely to be noncompliant with the
             protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the investigator for any other reason.
