  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease. Significant heterogeneity exists in the
      clinical manifestations and treatment responses in these patients. Metabolomics is a
      large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of the compounds involved in cellular
      processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles. Compared with genomics or
      proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in phenotype and therefore function. Up to now, few
      studies have evaluated the role of metabolomic analysis in the diagnosis and prognostic
      evaluation of airway disorders. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a newly
      developed, noninvasive method that may allow clinicians and researchers to assess biochemical
      profiles in the alveolar lining fluid. This study will apply metabolomics to examine the
      biomarkers in the EBCs, serum and urine specimens in adult asthmatics.

      The aims of this study are: 1. Metabolomic profiling of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC),
      serum and urine specimens in adult asthmatics; 2. Correlation between metabolomic profiles of
      these specimens with the severity and control of asthma; 3. Comparing metabolomic profiles in
      asthmatics with different phenotypes and endotypes; 4.Comparing metabolomic profiles obtained
      from asthmatics during stable and acute exacerbation periods; 5. Comparing metabolomic
      profiles in asthmatics before and after inhaled corticosteroid therapy.
