  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients attending the University Hospital Coventry UK with a broken wrist requiring an
      operation, will be invited to enter the study. At the first visit, they will have an xray of
      the wrist and will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires. The questions are to
      determine if they normally have pain in the wrist and how well they can perform their daily
      activities. The patient will then have an operation, and the fracture in the wrist will be
      held in the correct position with either a metal plate and screws or wires.

      At 6 weeks following the operation the patient will be reassessed and an xray will be taken.
      At 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the operation patients will perform tests to assess
      the strength of their grip, pinch and movement of their wrist. In addition they will complete
      the the same questionnaires from their first visit. At the 12 month visit patients will have
      another xray.

    <intervention_name>Kirschner wire fixation</intervention_name>
    <description>The wires are passed through the skin over the dorsal aspect of the distal radius and into the bone in order to hold the fracture in the correct (anatomical) position. The size and number of wires, the insertion technique and the configuration of wires will be left entirely to the discretion of the surgeon.
A plaster cast will be applied at the end of the procedure to supplement the wire fixation as per standard surgical practice. This cast holds the wrist still and is left on until the wires are removed at the follow-up appointment.</description>

    <description>The locking-plate is applied through an incision over the volar (palm) aspect of the wrist. The surgical approach, the type of plate and the number and configuration of screws will be left to the discretion of the surgeon. The screws in the distal portion of the bone will be fixed-angle, i.e. screwed into the plate, but this is standard technique for use of these plates. The type of proximal screw will be left to the discretion of the surgeon; these may be locking or non-locking screws. The use of a cast will left to the discretion of the surgeon.</description>

             fixation of the fracture
