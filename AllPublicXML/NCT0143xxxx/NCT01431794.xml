  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1/2 study that will combine the chemotherapy agents gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel with an oral hedgehog inhibitor LDE225. The objective is to assess
      tolerability and the resection rate of patients with borderline resectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma who use this treatment.

      The investigators propose treating 6-12 patients during the phase 1 portion and 40 patients
      in the phase 2 stage.

      Phase 1 Stage:

      1. Four cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 in
      combination with escalating doses of LDE-225. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the
      subjects will receive combined chemotherapy and radiation. Then subjects who are eligible for
      resection will go ahead with surgery. Following resection, subjects will complete two
      additional cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 in combination with
      LDE-225.

      Phase 2 Stage: In the Phase 2 stage the patients will be randomized to receive gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel with or without the hedgehog inhibitor LDE225:

        1. Arm A: Four cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m on days 1, 8
           and 15 in combination with LDE-225 at the recommended phase 2 dose.

        2. Arm B: Four cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m on days 1, 8
           and 15.

      After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the subjects will receive combined chemotherapy and
      radiation. Then subjects who are eligible for resection will go ahead with surgery. Following
      resection, subjects will complete two additional cycles of the pre-surgical therapy.

      Several correlative laboratory studies will be conducted during the course of this study.
      They were designed around the goals of providing us with a better understanding of how the
      stroma-tumor interaction and the intra-tumoral drug levels of gemcitabine are affected with
      the use of LDE-225. Two additional biopsies are required to participate in this study.
