  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estrogens are implicated in the development of ovarian cancer and estrogen receptors (ER)
      alpha and beta are present in 20-100% of ovarian cancer patients. For this reason,
      antihormonal therapy with anti-estrogens or ER-antagonists is potentially an attractive
      treatment option. However, only a small proportion of patients (5-19%) will respond to
      antihormonal therapy. ER-expression in ER-positive breast cancer can be assessed by positron
      emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES). In this study the investigators
      will evaluate whether FES-PET can be used to visualize and quantify ER-expression in ovarian
      cancer. If these results are positive, this would warrant further exploration of FES-PET
      imaging in ovarian cancer.

    <measure>The feasibility of FES-PET to visualize and quantify ER-positive lesions in epithelial ovarian cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Ovarian cancer patients planned for surgery or in which histology/cytology will be obtained, will undergo FES-PET/CT. FES-PET/CT will be qualitatively analyzed to determine whether ovarian cancer lesions can be visualized. FES-uptake will be quantified for all known lesions. Patient material will be stained for ER-expression to determine whether ER-positive metastases show FES-uptake.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between FES-PET and immunohistochemistry (IHC)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>FES-uptake will be calculated for each lesions. Quantitative FES-uptake will be correlated to semi-quantitative IHC-scoring for ER-alpha, ER-bèta, and progesterone receptor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concordance between CT-scan and FES-PET</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>CT-scan will be analyzed by a radiologist and lesions will classified into benign, equivocal and malignant lesions. FES-PET will be analyzed by a nuclear medicine physician and lesions will be classified. Concordance between FES-PET and CT-scan will be described. For discordant lesions, histology will be used as golden standard whenever available.</description>
