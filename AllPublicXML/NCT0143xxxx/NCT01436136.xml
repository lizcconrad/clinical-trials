    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study which follows two groups of participants over a 12 months period. One
      group will access a team approach to care with the aim of reducing their cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risks from a team of doctors, nurses and health care professionals. The other
      group will continue to access standard care from their treating doctor. Both groups will have
      CVD risk score evaluated after a 12 month period.

      The team care approach will involve specific tests to measure CVD risk as well as smoking
      cessation, exercise and dietary advice and support, including monitoring such as blood
      pressure and cholesterol levels
