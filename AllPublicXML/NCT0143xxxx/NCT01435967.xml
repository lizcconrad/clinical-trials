  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to monitor any impact in the change from the lyophilised formulation
      to the liquid formulation of the Rotarix™ vaccine on hospitalisations for rotavirus
      gastroenteritis. This is planned to be assessed by comparing trends of hospitalisations due
      to laboratory confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis in children &lt;=5 years of age, before and
      after introduction of the liquid formulation of the vaccine in Belgium.
