      This is a single-center (Emory University), open-label, single arm, phase I study to assess
      safety and toxicity of bortezomib in combination with bevacizumab and escalating doses of
      temozolomide for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Patients requiring
      anti-epileptic medications will have to be at least 10 days off EIAEDs. Only non-EIAEDs are
      accepted.

             of prior radiotherapy.

          6. Patients must be at least 10 days off any enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs
             (EIAEDs) of the cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine,
             phenobarbital.

          7. Karnofsky performance status score of 60 or more.

          8. Patients must have recovered from toxicity of prior therapy.

          9. Hematocrit &gt; 29%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,500 cells/microliter, platelets
             &gt; 125,000 cells/microliter for 14 days prior to treatment initiation.

         10. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and
             bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

         11. Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT INR) &lt; 1.4.

         12. An interval of at least 3 months from the completion of most recent radiation therapy.
             At least 4 weeks from a non-nitrosourea chemotherapy regimen and at least 6 weeks from
             a nitrosourea containing regimen.

         13. For patients on corticosteroids, they must have been on a stable dose for 1 week prior
             to entry if clinically recommended.

         14. May have up to three biological therapies.

         15. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

         16. Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

             the study.

             infection requiring IV antibiotics and psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements, or disorders associated with
             significant immunocompromised state.

          9. Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &lt; 20 mL/minute within 14
             days prior to treatment initiation.

         10. Patient has greater or equal to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before
             enrollment.

             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (Appendix), uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG
             abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

             (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

         14. Patient has received other investigational drugs within 14 days of treatment

         16. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy.
             Patients with prior malignancies must be disease free for at least 5 years.
