      RATIONALE: Continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis has important health consequences
      beyond the risks associated with smoking in the general population. Smoking reduces the
      efficacy of cancer treatments including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Despite the
      negative consequences, it is estimated that between 15-75% of patients with cancer continue
      to smoke after their cancer diagnosis. Lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, bladder, head &amp;
      neck, and cervical cancer patients were chosen because there is evidence of potential
      clinical benefit associated with quitting smoking in all of these populations and they
      represent a mix of both smoking and non-smoking related cancers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      * To assess the feasibility of delivering a Quitline based smoking cessation intervention to
      cancer patients in an outpatient setting. To achieve this, we will deliver the intervention
      to cancer patients in the surgery, radiation and medical oncology departments of
      participating Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) sites. Following the intervention,
      we will assess participant, CRA (Clinical Research Associate) Counselor and Quitline staff
      ratings of acceptability, resources required to deliver the intervention, protocol fidelity,
      and participant recruitment, retention and adherence.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain a preliminary estimate of the quit rate (as defined by 7-day point-prevalence
           abstinence) in intervention and control groups. To accomplish this aim, following the
           intervention we will collect confirmed smoking status data for intervention and control
           subjects. We will also obtain a preliminary estimate of the treatment effect (difference
           in quit rates between the two groups) and the standard deviation to better determine the
           sample size for a future trial.

        -  To evaluate primary patient reported outcomes, including quality of life (quantified by
           the FACT-G and for lung cancer patients only the FACT-L other concerns questions and the
           EORTC QLQ LC13), perceived life stress (quantified by the Perceived Stress Scale), and
           depression (quantified by the CESD-10), in cancer patients in the intervention and
           control groups.

        -  To refine the recruitment and intervention protocols using data collected from
           participants, Clinical Research Associate (CRA) Counselor, and Quitline staff to
           increase acceptability and improve retention in future trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to time since
      diagnosis (&lt; 3 months vs ≥ 3 months), treatment status (ongoing vs completed), and cigarette
      smoking (≤ 10 per day vs ≥ 11 per day). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (intervention): Participants receive a letter from their physician advising them
           to quit smoking, and undergo a 15-30-minute smoking-cessation counseling session by a
           trained research staff. During the counseling session, participants are educated and
           motivated about the importance of quitting smoking, and cancer-specific quitting issues
           such as managing the stressors associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. They are
           also told to expect a call from the Quitline in 2-3 days and receive a fact sheet about
           benefits of smoking cessation for cancer patients. Participants receive 8 weeks of
           nicotine replacement patches and up to 5 proactive telephone calls over a 12-week
           period. Calls are scheduled at convenient times for the participants and at
           relapse-sensitive intervals including; an initial planning and assessment call, a quit
           date call, a follow-up call 7 days after the participant's quit date, and 2 additional
           calls at 2-3-week intervals. Participants are also encouraged to utilize the Quit for
           Life Web Coach, an interactive web program application that guides them to build online
           quit plans, set quit dates, and track their progress toward quitting. Participants also
           learn behavioral tips and coping skills by interacting with others in topic-based
           discussion forums and community support programs.

        -  Arm II (standard of care): Participants receive a letter from their physician advising
           them to quit smoking, the importance of quitting smoking for cancer patients, and a copy
           of the National Cancer Institute's &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; smoking cessation booklet.
           Participants also receive standard of care from their oncology and other treatment
           providers which may or may not include nicotine replacement therapy.

      Participants on the intervention arm complete the Smoking Assessment, Smoking Cessation
      Self-Efficacy, the Brief Smoking Consequences, the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Lung Cancer (FACT-L), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
      (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire LC-13, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD-10 Depression), and the Follow up Smoking
      Assessment questionnaires at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

      Participants, on the intervention arm, undergo saliva sample collection at baseline and at 12
      and 24 weeks for cotinine level analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable cardiac disease - defined as congestive heart failure, unstable angina,
             serious arrhythmias, or Myocardial Infarction in the past month.

          2. Current use or planned use of varenicline (Chantix), Zyban, Buproprion or any other
             nicotinic receptor agonist (Patients that discontinue use of these type drugs within 7
             days are eligible.)

          3. Current probable alcohol abuse as defined by more than 5 drinks per day for men and 4
             drinks per day for women and a Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score

             If patient answers &quot;no&quot; to 5 drinks per day for men and 4 drinks per day for women the
             patient is eligible. AUDIT assessment does not need to be administered.

             If patient answers &quot;yes &quot; to 5 drinks per day for men and 4 drinks per day for women
             the AUDIT assessment must be administered. If AUDIT score is &gt; 8 patient is not
             eligible.

          4. Use of illegal drugs or use of prescription medications for non-medical reasons in the

          7. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to nicotine replacement therapy.

          8. Active Peptic Ulcer Disease

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing, psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         10. Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus, sexually active women of
             childbearing potential must use a reliable method of birth control while participating
             in this study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence (not having sex),
             oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or
             vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous
             relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable, method involves
             the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or
             sponge. We encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctors if you have
             any questions.

         11. If you are pregnant, should become pregnant or suspect you are pregnant prior to or
             while participating in this study, you should inform your study physician immediately.
             Nicotine replacement therapy has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects and is classified as a FDA Pregnancy category D drug. The U.S. Clinical
             Practice Guideline states that pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit without
             medication based on insufficient evidence of effectiveness and hypothetical concerns
             with safety. Pregnant women enrolled in the study and randomized to the Quitline group
             intervention should participate in the Quitline intervention but not receive the
             nicotine replacement therapy.

         12. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with nicotine replacement therapy, breastfeeding
             women are excluded from the study.
