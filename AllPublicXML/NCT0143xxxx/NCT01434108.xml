  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental drug to reduce plasma
      ammonia concentration at a dose that is safe and well tolerated. Ammonia usually rises
      significantly in the hours after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis of the
      liver. This increase in the concentration of ammonia facilitates the development of hepatic
      encephalopathy.

      The study will be divided in two parts:

      Part A: Open-label, dose-escalating, single cohort study. The goal of this phase is to
      confirm the tolerance and safety of the dose of OP that is being proposed for the study
      according to the results of phase I and phase II studies in healthy subjects and stable
      outpatients with cirrhosis.

      Part B: Multi-center (2 University Hospitals), double-blind, randomized, parallel-group
      trial. Assignment of treatment will be done according to a list (one at each study site) of
      random numbers in blocks that will be concealed until the end of the study. The control group
      will be assigned to placebo on a 1:1 ratio. The placebo and treatment will be masked.

    <measure>Ammonia plasma concentration umol/L.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Venous plasma ammonia will be assessed within 60 minutes of extraction in samples withdrawn every 12 hours during the first 48 hours and once a day during the second 72 hours. The concentration of ammonia will be used to decide: a)dose escalating in the initial phase (first 48 hours) of part A and b)discontinuation of treatment in the second phase (second 72 hours) of part B. Blood samples will be processed immediately after being withdrawn to separate plasma under cold conditions. Ammonia will be measured enzymatically in a Cobas Integra analyzer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          -  Cirrhosis of the liver; diagnosed by clinical, laboratory or radiological findings.

          -  Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as judged by clinical signs (hematemesis, melena,
             anemia) combined with endoscopic data.

          -  Bleeding that has been active within 24 hours prior to inclusion; signs of activity
             are defined by the presence of blood in the gastrointestinal tract and symptoms
             attributable to bleeding (hypotension, tachycardia, etc.).

          -  Age between 18 and 75 years.

          -  Informed consent by the patient. In case of inability to provide informed consent due
             to impaired mental status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy the informed consent
             should be provided by the next of kin and should be confirmed by the patient when
             he/she recovers from hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  Absence of exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Terminal illness (e.g. advanced hepatocellular carcinoma).

          -  Need for mechanical ventilation.

          -  Renal impairment, defined by a creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl or need of hemodialysis.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding. Pre-menopausal women capable of bearing children should be
             following a reliable method of birth control and should have a negative result in a
             pregnancy test prior to inclusion.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to ornithine or
             phenylacetate.

          -  Use of medications known to interfere with the clearance of either ornithine and/or
             phenylacetate, such as antibiotics of the penicillin group and probenicid.

          -  Use of medications that may induce hyperammonemia; such as haloperidol, valproic acid,
             and systemic corticosteroids.

          -  History or known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Neurological comorbidities that impair mental status and do not allow to adequately
             assess the presence or outcome of hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  The presence in the electrocardiogram of a QTcF &gt;500 msec
