  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug investigated in this study is Rivaroxaban, a novel, once-daily, oral anticoagulant
      for the prevention (prophylaxis) of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which may lead to a pulmonary
      embolism (PE) in people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of 2 immediate-release tablet
      treatments with Rivaroxaban: 2*5 mg tablets and 1*10 mg tablet will be given to healthy
      volunteers under fasting conditions; they will be administered as single oral doses in 2
      periods. Both periods will be separated by a 7-day washout phase. Thus, the bioequivalence
      represents the primary study objective. As a secondary objective, this treatment will be
      assessed in terms of safety and tolerability.

      Bioequivalence will be evaluated and verified on the basis of pharmacokinetic data. Blood
      samples of the volunteers will be taken at specific points in time; these samples will be
      analyzed using various statistical methods to establish pharmacokinetic characteristics
      required to compare the 2 treatments. The planned treatments with Rivaroxaban will be
      considered bioequivalent if specific criteria defined in the study protocol are met.

      The study will be conducted in one center in Germany. 28 subjects meeting the inclusion
      criteria will participate. They will be treated according to a single-dose, randomized, 2-way
      cross-over, non-placebo-controlled design.
