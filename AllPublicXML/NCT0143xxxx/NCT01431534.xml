    <textblock>
      This is a study to find a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for
      ridaforolimus given to participants between the ages of 6 and 17 years with advanced solid
      tumors.

      Study-related visits concluded in August 2013. Participants may continue treatment until they
      meet discontinuation criteria or voluntarily withdraw.

             for which no effective standard therapy is known. Patients who have received standard
             therapy and continue to have biopsy-proven residual stable disease are eligible

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease

          -  Must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Performance Status: Lansky Play Scale ≥70 for children &lt;10 years of age; Karnofsky
             score ≥70 for children ≥10 to &lt;16 years; or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Status 0-2 for patients age 16 and older

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  For females of reproductive potential, a negative pregnancy test must be documented
             within 72 hours of receiving the first dose of study medication

          -  Participants of reproductive potential must agree to use (or have their partner use)
             adequate contraception throughout the study, starting with Visit 1 through 30 days
             after the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents or using any investigational
             devices

          -  Leukemia

          -  Participant previously received ridaforolimus, rapamycin, or other rapamycin analogs

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ridaforolimus

          -  Persistent acute toxicity from previous therapy ≥Grade 2 (excluding alopecia,
             neuropathy, or hearing loss)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness despite adequate therapy

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Requirement for concurrent treatment with medications that are inducers or inhibitors
             of cytochrome P450 (CYP3A)
