      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Brief Motivational
      Intervention (BMI), in reducing alcohol consumption among patients with hazardous or harmful
      drinking admitted in emergency department (ED). Patients aged 16 to 24 and who tested
      positive for blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.5g/l. or above are enrolled.

      Patients receive either an information leaflet or an information leaflet plus a referral to a
      psychologist. BMI is provided by the psychologist. BMI consists in a first face-to-face
      interview (35-45 minutes) plus a telephone interview, at 1 and 2 months. Minors' parents are
      also invited to attend the BMI session. If necessary, patients can be referred to relevant
      care and treatment services for alcohol misuse.

      In a simple blind, randomised controlled clinical trial of 280 patients, 140 patients are
      allocated to the treatment group and 140 to the control group. Randomisation is stratified
      according to patient's age (16-17 or 18-24). Opaque and sealed randomized envelops are used
      for randomisation.

      Alcohol consumption is measured by self-report at 3 months. The principal criteria used to
      assess the reduction of alcohol use at 3 months follow-up is the number of alcoholic drinks
      in the last week. Other events such as ED readmission, quarrels related to alcohol, drinking
      and driving, sexual intercourse without protection will also be assessed. It is the first
      clinical trial in France comparing these two interventions among young patients in ED with
      this design.

      Eligible patients are recruited by ED physicians. Staff in ED involved in the study is
      provided with a teaching session on the importance of alcohol misuse and inclusion
      procedures. Prior to enrolment, a written informed consent is requested from every patient.
      For patients under 18, a consent form is also requested from parent(s) or the legal tutor.
