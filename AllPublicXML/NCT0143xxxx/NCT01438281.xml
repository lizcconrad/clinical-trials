    <description>Local tolerance and ocular surface (cornea and conjunctival) on the area of administration 24 hours after last administration. It will be performed using a slit lamp which will be performed before, during and after the administration at established times. Adverse events will be registered and the determination of subjective tolerance will use the visual analogical scale in cases where asubjects refers them</description>
