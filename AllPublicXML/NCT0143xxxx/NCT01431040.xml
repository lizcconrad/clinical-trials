  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative bowel preparation for surgical management of pelvic floor disorders is performed
      inconsistently, and includes no prep, the use of dietary changes or bowel altering
      interventions. Retrospective studies of emergency colonic surgery first demonstrated a low
      rate of infectious complications without a bowel prep. Recently, data supporting the routine
      use of mechanical cleansing for elective colorectal surgery has demonstrated the surgical
      outcomes are similar between patients that undergo a bowel preparation versus those that do
      not, indicating that the long held dogma of mechanical bowel preparation should be used
      selectively. Despite routine use, there is a paucity of literature addressing the approach
      to, and/or need for preoperative bowel management at the time of vaginal reconstructive or
      obliterative surgery. The majority of the pelvic floor disorder population is older, tending
      to have more bowel dysfunction (especially symptoms of constipation) than younger women.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate preoperative bowel management strategy as it relates to
      the total care of the vaginal surgery patients' intra-and post-operative bowel function and
      overall patient experience. Two commonly used pre-operative bowel prep strategies: no
      preoperative bowel prep versus clear fluids and 2-enema prep. The aim is to assess the value
      of bowel preparation or diet change in vaginal surgery, both from the physician's and
      patient's point of view. In this pilot study, subjects are randomized to either a clear
      liquid diet the day prior to surgery with 2 enemas and nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight,
      or NPO after midnight without any dietary changes or enemas.

      Our aims are:

      *Primary - To assess the surgeons' objective intraoperative evaluation of the effects of
      bowel preparation (adequate visualization, stooling during case, difficulty with bowel
      handling) *Secondary - (1)To characterize the patients' experience and acceptance of
      preoperative bowel management regimen versus no preoperative bowel preparation(2) To
      characterize the patients' postoperative experience and determine if the preoperative bowel
      regimen affects time to first bowel movement/first normal stool as well as stool experience
      as recorded by bowel diary (3)Evaluate the incidence of complications between the two groups
      (4)Characterize other descriptive qualities of the patients' operative experience(duration of
      case, length of hospital stay)

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be measured using the surgeon satisfaction questionnaire which is filled out immediately post-op. The surgeon assessment of the bowel preparation and its potential outcome on the surgical field (adequate visualization, stooling during case, and difficulty with bowel handling) will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bowel Diary and Bristol Stool Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be evaluated at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will receive 3 seven day bowel diaries,completing one week prior to surgery, and 2 weeks post-operatively. The Bristol Stool Scale is also included as part of the diary and participants are to record each bowel movement during the 3 week period. The information is returned to the physician at the post-operative visit, which occurs approximately 6 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <measure>Complications between the two groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be evaluated at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Any complications that arise will be assessed as they occur and the incidence of complications, if any between the two groups, including wound infection (as defined by erythema, purulent material that was treated with antibiotics, re-operation, or drainage), surgical site breakdown, bowel injury or other unintended injury of adjacent anatomy will be assessed after all the procedures are completed.</description>
