  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label study conducted in Japan and South Korea to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine monotherapy in subjects with newly diagnosed
      epilepsy and those with recurrent epilepsy (currently untreated).

      The study is composed of baseline, escalation phase, maintenance phase, taper phase and post
      study examination. During the escalation phase, the investigational product is administered
      orally at 25 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 50 mg/day for 2 weeks and finally 100 mg/day for 2
      weeks. During the maintenance phase, 200 mg/day is administered orally for 24 weeks. However,
      the dose can be decreased to 100 mg/day if there are safety concerns. Also, if it is
      confirmed that the seizures cannot be controlled at the dose of 200 mg/day, the dose can be
      gradually increased up to 400 mg/day by 50-100 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week. As a
      rule, lamotrigine should be administered once daily (in the evening), but the dose exceeding
      200 mg/day can be administered in two divided doses (in the morning and evening). After the
      completion of maintenance phase, Japanese subjects who have responded to lamotrigine without
      tolerability issues are eligible to enter an extension phase of the study if indicated, until
      either approval of this indication (monotherapy in epilepsy) or after 24 months after LSLV
      (Last Subject's Last Visit) of the maintenance phase, whichever is sooner.

    <description>Participants were considered to be seizure free if they did not report any seizures during the Maintenance Phase. Seizure types are defined as: ALL=any type of seizure; A: simple partial seizures, B: complex partial seizures; C: partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures; D5: tonic-clonic seizures. Simple partial seizures are seizures that affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. Complex partial seizures are epileptic seizures that are associated with bilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and cause impairment of awareness or responsiveness. Partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures are seizures that start as partial seizures, then spread to include the entire brain. Tonic-clonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that affects the entire brain.</description>

Simple partial seizures are seizures which affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi.

    <description>The time to the first seizure in the Maintenance Phase is measured at the time the first seizure occurred in the Maintenance Phase.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 70 participants were enrolled; 3 participants were screened but withdrew from the study before prescription of the first investigational product (67), and only 65 of the participants received at least one dose of the investigational product which comprised the safety population.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a 6-week Escalation Phase, a 24-week Maintenance Phase (MP), a &gt;=2-week Taper Phase, and a post-study examination conducted within 1-4 weeks after the last dose of lamotrigine. In Japan only, the Extension Phase was conducted until either approval for this indication or after 24 months after Last Subject Last Visit in the MP.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Lamotrigine</title>
          <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 25 milligrams per day (mg/day) was orally administered once daily (QD; in the evening [PM]) as the initial dose from Week (W) 1 to W2. As a fixed dose escalation, lamotrigine 50 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W3 to W4; 100 mg/day was administered from W5 to W6. In the MP, lamotrigine 200 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W7 to W30. The dose could have been decreased to 100 mg/day per safety concerns. Per investigator discretion, the investigational product was discontinued if safety concerns remained. If the 200 mg/day dose did not control seizures, the dose could have been increased up to 400 mg/day by 50-100 mg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals. A dose &gt;200 mg/day could have been administered in 2 divided doses (in the morning and PM). In the ExP, lamotrigine was administered at 100-400 mg/day based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;100 or &gt;400 mg/day was judged to be necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

          <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 25 milligrams per day (mg/day) was orally administered once daily (QD; in the evening [PM]) as the initial dose from Week (W) 1 to W2. As a fixed dose escalation, lamotrigine 50 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W3 to W4; 100 mg/day was administered from W5 to W6. In the MP, lamotrigine 200 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W7 to W30. The dose could have been decreased to 100 mg/day per safety concerns. Per investigator discretion, the investigational product was discontinued if safety concerns remained. If the 200 mg/day dose did not control seizures, the dose could have been increased up to 400 mg/day by 50-100 mg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals. A dose &gt;200 mg/day could have been administered in 2 divided doses (in the morning and PM). In the ExP, lamotrigine was administered at 100-400 mg/day based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;100 or &gt;400 mg/day was judged to be necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Seizure Free in the Maintenance Phase (Across Seizure Types and by Seizure Type Within 6 Months Prior to the Start of the Study)</title>
        <description>Participants were considered to be seizure free if they did not report any seizures during the Maintenance Phase. Seizure types are defined as: ALL=any type of seizure; A: simple partial seizures, B: complex partial seizures; C: partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures; D5: tonic-clonic seizures. Simple partial seizures are seizures that affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. Complex partial seizures are epileptic seizures that are associated with bilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and cause impairment of awareness or responsiveness. Partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures are seizures that start as partial seizures, then spread to include the entire brain. Tonic–clonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that affects the entire brain.</description>

        <description>Time to withdrawal is defined as the time from the start of treatment until withdrawal from the study. Seizure types are defined as: ALL=any type of seizure; A: simple partial seizures, B: complex partial seizures; C: partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures; D5: tonic-clonic seizures. Simple partial seizures are seizures which affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. Simple partial seizures are seizures that affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. Complex partial seizures are epileptic seizures that are associated with bilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and cause impairment of awareness or responsiveness. Partial seizures evolving to secondary generation seizures are seizures that start as partial seizures, then spread to include the entire brain. Tonic–clonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that affects the entire brain.</description>

            <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 25 milligrams per day (mg/day) was orally administered once daily (QD; in the evening [PM]) as the initial dose from Week (W) 1 to W2. As a fixed dose escalation, lamotrigine 50 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W3 to W4; 100 mg/day was administered from W5 to W6. In the MP, lamotrigine 200 mg/day was orally administered QD (in the PM) from W7 to W30. The dose could have been decreased to 100 mg/day per safety concerns. Per investigator discretion, the investigational product was discontinued if safety concerns remained. If the 200 mg/day dose did not control seizures, the dose could have been increased up to 400 mg/day by 50-100 mg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals. A dose &gt;200 mg/day could have been administered in 2 divided doses (in the morning and PM). In the ExP, lamotrigine was administered at 100-400 mg/day based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;100 or &gt;400 mg/day was judged to be necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>
