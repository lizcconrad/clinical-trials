      Background:

      Exercise is recommended as a cornerstone in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis together
      with medication. Last years, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in patient with
      inflammatory diseases is reported, probably caused by inflammation and increased prevalence
      of traditional risk factors. In both healthy adults and other patient groups,
      cardiorespiratory and muscular strength exercises have been shown to have a positive effect
      on inflammation as well as on cardiovascular risk factors. To our knowledge this has not been
      shown in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a cardiorespiratory and
      muscular strength exercise program on disease activity and cardiovascular risk factors in
      patients with ankylosing spondylitis

    <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP) will be used to assess disease activity. It is a continuous measure based on patient-reported outcomes (back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global assessment and peripheral join complaints) and CRP, and higher values indicate higher disease activity. The minimal clinically important improvement for this instrument is reported to be ∆ ≥1.1, and ∆ ≥2.0 is considered a major improvement.</description>

    <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed with an indirect maximal walking test on a treadmill for estimation of peak oxygen uptake according to modified Balke protocol. Hand grip strength will be assessed with GRIPPIT.

    <description>The exercise intervention will be carried out at a fitness center with supervision from a physiotherapist.
A cardiorespiratory and muscle strengthening exercise program following the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations for maintenance and improvement of physical fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness: two interval sessions (4 x 4 min), one continuous moderate exercise session (40 min) on a treadmill. The muscle strength exercises will consist of: 15-20 repetitions, large muscle groups as thighs, back and abdomen.
Dose: 12 weeks. Three times a week, 60 minutes.</description>
