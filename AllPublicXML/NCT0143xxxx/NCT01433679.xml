  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether rewarding physical activity with a
      motivational website will increase physical activity levels in middle school-aged children
      over six months. As a secondary outcome, the study also tests the intervention's impact on
      biological measures of inflammation and metabolic function in a sub-set of study participants
      who agree to provide blood samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is associated with a variety of positive health outcomes, as well as
      improved metabolic profiles and reduced inflammation. However, levels of moderate to vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA) diminish dramatically as children move into the middle school years.
      To address this problem, this study tests a behavioral intervention, called &quot;Zamzee,&quot;
      designed to motivate middle school-aged children to increase their levels of MVPA. The Zamzee
      intervention consists of a 3-axis accelerometer that tracks individual physical activity
      rates over time and a website that displays individual physical activity rates and provides
      rewards for maintaining or improving physical activity rates. The primary aim of this
      randomized, controlled trial is to test whether middle school-aged children randomly assigned
      to the Zamzee intervention will show significantly greater levels of physical activity levels
      over six months, compared with control group participants who wear the accelerometer but have
      no access to the rewards website. A secondary aim is to test the intervention's impact on
      biological parameters that may contribute to the long-term health effects of inactivity
      (including C-reactive protein as a measure of inflammation, and hemoglobin-A1C as a measure
      of metabolic status) in a sub-set of study participants who agree to provide blood samples.

    <description>The amount and intensity of physical activity is recorded continuously every study day that participants wear their accelerometer for the duration of the six month study.

    <description>In the subset of study participants who agree to provide blood samples, blood samples collected at study baseline and at the six month study completion will be assayed for measures of inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein) and metabolic function (e.g.,hemoglobin-A1C).</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the Website Intervention arm receive access to the motivational rewards website. The website displays the individual's physical activity data and allocates reward points based on the amount and intensity of physical activity. The website also allows reward points to be redeemed for various rewards such as gift cards to retail outlets, donations to charities, small tangible goods, and customization of participants' cartoon-like avatars on the website.</description>
