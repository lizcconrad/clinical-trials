  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the immune response activated in the human
      gastrointestinal tract by Trichuris Suis Ova (TSO) in patients with ulcerative colitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of helminthic therapy (using worms to treat diseases) is supported by experiments
      in mouse models as well as several clinical studies. TSO, which are purified eggs from the
      porcine whipworm Trichuris suis, are being investigated in clinical trials as a potential
      therapeutic agent for the treatment of active Crohn's disease, relapsing multiple sclerosis,
      peanut and tree nut allergy, and adults with autistic disorders.

      The goal of this study is to understand the immune mechanisms activated in the human
      gastrointestinal tract by treatment with TSO, which may lead to improvements in the symptoms
      of ulcerative colitis (UC). TSO have been shown to have a clinical benefit on a subset of
      patients with UC in a previous randomized placebo-controlled trial (Summers et al. 2005).
      However, the mechanisms of action of TSO on the intestinal mucosa remain unclear.

      We propose an exploratory 24-week mechanistic randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
      crossover study of TSO in patients with established and active UC to better characterize
      similarities and differences in the immune mechanisms of the intestinal mucosa in response to
      TSO. We hypothesize that treatment with TSO will lead to an anti-inflammatory immune response
      in some individuals with UC through an increase in intestinal mucus production and modulation
      of Th1, Th2, Th17, and T-regulatory effector lymphocyte populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be outpatients between the ages of 18 and 72.
