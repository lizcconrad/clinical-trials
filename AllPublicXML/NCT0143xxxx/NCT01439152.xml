          -  All subjects must be ≥ 18 years at the first screening examination / visit

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented invasive epithelial ovarian, primary
             peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (tumors with pseudomyxomatous or mucinous
             histology are excluded) or advanced predominantly epithelioid peritoneal mesothelioma.

             -- Ovarian cancer must have relapsed &gt;0 months and ≤ 12 months of the prior
             platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (platinum resistant and partially platinum
             sensitive).

          -  All patients must provide the tumor tissue sample [Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded
             (FFPE) slides] from archival tissue or fresh biopsy collected any time before the
             general screening under the separate informed consent.

          -  Mesothelin expression in the tumor tissue from archival or fresh biopsy samples
             defined as the membrane intensity score of 2+ or 3+ (on the 0-3 scale) expressed on at
             least 30% of tumor cells.

             -- Mesothelin expression must be determined by the validated Investigational Use Only
             (IUO) assay for ovarian cancer or the prototype immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for
             mesothelioma at Ventana at any time before the general screening in patients who had
             signed a separate informed consent for tumor tissue analysis for mesothelin
             expression.

          -  No more than 3 prior lines of systemic cytotoxic therapy for patients with advanced
             peritoneal or pleural mesothelioma or

          -  No more than 5 prior lines of systemic cytotoxic therapy for patients with ovarian
             cancer

          -  Possible intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxics during surgery will not count as
             systemic cytotoxic therapy in either case.

          -  Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             1.1.

        exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 5 prior lines of systemic cytotoxic therapy for patients with ovarian cancer

          -  Other systemic anticancer therapies (molecular-targeted, immunotherapy etc.) may be
             acceptable after the consultation between the Investigator and the Bayer Medical
             Expert.

          -  Intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic anticancer agents during tumor surgery
             will not count as systemic cytotoxic therapy in this context.

          -  Prior local radiotherapy is allowed if it is completed at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of study drug and the subject has evaluable lesions not previously
             irradiated.

          -  Anticancer chemotherapy, experimental cancer therapy, or immunotherapy within 2 weeks
             of start of first dose. Anticancer therapy is defined as any agent or combination of
             agents with clinically proven anti tumor activity administered by any route with the
             purpose of affecting the malignancy, either directly or indirectly, including
             palliative and therapeutic endpoints.

          -  Radiotherapy to the target lesions within 4 weeks prior to the first BAY94-9343
             infusion, if the subject has evaluable tumor lesions not previously irradiated.

          -  Use of strong inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (transporter) (P-gp) (e.g., ritonavir,
             cyclosporine, verapamil, and dronedarone) is prohibited from Day -14 and for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease [i.e., congestive
             heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV].

          -  Left ventriculat ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50 % [as measured at screening by Multiple
             Gated Acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram].

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management.

          -  Mild blurry vision, either age-related or due to ocular or systemic disorder (e.g.
             diabetes, dry eyes, cataracts, uncorrected refraction abnormality) may be allowed at
             the discretion of the ophthalmologist if deemed as no constituting a predisposition to
             drug-induced corneal deposits and blurry vision.
