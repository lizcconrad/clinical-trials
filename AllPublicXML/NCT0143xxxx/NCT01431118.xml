      The purpose of the study is:

        -  To investigate the effect of sport-specific stress in the iron metabolism of dragon boat
           athletes

        -  To investigate the effects of sport-specific stress in the activity of pro-hepcidin and
           hepcidin

      This investigation evaluates the effects of sport-specific stress in iron metabolism of
      dragon boat athletes. Recent studies showed a significant increase in hepcidin activity under
      exercise (Röcker L. et al.(2005): Iron regulatory protein hepcidin is increased in female
      athletes after a marathon. European Journal of Applied Physiology, S. 95, 569-571)which
      possibly influences the iron metabolism.

      In particular in this investigation the activity of pro-hepcidin and hepcidin under
      sport-specific stress is analysed. Therefore elite dragonboat athletes will be included to
      this study. Every athlete is tested once. At one exercise day from every athlete the iron
      metabolism especially the change of hepcidin, prohepcidin and iron before and after a
      specific dragonboat intervention is analysed.
