    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the combination of inhaled
      fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (100 mcg/25 mcg) once daily provides superior protection
      throughout the day against bronchoconstriction induced by exercise compared with fluticasone
      propionate 250 mcg twice daily in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 to 50 diagnosed with
      persistent asthma.
