    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study that aims to advance our knowledge on infantile onset
      FSHD. The study will include 50 participants of all ages who have presented with symptoms of
      FSHD between birth and 10 years of age. Study participation will involve a single day of
      assessments at one of the participating CINRG centers (to include physical exam, cognitive
      testing, eye exam, hearing test, strength testing and speech evaluations). The procedures may
      be split over additional days for scheduling purposes.

    <description>Establish a standardized muscle testing protocol including both manual and quantitative muscle testing as well as function testing for use in children and adults with infantile onset FSHD.
To describe the clinical phenotypes of infantile FSHD; separately in the early infantile group (onset before age 5) and late onset group (onset between 5 and 10 years of age).
To evaluate the impact of physical impairment, secondary health conditions, activity limitations and disability caused by FSHD on health-related quality of life and disability across different age groups; as well as to evaluate the utility of the FSHD clinical severity scale.
To evaluate potential genetic modifiers of clinical phenotypes and disease progression in infantile FSHD.</description>

        Individuals with infantile onset (diagnosed at birth until 10 years of age) and genetically
        confirmed FSHD will be recruited. This will include children and youth (less than 18 years
        old) with FSHD who are currently followed in pediatric neuromuscular centers, as well as
        adults (18 years or older) with FSHD who are identified as having infantile onset of
        disease by chart review, clinical exam, and genetic confirmation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Affected participants must have a clinical diagnosis of FSHD, including the presence of all
        of the following features based on review of medical records and/or direct examination:

          -  Onset of symptoms involving the facial or shoulder girdle muscles

          -  Autosomal dominant inheritance in familial cases

          -  Contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array from 1-10 (10 - 38 kb) copies in the 4q35
             subtelomeric region, based on established molecular genetic techniques

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or severe cardiac arrhythmia which may limit the ability to
             complete the study protocol

          -  Maternal/mitochondrial mode of inheritance

          -  Evidence of an alternative diagnosis based on muscle biopsy or other available
             investigations
