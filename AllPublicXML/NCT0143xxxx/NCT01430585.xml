  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-04691502 is an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR kinase. Published data support the hypothesis
      that a PI3K/mTOR antagonist in combination with letrozole might mitigate the intrinsic or
      acquired resistance to hormonal therapy and restore hormone sensitivity in high risk (high
      Ki-67) patient population of hormone-sensitive breast cancers. In addition, Ki-67, a marker
      of cellular proliferation, could be used to select those patients who benefit from treatment
      with a PI3K-pathway inhibitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was prematurely discontinued on 09Oct2012 due to the tolerability findings in 2
      clinical studies testing PF-04691502 that have prompted the Sponsor to re-evaluate the
      strategic goals of the program. In the study B1271003 an unexpected frequency of severe skin
      toxicity was observed and in the study B1271004 5 cases of drug induced pneumonitis were
      reported.

CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeter [mm]). No appearance of new lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions, using the short diameter in the sum for target nodes and the longest diameter in the sum for all other target lesions.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE: an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study treatment and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Objective Response (OR): Phase 1B and 2</title>
          <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeter [mm]). No appearance of new lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions, using the short diameter in the sum for target nodes and the longest diameter in the sum for all other target lesions.</description>
          <population>Data for phase 1B was reported in individual participant listings but not statistically summarized for analysis due to premature termination of the study. No participant was enrolled in phase 2 of the study.</population>
