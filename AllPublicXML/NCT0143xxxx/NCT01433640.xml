  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate 2D contrast-enhanced mammography image and 3D
      (tomosynthesis) contrast-enhanced images to contrast enhanced MRI in women with greater than
      95% probability of breast cancer (BIRADS 5) or confirmed breast cancer (BIRADS 6).This study
      will then be used to design additional studies.

    <measure>A PILOT study to determine Cancer lesion enhancement with CEM and CEBT is non-inferior to that of CEMRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>Fall 2012</time_frame>
    <description>This Pilot study is designed to evaluate two x-ray contrast methods with contrast enhanced MRI. Each subject will be imaged with CEM, CEBT and CEMRI. The goals for this will be to:
i) Using a Likert scale, Compare the enhancement of breast cancer lesions with CEM, CEBT and CEMRI.
ii) Using a Likert scale, Compare the enhancement of benign breast lesions with CEM, CEBT and CEMRI.
The results of this study will be used to design studies to measure the sensitivity and specificity of CEM and CEBT.</description>

    <time_frame>up to one year post study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Likert scale the CEM and the CBT images will be compared with standard pre-contrast mammography and tomosynthesis images to determine lesion conspicuity.</description>
