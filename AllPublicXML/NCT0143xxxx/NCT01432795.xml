  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical compression stockings are highly effective in the prevention, treatment, and
      secondary prevention of chronic venous insufficiency and of post-thrombotic syndrome.
      Non-adherence to the prescribed compression treatment concerns approximately 40% of patients.
      Elderly patients are often unable to handle stockings in order to put them on properly in the
      morning and to undress in the evening. Gliding aids and stocking &quot;butlers&quot; are two types of
      tools to facilitate the dressing manoeuvre with medical stockings.

      The present study evaluates four different gliding aids and two different stocking &quot;butlers&quot;
      to put on three different types of compression stockings. The study is conducted with forty
      consenting subjects with advanced chronic venous insufficiency.
