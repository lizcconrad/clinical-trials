    <textblock>
      The evaluation of a standardized diagnostic test to predict the growth response in a 1 year
      trial with Growth Hormone (GH) treatment (carried out in the context of regular patient care)
      in non GH deficient short children with low serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).

    <description>Doses in the diagnostic protocol are 0.7 and 1.4 mg/m2/day, injected by subcutaneous injection at bedtime for 2 weeks, divided by washout periods of preferably 4 weeks (accepted range 4-6 weeks). An additional period of 2 weeks on 2.8 mg/m2/day (after a washout period of 4-6 weeks) will be added if the IGF-I response on either dosage is insufficient (serum IGF-I SDS &lt;0).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 2.0 - 9.0 years for females, 2.0 - 10.0 yrs for males.

          -  Prepubertal stage (Tanner 1 for breast (B1) in females, or Tanner 1 for genitals (G1)
             for males).

          -  Bone age &lt; 10 'years' (males) or &lt; 9 'years' (females) according to Greulich and Pyle.
             The bone age will be read by the pediatric endocrinologist responsible for the
             pre-study screening visit.

          -  Height SDS &lt; -2.5 for ethnically adequate references. For children of Dutch or Western
             European origin the 1997 nation-wide references for Dutch children will be used. For
             children of Moroccan or Turkish origin, the respective reference charts will be used.
             For children of other ethnicities, the 1977 North American (NCHS/WHO) reference will
             be used, as these charts have been accepted by WHO as world-wide standard from the age
             of 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of hypersensitivity to growth hormone or phenol (conservative added to
             GH in NutropinAq), or drugs with a similar chemical structure.

          -  Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might jeopardise the subject's safety or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s)
             of the study.

          -  Has a birth weight and/or length below -2 SDS for Swedish reference charts. Patients
             will not be excluded due to an unknown birth weight or length.

          -  Has a known cause of short stature, or any significant concomitant disease that is
             likely to interfere with growth or with the study schedule/objectives, or is a known
             contraindication to GH treatment.
