  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic dysfunction refers to abnormal mechanical properties of the myocardium and includes
      abnormal LV diastolic distensibility, impaired filling and slow or delayed relaxation-
      regardless of whether the ejection fraction is normal or depressed and whether the patient is
      asymptomatic or symptomatic. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated high prevalence of
      diastolic heart failure (DHF). The quality of life of these patients is impaired and the
      clinical outcomes are similar to those with heart failure with systolic dysfunction.
      Therefore diastolic dysfunction has significant adverse economic impact that is expected to
      grow further with time. Clinical characteristics alone may not be sufficient to diagnose
      diastolic dysfunction. A number of invasive and non-invasive parameters have been proposed to
      diagnose diastolic dysfunction. Most of the presently used non-invasive parameters have a
      number of limitations. High fidelity measurement of the left ventricular pressures is needed
      to accurately diagnose diastolic dysfunction. Obtaining it in routine clinical practice is
      impractical.

      In this protocol the investigators have proposed a novel non-invasive parameter called
      'Torsional Hysteresis' as a measure of diastolic function. This will be measured using
      non-invasive cardiac MRI technique. During left ventricular contraction and relaxation,
      myocardium deforms. During cardiac cycle the myocardium goes back to baseline state prior to
      beginning of each contraction. However the rate with which it returns to the baseline state
      is variable. Torsion indicates relative wringing motion of the ventricle around a left
      ventricular axis and is a global parameter of left ventricular deformation. The parameters
      have defined a new parameter called torsional hysteresis based on non invasive cardiac MRI
      assessment. The parameters have hypothesized that for diastolic dysfunction, the torsional
      hysteresis area is increased as compared to no diastolic dysfunction group.
