      This study will be a non-randomized trial consisting of patients with single level (C3 to C7)
      symptomatic cervical disc disease who have not previously received fusion surgery at the same
      level, and have failed to improve with conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks prior to
      enrollment, or who present with progressive neurological symptoms or signs in the face of
      conservative treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The criteria for inclusion into the proposed clinical study are as follows:

          1. Age: 18-60 years of age (inclusive and skeletally mature);

          2. A diagnosis of symptomatic cervical disc disease, defined as image-confirmed
             pathology: herniated disc, spondylosis, and/or loss of disc height. Spondylosis is
             defined as image-confirmed disc desiccation, loss of disc height, bridging
             osteophytes, and/or uncovertebral arthrosis. Loss of disc height is specified as a
             measurement of at least 25 degrees less than an adjacent nonsymptomatic level, but
             with a minimum of 1mm height remaining;

          3. Functional neurological deficit (i.e., exhibits at least one sign associated with
             cervical level to be treated, including abnormal reflex, decreased motor strength,
             abnormal dermatome sensitivity, or pain in a dermatomal distribution);

          4. Symptomatic level is C3-4, C4-5, C5-6 or C6-7 (one level);

          5. Preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI) greater than 30 points (considered moderate
             disability; Vernon 1991);

          6. Unresponsive to conservative treatment for more than 6 weeks, and/or exhibits
             progressive symptoms and/or signs of nerve root and/or spinal cord compression in the
             face of conservative treatment;

          7. Not pregnant, nor interested in becoming pregnant within the follow-up period of the
             study;

          8. Willing and able to comply with the requirements defined in the protocol for the
             duration of the study;

          9. Signed and dated Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with the following characteristics will not be eligible for entry into the
        proposed study:

          1. Prior cervical fusion, prior laminectomy (prior cervical laminotomy that has not
             violated the facets need not be excluded), and/or prior cervical facetectomy at the
             operative level;

          2. Requiring surgical treatment that would leave the patient with a postoperative
             deficiency of the posterior elements;

          3. Signal changes in the cord on preoperative T2-weighted MRI and/or clinically
             significant myelopathy which would be described as gait disturbance, loss of manual
             dexterity, or bowel or bladder incontinence/retention.

          4. Radiographic signs of significant instability at operative level (greater than 3mm
             translation, greater than 11 degree rotation different from adjacent level);

          5. Bridging osteophytes or motion &lt; 3 degrees;

          6. Radiographic confirmation of significant facet joint disease or degeneration;

          7. Chronic neck or arm pain of unknown etiology;

          8. Cervical fracture, anatomic anomaly, or deformity (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis,
             scoliosis) at the levels to which the prosthesis will be attached;

          9. Severe spondylolisthesis (greater than grade 1);

         10. Endocrine disorders or connective tissue diseases;

         11. Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease;

             the following: inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma, corticosteroids, thyroid hormones,
             blood thinners (heparin, warfarin), gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for
             prostate cancer treatment, contraceptive medroxyprogesterone, lithium for bi-polar
             disorder treatment, anticonvulsants, aluminum-containing antacids, tetracycline;

         15. Osteoporosis to a degree that spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated (DEXA
             T-score less than or equal to -2.5; DEXA necessary only if patient exhibits risk
             factors for low bone mass as quantified in DEXA screening questionnaire);

         16. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin management;

         17. Presence of metastases or active spinal tumor malignancy;

         18. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40;

         19. Active local or systemic infection, including AIDS, hepatitis;

         20. Having been enrolled in another investigational device study within the last 90 days;

         21. Having had another cervical device implanted that would interfere with the surgical
             approach, study or control device, or follow-up evaluations;

         22. Demonstrates 3 or more signs of nonorganic behavior, such as Waddell's signs;

         23. History of substance abuse;

         24. Involved in spinal litigation;

         25. Mentally incompetent;
