      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the pain-relieving effect and safety of adding
      lidocaine hydrochloride to Restylane SubQ and to evaluate the esthetic improvement obtained.
      The study products will be administered in the cheek.

      The Restylane SubQ gel is intended to be used for facial tissue augmentation. The lidocaine
      content is designed to reduce the subject's pain during treatment. The objectives of this
      split-face designed study are to evaluate the pain-relieving effect and safety of adding
      lidocaine hydrochloride to Restylane SubQ and to evaluate the esthetic improvement obtained
      with the dermal filler using the global esthetic improvement scale (GEIS).

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Assessed Treatment With Restylane SubQ Lidocaine as Least Painful.</measure>
    <time_frame>When injection of both cheeks were completed</time_frame>
    <description>When injection of both cheeks was completed, the subject was asked which treatment was least painful (right cheek/left cheek/both cheeks alike).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Pain Assessment by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 15 and 120 Minutes After Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 and 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed during the first 2 hours after the initial injection of the study products using a 100 mm VAS. The endpoints of the scale were &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm) and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; (100 mm). Pain was assessed at the time points 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Improved Subjects at 2 Weeks After Treatment as Assessed by Use of Global Esthetic Improvement Scale (GEIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Esthetic improvement was evaluated by using Global Esthetic Improvement Scale. GEIS was evaluated by comparing current photos with pre-treatment photos and using a 5-graded scale (worse/no change/somewhat improved/much improved/very much improved). A clinically significant global esthetic improvement was defined as a score of somewhat improved, much improved or very much improved. GEIS was assessed by the Investigator and the subject. Each cheek/study product was evaluated separately. GEIS was assessed at the time points 2 weeks, 3 months, 2 weeks after re-treatment and 6, 9 and 12 months after first treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Step Improvement on Medicis Midface Volume Scale (MMVS) at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of midface volume loss or midface contour deficiency was assessed by the investigators using a 4-graded scale, Medicis Midface Volume Scale -MMVS (1, fairly full; 2, mild loss of fullness; 3, moderate loss, slight hollowing; and 4, substantial loss, clearly apparent hollowing). Each score were exemplified by photographic images on the scale. A one grade decrease in score from screening was defined as a treatment success/improvement.The efficacy in terms of Medicis Midface Volume Scale (MMVS) was assessed by the Investigator per treatment group. The two cheeks were evaluated separately. MMVS was assessed at the time points 2 weeks, 3 months, 2 weeks after re-treatment and 6, 9 and 12 months after first treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Diary Complaint Related to the Cheek Treated With Restylane SubQ and Restylane SubQ Lidocaine Respectively After Initial Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>A subject diary was completed for 14 days following the initial treatment and the optional re-treatment at the 3-month visit. Each subject was asked to record the presence of bruising, redness, swelling, pain, tenderness and itching.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) were collected by open questioning, information obtained from signs and symptoms detected during examination, observed by the study personnel or spontaneous reports from the subjects.
All subjects were injected with Restylane SubQ in one cheek and Restylane SubQ Lidocaine in the contralateral cheek.</description>

        <description>Pain was assessed during the first 2 hours after the initial injection of the study products using a 100 mm VAS. The endpoints of the scale were &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm) and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; (100 mm). Pain was assessed at the time points 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after injection.</description>

Half of the subjects received both study products by injections with a sharp needle and the other half received both study products by injection with a blunt ended microcannula. Following the initial treatment there was a one year follow-up period including an optional re-treatment at 3 months. A maximum volume of 2 ml per cheek and session was recommended.</description>

        <description>Esthetic improvement was evaluated by using Global Esthetic Improvement Scale. GEIS was evaluated by comparing current photos with pre-treatment photos and using a 5-graded scale (worse/no change/somewhat improved/much improved/very much improved). A clinically significant global esthetic improvement was defined as a score of somewhat improved, much improved or very much improved. GEIS was assessed by the Investigator and the subject. Each cheek/study product was evaluated separately. GEIS was assessed at the time points 2 weeks, 3 months, 2 weeks after re-treatment and 6, 9 and 12 months after first treatment.</description>

          <title>Restylane SubQ/Restylane SubQ Lidocaine: Systemic</title>
          <description>The study has a split-face design. Each subject was injected with Restylane SubQ in one cheek and Restylane SubQ Lidocaine in the contralateral cheek as randomized. Half of the subjects received both study products by injections with a sharp needle and the other half received both study products by injection with a blunt ended microcannula. Following the initial treatment there was a one year follow-up period including an optional re-treatment at 3 months. A maximum volume of 2 ml per cheek and session was recommended.Hence, all subjects received injections with both products at the same time.</description>
