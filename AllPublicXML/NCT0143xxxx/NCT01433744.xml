    <textblock>
      The hypotheses tested were that levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) would be higher in
      patients with chronic periodontitis in comparison with those without periodontal disease and
      that the non-surgical periodontal treatment would decrease levels of CRP in patients with
      chronic periodontitis.

    <description>Patients included in the test group were submitted to a non-surgical periodontal treatment protocol, which consisted of oral hygiene orientation and motivation followed by mechanical plaque control involving scaling and root planning using Gracey curets (Hu-Friedy Manufacturing, Chicago, IL, USA) and ultrasonic instrumentation (Cavitron Ultrasonics, Long Island City, NY, USA), under local anesthesia (Mepivacaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100000). The treatment was performed in one or two sessions depending on the extension of the patient's periodontal condition. Patients that presented teeth unreasonable to treat due to advanced periodontitis, or any other condition were extracted under local anesthesia.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients should have ≥ 20 teeth present; (ii) absence of oral soft tissue lesions; (iii)
        have ≤ 3 carious lesions in all teeth. In addition, to be included in the Test group the
        subject had to present chronic periodontitis (involvement of at least 5 teeth with at least
        one site presenting probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥ 3 mm)
        while to be included in the Control group the patient had to exhibit periodontal healthy
        (bleeding on probing (BOP) &lt; 30% of the sites and absence of any PD &gt; 4mm associated with
        BOP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (i) periodontal disease treatment in the previous six months; (ii) aged less than 35 years;
        (iii) systemic conditions such as history of CVD or any other chronic or immunologic
        diseases and the use of related drugs in the previous six months; (iv) smokers or former
        smokers; (v) pregnant or lactating women; (vi) hypertension (&gt;140 systolic and &gt; 90
        diastolic mmHg); (vii) obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²); (viii) levels of
        HDL-cholesterol &gt; 35.0 mg/dL (ix) levels of LDL-cholesterol &lt; 160.0 mg/dL (x)levels of
        triglycerides &lt; 400.0 mg/dL and (xi) levels of glucose levels &lt; 100 mg/dL.
