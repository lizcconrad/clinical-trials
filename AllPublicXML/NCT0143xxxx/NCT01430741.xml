    <textblock>
      A major goal for the Department of Veterans Affairs is to end Veteran homelessness by 2015.
      The VA's largest homelessness initiative is the joint Departments of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH), which has
      been expanded greatly over recent years via the allocation of 30,000 Housing First vouchers
      between 2008 and 2010 and increased funding to hire 1,000 new program case managers. However,
      recent expansion has resulted in a number of implementation challenges including delays in
      the distribution of housing vouchers and dropout among program participants (25% of those
      housed in HUD-VASH drop out within a year). Much of this dropout can be attributed to
      untreated issues facing many Veterans enrolled in HUD-VASH. The most common among these
      untreated issues are mental health and substance use disorders. The presence of these
      disorders is due in large part to the fact that much of HUD-VASH case management focuses on
      housing placement and maintenance, with limited attention to mental health, substance abuse,
      and other related psychosocial issues, which when left untreated, negatively impacts voucher
      distribution and housing stability. This project will test an implementation model-Getting To
      Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist in the delivery of an intervention for Veterans with
      co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH program.
      The proposed study will compare implementation of MISSION-Vet currently being planned through
      VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced approach using the GTO model. Thus, this
      project can contribute to ending all Veteran homelessness by 2015, a pledge made by President
      Obama.

    <textblock>
      This project tests an implementation platform-Getting To Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist in
      the delivery of an evidence-based intervention for Veterans with co-occurring mental health
      and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH program. This project will be a
      cluster randomized controlled trial that compares implementation of MISSION-Vet augmented by
      GTO to MISSION-Vet Implemented as Usual (IU) at three of the largest HUD-VASH programs in the
      country: VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System (Northampton, MA), VA Capitol
      Health Care Network (Washington, D.C.), and VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (Denver,
      CO). This project will randomly assign 150 HUD-VASH case managers and 1106 Veterans on their
      caseloads who have received HUD-VASH vouchers and case management services into these two
      groups on a 1-year rolling admission basis determined by when the Veteran receives a housing
      voucher. The control group will receive MISSION-Vet in addition to HUD-VASH case management
      services and the intervention group will receive the same as the control, however the
      HUD-VASH case manager will have access to GTO implementation support.

      To compare case managers implementing MISSION-Vet augmented with GTO to HUD-VASH case
      managers using IU strategies on the following variables: (1) fidelity to the MISSION-Vet
      intervention; (2) proportion of time the Veteran is housed; (3) mental health, substance use,
      and functional outcomes among Veterans; and (4) factors key to the successful deployment of a
      new treatment as specified by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, &amp;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) model.

      Data will be collected on fidelity to MISSION-Vet in both IU and GTO groups. Data will also
      be collected on all subjects' substance use, overall mental health functioning, engagement in
      substance abuse treatment services, the length of time housed, and community participation.
      The investigators will collect data from individuals at baseline and three time points for up
      to one year. The investigators' data analysis strategy will be to use a repeated-measures
      model to test for the significance of the treatment-by-time interaction while accounting for
      the clustered design of case manager within site.

      This study intends to serve a dual function of comparing implementation of MISSION-Vet
      currently being planned through VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced
      implementation approach using the GTO model. The proposed research will help to guide policy
      and practice actions to implement MISSION-Vet with fidelity and effectiveness to achieve
      maximum outcomes among homeless Veterans.

    <description>The fidelity index assesses the presence or absences of activities within MISSION-Vet - DRT, peer led sessions, self-guided exercises, referrals made, and/or delivery of the workbook, to each participating Veteran. We analyzed fidelity as the percent of adoption of MISSION-Vet. The threshold for fidelity to adopt MISSION-Vet is 1 contact between the case manager and each participating Veteran. There is no composite score, fidelity to MISSION-Vet is if the case manager conducted at least 1 session with a Veteran.This measure was embedded into the VA Electronic Medical Record System. The investigators will assess the impact GTO has in facilitating adoption and use with fidelity to the MISSION-Vet 12-month service delivery platform, in comparison to implementation as usual.</description>

    <description>GTO strengthens the knowledge, attitudes, and skills practitioners need to carry out evidence based programs. GTO consists of a series of steps practitioners should follow in order to obtain positive results and then provides them with the guidance necessary to complete those steps with quality. According to GTO, &quot;carrying out&quot; an evidence based program includes a series of steps corresponding to three general areas: (1) planning - e.g., developing goals and performance targets, ensuring staff are trained in the evidence based program; (2) implementation - e.g., monitoring program activities, maintaining adherence to an evidence based program model, supervision; and (3) self-evaluation - e.g., tracking patient outcomes, using data to improve program operations.</description>

        <description>The fidelity index assesses the presence or absences of activities within MISSION-Vet – DRT, peer led sessions, self-guided exercises, referrals made, and/or delivery of the workbook, to each participating Veteran. We analyzed fidelity as the percent of adoption of MISSION-Vet. The threshold for fidelity to adopt MISSION-Vet is 1 contact between the case manager and each participating Veteran. There is no composite score, fidelity to MISSION-Vet is if the case manager conducted at least 1 session with a Veteran.This measure was embedded into the VA Electronic Medical Record System. The investigators will assess the impact GTO has in facilitating adoption and use with fidelity to the MISSION-Vet 12-month service delivery platform, in comparison to implementation as usual.</description>

        <title>Number of Services Provided by Case Managers and Peers to Veterans</title>
        <description>Services provided by Case Managers OR Peers was computed by a count of the number of contacts between case managers OR peers and Veterans. This computed a total of all Veteran contacts, which was the sum of face-to-face contacts with Veterans and contacts on behalf of Veterans (described as Veteran contacts) with other stakeholders (e.g. family, medical providers). Assessed on a monthly basis for 12 months following study enrollment. These measures were obtained from the standardized monthly and quarterly status reports completed by case managers, which were extracted from HOMES. We used a linear-mixed effects model to calculate a Least-Squares Mean for each group at the study’s end-point holding all variables in the model (Veteran age, Veteran sex, presence of an SMI diagnosis, employment) constant at their mean value.</description>

These measures were obtained from the standardized monthly and quarterly status reports completed by case managers, which were extracted from HOMES. A dichotomous measure of whether a veteran experienced an inpatient hospitalization for medical or mental health conditions , and not a count of number of hospitalizations. Specifically, we used a mixed-effects logistic regression model to calculate a predicted values (i.e. a Least-Squares Mean) for each group/arm at the study’s end-point holding all variables in the model (Veteran age, Veteran sex, presence of an SMI diagnosis, employment) constant at their mean value.

        <description>We obtained information on negative housing exits from the HUD-VASH Exit form, which is available in HOMES and tracks the dates and reasons for all exits from the program. We measured whether and when a Veteran experienced a negative housing over the period from study enrollment (i.e. the first date of MISSION-Vet for those served by case managers in the GTO group and the date of the first MISSION-Vet session provided to any Veteran at the appropriate study site for this in the comparison group) until the end of the study observation period; the maximum follow-up time was 2.4 years, but only for HUD-VASH Exits. A negative exit was defined as an exit from HUD-VASH that occurred due to non-compliance with case management, eviction, Veteran dissatisfaction with housing, inability to locate Veteran and incarceration. Kaplan-Meier survival curves to calculate an estimate of the proportion of Veterans in each arm/group not experiencing a negative exit from housing at the study’s endpoint.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
