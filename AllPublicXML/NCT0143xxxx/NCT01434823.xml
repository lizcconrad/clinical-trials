  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical ICU (MICU) is implementing a model
      of 24-hour intensivist staffing in September 2011. Funds and resources are not available to
      cover the entire year, only certain weeks will be covered. The investigators propose a
      randomized clinical trial to study the comparative effectiveness of nocturnal intensivist
      staffing in the HUP MICU on patient outcomes. The investigators will be collecting and
      analyzing patient data of all patients admitted to the MICU from September 12, 2011, to
      September 11, 2012.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available evidence suggests that intensivist management of critically ill patients improves
      patient outcome, suggesting that greater intensivist coverage might be better still. However,
      the effects of 24-hour intensivist coverage in ICUs are unknown. In FY11, leadership of the
      Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) decided to roll-out a program for partial
      night-coverage of the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). In light of this natural
      experiment, the investigators propose to study the comparative effectiveness of nocturnal
      intensivist staffing in the HUP Medical Intensive Care Unit. To do so, the investigators
      propose a randomized clinical trial comparing the presence of a nocturnal intensivist
      (in-hospital call) to a traditional model of nocturnal coverage with an intensivist available
      by phone (home call) in the HUP MICU, with respect to patient-centered outcomes and resource
      utilization. The investigators will randomly assign seven consecutive days (Monday through
      Sunday) at a time to in-hospital or home call, in two-week blocks. The investigators will
      conduct primary analyses of all patients admitted during night hours and secondary analyses
      of various subgroups of patients admitted during night hours as well as all patients admitted
      during any time of day during the study period from September, 2011, to June, 2011.

      A sub-study designed to measure sleep and work duration, sleepiness, and attention in Daytime
      Intensivists (faculty and fellows) during their medical ICU rotation will be conducted. The
      variables measured will be compared between periods with and without in-house nocturnal
      intensivist staffing. All fellows and faculty who rotate through the medical ICU during this
      study period, Jan 2012 to Dec 2012 will be approached for possible recruitment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, 18 years and older, who are admitted to the HUP MICU during the 12-month
             study period will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No patients who meet these inclusion criteria will be excluded from this study.

          -  For patients admitted more than once to the MICU during the same hospitalization, we
             will include only their first admission to the MICU for all analyses.

          -  Subjects under 18 are very rarely seen at the HUP MICU because they are generally
             treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

          -  In the rare event that a subject under the age of 18 receives care in the MICU his or
             her data will be excluded from this study.

        For the Intensivist Sleep and Work sub-study looking at sleep, work hours, and attention of
        Daytime Intensivists during their MICU rotations:

          -  All University of Pennsylvania faculty members and fellows from the Division of
             Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care will be eligible for inclusion in the study if
             they rotate through the MICU during the study period (January, 2012 through December,
             2012).

        Exclusion Criteria:

      <pre_assignment_details>Exclusions included patients who were readmitted to the ICU within the same hospitalization (we included their first ICU admission), patients who were admitted during the holiday block (no nighttime coverage), and patients who had ICU stays so brief they were either were not exposed to nighttime hours or ineligible for APACHE score calculation.</pre_assignment_details>

Nocturnal coverage: The investigators will randomize, by week, nocturnal coverage. During the intervention weeks, intensivists will be in the MICU from 7pm until 7am.
For the Intensivist Sleep and Work sub-study:
Measurements of Daytime Intensivist work hours, sleep, and attention will be measured with actigraphy, PVT, Sleep and Work Diaries, and Surveys. Results will be compared between periods with standard staffing to periods with overnight intensivist coverage.</description>
