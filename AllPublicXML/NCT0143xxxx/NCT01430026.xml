      The propose of this study to determine efficacy and complication of gentamicin nasal
      irrigation in chronic rhinosinusitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by symptoms &gt; 12 weeks

      Two or more symptoms one of which should be either nasal blockage /obstruction/congestion or
      nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip):

        -  facial pain/pressure

        -  reduction or loss of smell)

      Mainstay of treatment are medical and surgical treatment ( ATB, adenoidectomy, ESS)
      Adjunctive treatment : normal saline nasal irrigation, nasal corticosteroids, nasal
      decongestants, mucolytics Topical antibiotic therapy in patients with refractory sinusitis
      has been shown to improve symptoms, quality of life, and mucosal aspect Nasal lavage with
      Mupirocin represent an effective and well tolerated alternative treatment of surgically
      recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis

      In pediatrics allergy clinic at Siriraj hospital since 2006 use Gentamicin nasal irrigation
      for chronic rhinosinusitis.There have been no studies in gentamicin irrigation in chronic
      rhinosinusitis. The aims of this study are to evaluate:

        1. Efficacy of gentamicin nasal irrigation in chronic rhinosinusitis (outcomes: frequency
           of sinusitis, frequency of antibiotic usage)

        2. Complication of gentamicin nasal irrigation usage
