      Background:

      - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best disease), Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) all affect the retina, the light sensing area at the
      back of the eye. Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases. However,
      cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research. Researchers
      want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells
      with those of healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the
      retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD in at least
           one eye.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history. They will also
           have an eye exam.

        -  Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy. The hair
           will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the
           inside of the upper arm.

      This study will establish a repository of biospecimens to generate induced pluripotent stem
      (iPS) cells, which will be used to determine molecular mechanisms for the following
      potentially blinding eye diseases: Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best Disease); Late-Onset
      Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD); Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD); Leber congenital
      amaurosis (LCA); Joubert syndrome; X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP); oculocutaneous
      albinism,Stargardt s with ABCA4 gene mutations; Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, Enhanced
      S-Cone syndrome (ESCS), Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 7 (SCA7) and eye diseases associated
      with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations. Skin fibroblasts, hair keratinocytes, and/or blood
      cells may be collected from participants with retinal diseases and from age, gender and
      ethnicity-matched healthy participants.

      Although research involving multiple different ocular cell types from these patients may be
      performed, the vast majority of the work will be centered on the retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE) and neural retina. RPE and/or neural retinal cells generated from the iPS cells of
      participants with retinal diseases and healthy volunteers will be used to analyze molecular
      mechanisms involved in disease initiation and progression. In addition, the iPS cell-derived
      ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens aimed at suppressing
      the molecular phenotypes of the disease and to identify potential therapeutic agents for
      these diseases.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to generate participant-iPS cells that can
      be differentiated into ocular cell types, to be used to study the molecular mechanisms of and
      to develop treatments for Best disease, L-ORD, AMD, LCA, Joubert syndrome, X-linked RP, OCA,
      Startgardt s disease, Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, ESCS, SCA7 and eye diseases associated
      with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations. This objective will be carried out in three phases.
      First, this study will establish a repository of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and/or blood
      cells collected from participants with eye diseases and from matched controls without any eye
      diseases. Second, the somatic cell repository will be used to generate iPS cells, which will
      be differentiated into RPE, neural retinal and/or other ocular cells. These cells will be
      used to elucidate molecular pathways that have led to disease pathogenesis. In the third
      phase, the participant-specific ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput drug
      screens to identify novel potential therapeutic compounds. The cells obtained in this
      protocol may be genetically modified and may be transplanted into animals in the laboratory.

      Study Population: We plan to recruit 25 participants with Best disease, 25 participants with
      L-ORD, 100 participants with AMD, 35 participants with early onset retinal degeneration
      and/or LCA, 25 participants with Joubert syndrome, 25 participants with X-linked RP, 50 with
      OCA, 25 with Stargardt s disease with ABCA4 mutations, 25 with eye diseases due to MITF
      mutations, 25 with Waardenburg syndrome, 25 with eye diseases due to PAX2 mutations, 25 with
      eye diseases due to PAX6 mutations, 25 participants with coloboma, 5 participants with ESCS
      without macular edema, 25 participants with SCA7, and 465 healthy volunteers without any eye
      disease. If possible, unaffected siblings and relatives of participants with eye diseases
      will be included as healthy volunteers.

      Design:In this basic science, research-oriented study, skin, hair, and/or blood samples may
      be collected from affected participants with the eye diseases and/or genetic mutations under
      study, and from control participants matched for age, gender and ethnicity. The sample
      collection procedures will incur only minimal risk to adult participants. For on-site minor
      participants, the skin biopsy procedure is a minor increment over minimal risk. Offsite minor
      participants will not undergo the skin biopsy.This study will typically require only one
      visit by each participant. Participants may be requested to return if their initial sample(s)
      did not produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory. Participants who were previously
      enrolled to provide samples for research-grade iPS cell generation may return for an
      additional visit to provide samples for clinical-grade iPS cell generation, if eligible. The
      skin fibroblast, keratinocyte, and/or blood samples will then be used to generate
      participant-specific iPS cells, and these cells will then be differentiated into RPE, neural
      retinal and/or other ocular cell types. iPS cells may not be made from all samples. The
      investigators will use the samples for research studies aimed at identifying molecular and
      signaling pathways underlying disease onset and progression and for developing potential
      therapeutic treatments for the eye diseases under study.

      Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study include the creation of iPS cells from
      at least one of the three types of somatic tissues collected from each participant, the
      differentiation of iPS cells into RPE, neural retinal cells and/or other ocular cells, and
      the identification of molecular and physiological phenotypes in these cells that may be
      linked to the onset or progression of Best disease, L-ORD, AMD, LCA, Joubert syndrome,
      X-linked RP, OCA, Stargardt s disease, Waardenburg syndrome, coloboma, ESCS, SCA7and eye
      diseases due to MITF, PAX2, and PAX6 mutations. This analysis may lead to the discovery of
      therapeutic interventions for these diseases. There are no specific participant-based
      clinical outcomes for this protocol. Participants will, in general, be seen only once for
      this protocol, as they will be ascertained and/or receiving standard care under the NEI
      Evaluation and Treatment Protocol (08-EI-0169) or other NEI protocols. In rare cases,
      participants may be requested to return to the clinic if their initial sample(s) did not
      produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory.
