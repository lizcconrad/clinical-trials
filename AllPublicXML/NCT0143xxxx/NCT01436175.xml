    <textblock>
      This study is an optional continuation of previous short-term adult major depressive disorder
      (MDD) augmentation studies. Patients may only take part in this long-term, open-label
      research study if they completed a previous double-blind MDD augmentation study using SPD489.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    SPD489 failed to demonstrate a benefit as adjunctive treatment to antidepressants. Termination
    was not related to any new safety findings.

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 up to Week 52/Early Termination(ET)</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviour during the assessment period. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The assessment is done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale.</description>

        <description>C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviour during the assessment period. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The assessment is done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF is a 16-item self-report questionnaire which evaluates general participant satisfaction with health, mood, relationships, functioning in daily life, and their treatment. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The total raw score (summary scale score) was calculated by summing item scores 1 to 14 (total raw score range: 14 to 70). Item 15 (satisfaction with medication, raw score range: 1 to 5) and Item 16 (overall satisfaction and contentment; raw score range: 1 to 5) were stand-alone items. For reporting, summary scale, Item 15 and Item 16 raw scores were transformed into percentage maximum possible score which ranged from 0 to 100, where higher scores are indicative of greater enjoyment or satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire - 14 Item Scale (CSFQ-14) Total Score at Week 52/ET</title>
        <description>CSFQ-14 is a 14 item self-report tool that evaluates sexual functioning. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always) with total scores ranging from 14 to 70. Higher scores reflect better sexual functioning. Baseline was defined as the Augmentation Baseline Visit of the antecedent study (SPD489-209 [NCT01435759], SPD489-322 [NCT01436149], and SPD489-323 [NCT01436162]).</description>

1. Were you hospitalized in the past month, 2. Do you work for pay, 3. If you missed time at work last week, please note all the reasons why, 4. Would you say that the past week was typical, like the rest of the 3 weeks this month, in terms of your working hours, 5. Do you do volunteer work (VW), and 6. If you do not receive money for your work and do not participate in volunteer work, the reason is.

        <description>The PRUQ-MDD assessed the long term economic outcomes. It collects utilization of healthcare resources reported by the study participants. Participants answered following questions – 1. How many times did you visit the following healthcare providers in the past month: Family doctor/primary care, Non-physician healthcare practitioner (NPHP), Psychiatrist/Psychologist/Counselor (PPC); 2. How many times did you take one of the tests, mentioned below, during the past month: Blood test, CT Scan, X Ray, Renal function, Thyroid function; and 3. How many times did you visit the hospital emergency room (ER), urgent care facility (UCF) or an after-hours clinic (AHC) in the past month. Number of events (visit to health care provider, visit to hospital facilities, and number of times a test was performed) are reported.</description>
