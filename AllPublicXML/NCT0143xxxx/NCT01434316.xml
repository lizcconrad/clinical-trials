      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib and dinaciclib in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Veliparib and dinaciclib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABT-888 (veliparib) and SCH727965 (dinaciclib)
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for ABT-888 in combination with
      SCH727965, determined by evaluating the feasibility, safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and
      the maximally tolerated dose(s).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the safety of the combination of ABT-888 and SCH727965 in patients with known
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888 both alone and in combination
      with SCH727965.

      III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of ABT-888 in combination with SCH727965, both in
      surrogate tissues and in tumor.

      IV. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of the ABT-888/SCH727965 combinations in
      subjects with solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib and dinaciclib followed by expanded
      doublet cohort studies of non-breast BRCA-proficient patients and BRCA-proficient triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, a safety doublet cohort for BRCA-deficient patients,
      and cohorts of BRCA-associated TNBC (PARP inhibitor-naive and PARP inhibitor-resistant).

      PART 1A: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and dinaciclib
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 8 and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART 1B: Patients receive veliparib and dinaciclib as patients in Part 1A. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART 1C: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7 of course 0. Patients then receive
      veliparib PO BID on days 1-21 and dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 or days
      1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
