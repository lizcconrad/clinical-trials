  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      DFRF4539A in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Cohorts of patients will
      receive multiple ascending doses of intravenous DFRF4539A every 3 weeks or weekly. Patients
      exhibiting acceptable safety and evidence of clinical benefit may receive DFRF4539A for up to
      17 cycles. Anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year or until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs.
