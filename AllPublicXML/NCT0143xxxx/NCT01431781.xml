    <textblock>
      Pancreatitis are one of the most common complications of post-ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde
      Cholangiopancreatography), the incidence rate is 5&amp;-10%, how to prevent PEP and
      hyperamylasemia is an important issue, somatostatin is widely used in the field of pancreas
      treatment. In order to explore the effects of somatostatin on prevent PEP(post-ERCP
      Pancreatitis), 908 subjects will be enrolled in two group in the study, one group is given
      common treatment, the other uses somatostatin in the base of common treatment.

      A prospective, multi-center, investigator sponsored, randomized controlled trial, 15 sites
      join in in China, 908 subjects will be enrolled.

      A descriptive analysis will be performed on primary endpoint, containing frequency of number
      and percentage of patients. A two proportion equality test will be conducted to explore
      whether incidence rates are different.

      Descriptive statistics including number (N), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and
      maximum, will be produced for all continuous variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and
      percentage of subjects will be produced for all categorical variables.
