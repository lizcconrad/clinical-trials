  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to replicate previous findings that sleep deprivation results in
      marked improvement in depression symptoms, as well as to test whether concurrent treatment
      with Light Therapy and Lithium are successful in locking in and maintaining therapeutic
      effects in both bipolar and unipolar depressed subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both refractory depression and bipolar depression are difficult to treat. A night of complete
      sleep deprivation has been shown to result in marked improvement in 60% of depressed
      patients, although maintenance of therapeutic effects have not been sustained with wake
      therapy alone. This pilot study will assess the effectiveness of wake therapy in treating
      both bipolar depression (5 participants)and major depression (5 participants), as well as the
      effectiveness of concomitant light therapy and lithium in maintaining the therapeutic
      effects. Participants will undergo direct observation in the hospital for one week during
      initial treatment with alternating nights of sleep deprivation, light therapy and lithium
      treatment, and then will be seen weekly as outpatients for 6 weeks.

    <measure>Structured Interview for the Hamilton Depression Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement(SIGH-ADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a structured interview to obtain Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ratings, with additional items added to measure reverse vegetative features common in bipolar depression and depression with atypical features</description>

    <measure>Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ),</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a standard self-report instrument for measuring the extent to which an individual is an &quot;early bird&quot; vs. a &quot;night owl,&quot; asking a variety of questions concerning the time of day individuals prefer engagement in various activities. Scores correlate highly with biologic measures of circadian rhythm phase and will be used to custom program the timing of each patient's light therapy and habitual sleep</description>

    <measure>Symptom Check List (SCL-90)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This a standard listing covering most major categories of psychiatric symptoms. It allows measurement not only of depressive symptoms over time, but also other common symptoms, such as those of panic attacks or other anxiety disorders</description>

    <description>This is a standard measure of the clinician's overall impression of how the patient is doing. It includes two measurements, one for the patient's severity of overall symptomatology, and the other for improvement since starting treatment.</description>
