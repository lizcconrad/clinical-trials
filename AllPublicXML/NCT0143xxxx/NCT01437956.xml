  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum KL-6 protein has been described as a biomarker of epithelial lung injury in Respiratory
      Syncytial Virus bronchiolitis. The investigators can imagine that epithelial injury intensity
      has consequences on immediate and later respiratory prognosis. Furthermore, this prognosis
      seems to be different according to the respiratory causative virus. The investigators propose
      to study, during an epidemic season, the correlation between KL-6 levels and clinical
      severity, and the type of viral infection.

      Prospective, monocentric, case-control and transversal study Primary end-point: correlation
      between serum KL-6 level and severity of the bronchiolitis, evaluated by a clinical scoring
      system established at the time of the admission in Paediatric Emergency Unit Secondary
      end-points: respiratory virus detected by EIA and RT-PCR, phylogenetic study of rhinovirus,
      length of hospitalisation, immediate morbidity and mortality, risk of asthma at the age of
      three years old.
