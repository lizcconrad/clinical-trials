  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery rates are increasing in Turkey and a major component of this increase is
      cesarean on demand. Although data on the rate of cesarean delivery in Turkey is limited, a
      national study reported a rate of 23.8%. Infectious morbidity, consisting primarily of
      endomyometritis and wound infection, remains a leading cause of postoperative complications.
      Estimates of postcesarean infection rates range from 7% to 20%, depending on demographic and
      obstetric variables. Infection following cesarean delivery results in not only increased
      hospital stay but also increases the cost of care. Strategies to minimize postoperative
      infectious and other morbidities have included modifications of surgical technique, changing
      of gloves, methods of placental delivery, cervical dilatation during cesarean delivery, and
      altering the uterine position during repair of the uterine incision. Despite these
      interventions, endometritis is still major problem after cesarean delivery.

      Endometritis appears to result from ascending vaginal flora bacteria, with anaerobes playing
      an important role. The microbes endogenous to the vagina change throughout the course of
      pregnancy and parturition. Larsen and Galask noted that anaerobic species located in the
      vagina increase dramatically by the third postpartum day. In many cases, the surgeon's hand,
      reaching below the infant's head or presenting part, is in direct contact with the vagina.
      Vaginal bacterial flora have been cultured from the delivering surgeon's glove in 79% (95%
      confidence interval [CI] 58%, 100%) of cesareans that follow labor. In these cases, vaginal
      flora are delivered directly to the uterus, abdominal cavity, and the abdominal incision.
      Vaginal preparation has been shown to decrease the quantitative load of vaginal
      microorganisms as well as to remove certain species of bacteria.
