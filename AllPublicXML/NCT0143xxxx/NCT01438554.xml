  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of
      pazopanib and GSK1120212 in patients with solid tumors and identify the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of this combination for phase II study.

             have not responded to treatment with radioactive iodine.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;3 months.
