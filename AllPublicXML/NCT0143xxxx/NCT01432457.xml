    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item Total Score (HAM-D17) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8 (final on-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. Change from baseline: score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

    <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8 (final on-therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASEX scale has 5 items to assess sexual functioning with a 1-week recall period. The 5 items assess sex drive, ease of arousal, ease of erection/lubrication, ease of orgasm and orgasm satisfaction. Subjects were encouraged to complete all 5 items regardless of sexual activity during the past week. However, all analyses utilized only the data for the visits where the presence of sexual activity was indicated.
Each individual score ranged from 1 to 6; the total score (based on the sum of the individual items) ranged from 5 to 30; higher scores indicated worse sexual function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item Total Score (HAM-D17) at Week 8</title>
        <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. Change from baseline: score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item (HAM-D17) Response Rate</title>
        <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score.</description>

          <title>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item (HAM-D17) Response Rate</title>
          <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression (symptoms such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels, and weight loss). Each item is scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), for a maximum total score of 52; higher scores indicate more depression. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score.</description>

        <description>The ASEX scale has 5 items to assess sexual functioning with a 1-week recall period. The 5 items assess sex drive, ease of arousal, ease of erection/lubrication, ease of orgasm and orgasm satisfaction. Subjects were encouraged to complete all 5 items regardless of sexual activity during the past week. However, all analyses utilized only the data for the visits where the presence of sexual activity was indicated.
Each individual score ranged from 1 to 6; the total score (based on the sum of the individual items) ranged from 5 to 30; higher scores indicated worse sexual function.</description>
