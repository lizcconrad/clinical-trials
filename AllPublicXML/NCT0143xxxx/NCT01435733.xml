      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the presence of a child with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder places parents at increased risk for divorce.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders involving a triad
      of impairments in communication and social reciprocity and increases in repetitive/restricted
      interests and behaviors. ASD includes: autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive
      developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett's syndrome, and childhood
      disintegrative disorder as pervasive developmental disorders (American Psychiatric
      Association [DSM-IV-TR], 2000).

      Few disabilities appear to be more taxing on parents than ASDs.Parents of children with ASD
      fare worse on a variety of measures of well-being than parents of children without
      disabilities as well as parents of children with other types of disabilities.

      Studies investigating the impact of a child with disabilities, specifically ASD, are
      inconclusive. However, parents of children with ASD may be at increased risk for divorce due
      to a variety of personal and disability related factors. In Israel the relationship of having
      a child with autism on the probability of divorce has not been tested yet. The aim of this
      study is to profile this relationship and determine the magnitude and directionality of the
      effect raising ASD children has on the resilience of the institution of marriage and the
      satisfaction both partners derive. This will be tested using a short telephone survey.

        Couples who have children with ASD will be recruited to participate in this study from the
        Weinberg Child Development Center in the Edmond and LilySafra Children'shospital,
        ShebaMedical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel. Parents will be contacted through the telephone and
        provided with a brief explanation about the study. Participation will be voluntary with no
        monetary compensation. Parents who volunteer to participate will then be presented with a
        short telephone survey, asking them about their marital status and other variables related
        to the link between parenting an ASD child and their marital status.
