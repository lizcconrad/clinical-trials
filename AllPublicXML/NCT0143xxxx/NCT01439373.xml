    <textblock>
      GSK2336805 is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor being developed for the treatment of
      chronic hepatitis C (CHC). This study will assess the safety, antiviral activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 alone and in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and
      ribavirin in subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection is a major public health problem globally and a leading cause of chronic liver
      disease. New medications are needed that are better tolerated and offer a greater chance of
      achieving sustained viral clearance compared to currently available therapy. GSK2336805 is a
      HCV NS5A inhibitor being developed for the treatment of subjects with CHC. This Phase II,
      double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety, antiviral
      activity, and pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 alone and in combination with peginterferon alfa
      2a and ribavirin in subjects with CHC. Subjects will be randomly allocated on a 2:1 basis to
      GSK2336805 or matching placebo and will be stratified by IL28B status and HCV viral genotype
      (genotype 1 or 4). The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, GSK2336805 or matching placebo
      will be given as single-dose monotherapy (Day 1). In Part 2, GSK2336805 or matching placebo
      will be co-administered with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin through 4 weeks of treatment
      (Days 2 to 28). After completion of Part 2, GSK2336805/matching placebo will be discontinued
      and subjects will be offered continued standard-of-care anti-HCV therapy.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HCV Viral Load During 24 Hour (h) Following a Single Dose of GSK2336805 on the Log 10 Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline [Pre-dose], 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and 24 h)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for determination of HCV RNA levels were collected at immediately prior to and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and 24 h after the first dose in Part 1 (Day 1). Measurement of HCV viral load was analyzed by the central laboratory using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV test. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment on or before the first dose of study drug. Change from Baseline was computed as value at post Baseline specified time point minus Baseline value. Virus RNA levels reported as &lt;43 are undetectable levels. If the result for HCV RNA (IU/ML) was &lt;43, then change from Baseline was calculated using 42, and the change from Baseline on the log scale was calculated using log (42).</description>

        <description>RVR was defined as the proportion of participants below the assay lower limit of detection (LOD) &lt;18 International units per milliliter (IU/mL) for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) after 4 weeks of treatment (Day 28). Participants achieving RVR at Day 28 were considered treatment responders. Participants with missing HCV RNA values at Day 28 or discontinued before Day 28 were considered as treatment failure . Proportion of participants with HCV genotype 1 achieving RVR was the primary comparison of interest to show superiority of GSK2336805 over placebo in genotype 1 participants.</description>

        <description>RVR was defined as the proportion of participants LOD &lt;18 IU/mL for HCV RNA after 4 weeks of treatment (Day 28). Participants achieving RVR at Day 28 were considered treatment responders. Participants with missing HCV RNA values at Day 28 or discontinued before Day 28 were considered as treatment failure. Proportion of participants with HCV genotype 1 achieving RVR was the primary comparison of interest to show superiority of GSK2336805 over placebo in genotype 1 participants. The primary and supportive analysis differs from the nominal analysis as supportive analysis is assessed at Day 28 ± 2 (2 days visit window) whereas, the nominal analysis was assessed at Day 28.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HCV Viral Load During 24 Hour (h) Following a Single Dose of GSK2336805 on the Log 10 Scale</title>
        <description>Blood samples for determination of HCV RNA levels were collected at immediately prior to and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and 24 h after the first dose in Part 1 (Day 1). Measurement of HCV viral load was analyzed by the central laboratory using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV test. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment on or before the first dose of study drug. Change from Baseline was computed as value at post Baseline specified time point minus Baseline value. Virus RNA levels reported as &lt;43 are undetectable levels. If the result for HCV RNA (IU/ML) was &lt;43, then change from Baseline was calculated using 42, and the change from Baseline on the log scale was calculated using log (42).</description>

        <description>Single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained. The standard ECG criteria of potential clinical importance were 1) absolute QTc Interval, &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec), 2) absolute PR Interval, &lt;110 msec, 3) absolute QRS Interval, &lt; 75 msec and 4) increase from baseline in QTc &gt; 60 msec. QTc Interval was calculated using Frederica correction formula: QTcF = QT / (RR)^1/3. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline assessment value from post Baseline visit value. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment on or before the first dose of study drug. The change from Baseline in QTc Interval at Day 2 and 28 were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline to Worst Post Baseline Toxicity Grade Hematology Parameters for Day 1 to Day 28</title>
        <description>Laboratory abnormalities were graded according to the modified division of AIDS ( DAIDS）version 1.0. Shift from Baseline to worst post baseline toxicity grade (where applicable) were presented for Day 1 to Day 28. The toxicity Grades were, Grade 1: mild (no or minimal interference with usual social &amp; functional activities); Grade 2: moderate (greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities); Grade 3: severe (inability to perform usual social and functional activities); Grade 4: potentially life threatening (inability to perform basic self-care functions or Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death). Hematology parameters were red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet white blood cell count with differential leukocyte count, mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Alanine Aminotransferase Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose), Day 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 for determination of serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment on or before the first dose of study drug. Change from Baseline was computed as value at post Baseline specified time point minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC[0-24]), AUC From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of GSK2336805, at Day 1</title>
        <description>AUC values were determined using the linear-up, log-down trapezoidal rule. The individual plasma concentration and actual time data was used to derive the PK parameters of GSK2336805 on Day 1 by noncompartmental PK analyses. For the calculation of PK parameters all plasma concentrations that were below quantification limit (BLQ) before the first measurable concentration were set to zero. The BLQ values that occur at the end of the profile after the last quantifiable concentration were set to missing. Actual sampling times, rather than scheduled sampling times, were used in all computations of PK parameters.</description>
