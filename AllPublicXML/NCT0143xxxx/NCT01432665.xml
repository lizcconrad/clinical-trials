    <textblock>
      The Lybrido study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with a 4-week
      baseline establishment period, 16 week treatment period and a follow up period for a total of
      26 weeks on study. Subjects are randomly to one of seven treatment arms. The study
      investigates the effective dose of Lybrido in increasing the number of satisfactory sexual
      episodes in the domestic setting in 210 healthy female subjects with hypoactive sexual desire
      disorder and low sensitivity for sexual cues (30 subjects per group).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of satisfactory sexual encounters based on event questionnaires on active drug as compared to placebo during double-blind treatment period episodes in the domestic setting.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy is estimated by self reporting by subjects using daily event questionnaires, recorded within 24 hours after a sexual event. The number of events between a 4-week baseline establishment period will be compared with the number of events during the 8 week double-blind treatment period. In addition there is a 8 week run in period between the establishment period and the double blind treatment period for a total treatment period of 20 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual satisfaction will be evaluated based on a global satisfaction assessment comparing the 4-week establishment period with the 8 week DB treatment period. In addition there is a 8 week run in period between the establishment period and the double blind treatment period for a total treatment period of 20 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual desire and arousal</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual desire and arousal will be evaluated based on the 'desire' and 'arousal' domains of the Sexual Anamnesis Questionnaire, the Sexual Function questionnaire and weekly diaries throughout the course of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual motivation and inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual motivation and inhibition will be assessed using the Sexual Motivation Questionnaire and comparing sexual motivation and inhibition between the 4-week establishment period and the 8-week DB treatment period. In addition there is a 8 week run in period between the establishment period and the double blind treatment period for a total treatment period of 20 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and toleration</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by: 1) AEs [Number of patients reporting AEs, number of patients reporting drug related AEs] 2)SAE [Number of patients reporting SAEs, number of patients reporting drug related SAEs]and 3) Changes in laboratory safety data [Number of patients reporting abnormal lab safety data, number of patients reporting drug related abnormal lab safety data]. These will be evaluated throughout the course of the study.</description>
