  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed as a phase Ib open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study
      evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue in promoting the
      healing of the deep partial-thickness component of complex skin defects. The proposed study
      population will include patients with 3-49% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) complex skin
      defects including a deep partial-thickness component resulting from thermal injury. The study
      has been designed to focus on the evaluation of safety and tolerability of prolonged exposure
      to increasing amounts of a single application of StrataGraft skin tissue, while also
      assessing the potential for StrataGraft tissue to promote healing of the deep
      partial-thickness component of these complex skin defects as an alternative to donor site
      harvesting and autografting. Targeted enrollment for this study is up to 30 patients with
      complex skin defects due to thermal burns which require surgical excision and autografting.
      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled in two cohorts of increasing treatment area receiving
      StrataGraft skin tissue that has been stored refrigerated prior to clinical use. A third
      cohort will receive StrataGraft skin tissue which has been stored cryopreserved and thawed in
      the operating room just prior to grafting.
