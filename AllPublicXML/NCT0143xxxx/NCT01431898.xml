  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>through 24 weeks of off-treatment follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate safety and tolerability of escalating multiple oral doses of GS 9669.
Safety will be assessed during the study through the reporting of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs at various time points during the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Antiviral Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>through 24 weeks of off-treatment follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate antiviral activity of GS-9669 against HCV in genotype-1a and 1b (GT1a/b) subjects. This will be evaluated using change from baseline in plasma HCV RNA. Reduction in HCV RNA will be summarized as categorical (as &lt; 1, ≥ 1 to &lt;2, ≥ 2 to &lt;3, or ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL) reduction from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Viral Dynamics and Pharmacodynamics</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 17 days of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the viral dynamics of GS-9669. The median change from baseline in HCV RNA and time-weighted average change from baseline through Day 3 will be assessed based on plasma HCV RNA sampling times to characterize the viral dynamics of GS-9669.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>composite of Pharmacokinetics</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 17 days of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the plasma PK parameters of GS-9669. The secondary PK endpoints will be evaluated using standard non-compartmental methods. Relevant PK parameters will be determined using standard non-compartmental methods with the linear-logarithmic trapezoidal rule utilizing a PK data analysis program (e.g., WinNonlin®) for GS-9669 as appropriate: Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau, λz, AUC0-last, AUCtau, , CL/F, and T½.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotypic Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>through 24 weeks of off-treatment follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize genotypic changes from baseline in the NS5B coding region of HCV following multiple dose administration of GS-9669 and for up to 24 weeks thereafter</description>

    <description>Multiple-dose, dose-escalation study of GS-9669, a nonnucleotide NS5B inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV), in subjects with chronic HCV infection. Dosing is planned in up to 7 unique dosing cohorts. Each cohort will be comprised of 10 genotype 1a (Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) or genotype 1b (Cohort 6 and 7), with eight subjects randomized to receive active drug and two subjects randomized to receive placebo per cohort.</description>
