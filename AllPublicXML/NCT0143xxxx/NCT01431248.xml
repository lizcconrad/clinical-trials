  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) is treated with an antibiotic, erythromycin or
      azithromycin, to prolong pregnancy. Erythromycin is taken for several days and can result in
      stomach upset in some patients, causing them to stop taking the medication. Therefore,
      azithromycin is often prescribed instead. Azithromycin is usually taken only once and stomach
      upset is not seen or greatly reduced. The goal of this study is to see if there is a
      difference between the antibiotic (azithromycin) compared to the antibiotic (erythromycin) in
      prolonging pregnancy in patients with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM). The
      working hypothesis is that there is no difference in the clinical effectiveness between
      antibiotic regimens containing te macrolides azithromycin and erythromycin for prolonging
      latency in PPROM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard regimen for PPROM patients between the gestational age of 24 0/7 and 32
      0/7 weeks, is to administer ampicillin 2gm IV every 6hours for 48hrs followed by amoxicillin
      250mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days, with erythromycin 250mg IV for 48hours followed by
      500mg orally every 8hours for 5 days. Our study design would be a prospective randomized
      trial. Consented, eligible women will be randomized to receive ampicillin as above plus
      either azithromycin 1 gm orally at enrollment or erythromycin 250mg IV every 6 hours for
      48hours followed by 500mg orally every 8hours for 5 days. Those who are unable to tolerate
      the 1gm of azithromycin within the first 30 minutes of administration, a 1000mg powder
      suspension will be given. In conjunction with standard protocol, a course of steroids for
      fetal lung maturity will be administered upon the treating staff's discretion, and all Group
      B Beta Streptococcus positive patients will be treated.
