  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study the investigators found that many bakery workers were sensitized to
      storage mites, and many had rhinitis symptoms. The role of storage mites as an occupational
      allergen with clinical relevance has been questioned, and the investigators wanted to
      investigate whether a nasal provocation with a storage mite extract would trigger symptoms
      and objective signs of rhinitis in bakery workers and a control group.

      The investigations include allergy testing with skin prick testing, and measuring of specific
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in sera, answering a questionnaire, and symptom scoring before and
      after provocations. The participants will be investigated one day with a placebo, and another
      day with the allergen extract of either Acarus Siro or Lepidoglyphus Destructor. As a
      measurement of nasal patency we use the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter, but also clinical
      scoring of nasal secretion and blockage. Indices of inflammation (ECP and alfa-Macroglobulin)
      will be monitored in nasal lavage.
