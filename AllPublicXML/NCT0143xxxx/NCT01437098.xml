    <description>The SF-36 assessment was used to evaluate subject Quality of life (QoL) by assessing change in physical function and general health status. The SF-36 v2TM Scoring Program2,3 was used to convert raw scores ranging from 0 to 100 into norm-based scores, allowing direct comparison to the reference values for the Japanese population. A norm-based score of less than 50 was interpreted as below average when compared to the Japanese population whereas norm-based scores greater than 50 were interpreted as above average.</description>

             followings:

               -  Angle at aortic root (the angle between aortic valve annulus plane and horizontal
                  plane/vertebra) exceeds 70°.

               -  Vessel diameter of femoral or iliac artery is less than 6 mm.

               -  Aorta has severe calcification, excess tortuosity or severe atherosclerosis.

          <description>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk model predicts the risk of operative mortality and morbidity after adult cardiac surgery on the basis of patient demographic and clinical variables. After information has been entered on a given case, the online STS risk calculator provides a risk percentage for each of the outcomes. The risk percentage estimates the chance of a specific outcome for a patient with the indicated risk factors. A higher score indicates a higher risk. A lower score indicates a lower risk.</description>

Class II Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class IV Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

Class II Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 assessment was used to evaluate subject Quality of life (QoL) by assessing change in physical function and general health status. The SF-36 v2TM Scoring Program2,3 was used to convert raw scores ranging from 0 to 100 into norm-based scores, allowing direct comparison to the reference values for the Japanese population. A norm-based score of less than 50 was interpreted as below average when compared to the Japanese population whereas norm-based scores greater than 50 were interpreted as above average.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 assessment was used to evaluate subject Quality of life (QoL) by assessing change in physical function and general health status. The SF-36 v2TM Scoring Program2,3 was used to convert raw scores ranging from 0 to 100 into norm-based scores, allowing direct comparison to the reference values for the Japanese population. A norm-based score of less than 50 was interpreted as below average when compared to the Japanese population whereas norm-based scores greater than 50 were interpreted as above average.</description>
