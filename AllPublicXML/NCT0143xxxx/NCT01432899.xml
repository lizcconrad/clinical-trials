      Background:

      - Childhood-onset dystonia is caused by a brain injury. It causes muscle contractions and
      twisting movements that the person with dystonia cannot control. The term hemidystonia is
      used when only one side of the body is affected. When dystonia starts during childhood, the
      brain and nerves may not develop normally. People with hemidystonia can become disabled
      because of the unwanted postures and twisting that dystonia causes. More research is needed
      to determine how dystonia affects brain development.

      Objectives:

      - To study brain function in people with hemidystonia.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 40 years of age who developed hemidystonia before age 13.
           Only one wrist may be affected by hemidystonia, and participants must have at least some
           movement in that wrist.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study requires five visits to the NIH Clinical Center: a screening visit and four
           study visits. Each visit will last up to 3 hours. Visits will be scheduled about once a
           week. The study procedures may be done in any order.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will have the following tests:

        -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. During the scan, participants will be asked to
           move their hand at the wrist when they hear a tone.

        -  Motor tests of arm movement, balance, and walking. These tests may also examine nerve
           development and muscle tone.

        -  Two transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions to study the electrical activity of the
           muscles and brain. These sessions may also involve sensory tests. Participants will have
           hearing tests before the first session and after the second session.

        -  No treatment for hemidystonia will be provided as part of this study.

      Objective

      In childhood-onset hemidystonia, motor and sensory abnormalities pose a great challenge to
      voluntary movement. In an effort to inform future methods of treatment of this disorder, this
      study seeks to (1) characterize involuntary muscle activity, (2) explore neurophysiologic
      mechanisms of involuntary muscle activity, (3) characterize abnormalities of sensation, (4)
      assess performance on two sensorimotor tasks (voluntary postural control, and a
      reach-to-grasp arm movement), and (5) explore brain abnormalities using imaging in
      childhood-onset hemidystonia.

      Study Population

      The dystonia group will consist of 40 individuals (age 7-40 years) with childhood-onset
      hemidystonia. The control group will consist of 40 individuals within the same age range with
      no neurological disorders.

      Design

      This is a cross-sectional study, in which multiple assessments will be performed over a short
      period. Results in the dystonia group will be compared to results in the control group. Due
      to the laterality of brain injury in hemidystonia, outcomes from both arms and cortical
      hemispheres will be compared to each other. Outcomes within the dystonia group will be
      correlated with validated dystonia rating scales as well as with the age at the time of
      injury.

      Outcome Measures

      In Objective 1, we will analyze the timing of involuntary electromyographic (EMG) activity
      and kinematics triggered in the dystonic arm during various tasks. In Objective 2, we will
      investigate various types of intracortical inhibition (short intracortical inhibition, long
      intracortical inhibition, contralateral silent period, and ipsilateral silent period) and
      intracortical facilitation in motor cortical regions controlling the dystonic wrist flexor
      during voluntary contraction of the wrist extensor using transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS). In addition, we will perform a coherence analysis between EMG activity in the wrist
      flexor and extensor muscles and between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the primary
      motor cortex and the contralateral wrist muscles. In Objective 3, we will test tactile sense
      (spatial and temporal), vibration sense, and stereognosis of the hand. In Objective 4, we
      will analyze seated limits of stability (voluntary postural control), and the timing and
      amplitude of EMG activity and kinematics in the arm during a reaching and grasping arm
      movement. In Objective 5, we will obtain brain scans with structural magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional connectivity MRI, and
      functional MRI during a simple task.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age 7 40 years, inclusive

          -  Good general health, with enough energy to carry out the assessments

          -  Ability to understand and comply with instructions. Adults must be able to provide
             their own consent.

          -  Passive motion of at least 15 degrees extension and 15 degrees flexion from neutral of
             both wrist joints

          -  Agreement to not drink caffeine or alcohol for 24 hours before each study session
             because both agents can modify brain activity and may confound outcome measures.

        Additional inclusion criteria for individuals with dystonia:

        - Childhood-onset (before 13 years of age) hemidystonia in one wrist. Diagnosis of dystonia
        will be made based on the Hypertonia Assessment Tool (HAT)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy Volunteers:

        -Presence of any neurological disorders

        Individuals with Dystonia:

          -  Botulinum toxin injection in the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis in
             the last 6 months

          -  Concurrent use of medicines for muscle tone (e.g., baclofen, trihexyphenedyl,
             dantrolene sodium, tizanidine, or carbidopa/levodopa). If patients are taking these
             medications daily, the treating physician will be contacted by the MAI to determine if
             it is acceptable for the subject to temporarily discontinue the medication(s). If the
             risk of weaning, or stopping the medication is deemed harmless, the MAI and/or
             treating physician will determine a schedule to wean, or stop the medication. The goal
             is for the subject to be off medication(s) for 24 hours prior to participating in
             testing for this study. For these subjects, there will be at least 4 days between
             scheduled research visits to avoid a prolonged time off medication(s).

        Additional exclusion criteria for TMS:

          -  Seizure in the last 2 years

          -  Concurrent use of anti-seizure medication

          -  Hearing loss

          -  Cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable
             cardiac disease, with intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators,
             cochlear implants, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head,
             excluding the mouth that cannot be safely removed.

             cardiac disease, with intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators,
             cochlear implants, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head,
             excluding the mouth that cannot be safely removed.

          -  Pregnancy: For any female of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be done.
             Childbearing potential will be determined during the history and physical.
