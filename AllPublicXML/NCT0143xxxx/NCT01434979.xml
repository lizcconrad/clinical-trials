  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to monitor and quantify the differential physiologic and biomarker
      responses of controls to standardized exercise under thermoneutral and thermally challenged
      conditions and responses of exertional heat stroke (EHS) subjects under a thermal-challenged
      environment to develop unique bio-signature panels to predict those at risk for exertional
      heat illness (EHI) and guide return to duty following an episode of EHS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heat tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour heat test</time_frame>
    <description>Heat tolerance is determined by physiologic response to a 2-hour heat tolerance test. During this test, participants with core temperature greater than 38.5 C and/or heart rate greater than 150 bpm are considered heat intolerant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Genetic response to heat tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour heat heat tolerance test</time_frame>
    <description>DNA microarray will be conducted to see whether certain genes can predict response to the heat. Likewise, RNA microarray of RNA expression pre- and post-heat test will be conducted to further determine genetic pathways of heat intolerance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour heat tolerance test</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat and aerobic capacity will be measured to quantify their contribution to heat tolerance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral correlates of heat tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>past month</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires will be used to assess behavioral correlates of heat tolerance, including measures of sleep impairment and executive dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived heat strain</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour heat tolerance test and 2-hour control test</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of perceived heat strain will be recorded to determine how accurately participants perceive that they are working in the heat, and whether this adds diagnostic value to the heat test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure in response to heat tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>2-hour heat tolerance test and 2-hour control test</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be recorded to see whether it blood pressure response to exercise in the heat correlates with heat tolerance.</description>
