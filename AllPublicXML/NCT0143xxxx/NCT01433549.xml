  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of lens-free (recovery) intervals of
      varying lengths on end-of-day comfort and tear film changes with daily contact lens wear.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in a cross-over design with two phases. Each phase consisted of four
      cycles approximately 12 hours in length. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for
      2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80
      minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear. A
      12-hour lens-free wear period preceded each phase.

    <measure>Mean End-of-Day Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 12</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by the participant using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (extremely uncomfortable) to 100 (very comfortable and fresh) at the end of each 12-hour (approximate) cycle. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for 2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80 minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Non-Invasive Tear Film Break-Up Time (NITBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 12</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by the investigator using a corneal topographer. NITBUT was assessed at the end of each 12-hour (approximate) cycle. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for 2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80 minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear. A longer tear film break-up time indicates a more stable tear film and may lead to a more comfortable lens-wearing experience.</description>

        <title>Mean Non-Invasive Tear Film Break-Up Time (NITBUT)</title>
        <description>As assessed by the investigator using a corneal topographer. NITBUT was assessed at the end of each 12-hour (approximate) cycle. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for 2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80 minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear. A longer tear film break-up time indicates a more stable tear film and may lead to a more comfortable lens-wearing experience.</description>
