    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies continuous intraventricular methotrexate in treating
      patients with leptomeningeal disease. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving drugs directly into the ventricles may be an effective
      treatment for patients with leptomeningeal disease

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of continuous intraventricular methotrexate
      infusion in the treatment of leptomeningeal disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the dose limiting toxicities. II. Describe the pharmacodynamics of continuously
      delivered intraventricular methotrexate.

      III. Assess for response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intraventricular methotrexate continuously on days 1-14. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (from solid tumors)

          -  Subjects with lymphomatous or leukemic meningitis

          -  The effects of methotrexate on the developing fetus are unknown; for this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for six months following the conclusion of study participation; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she will be
             excluded from the study and should inform her treating physical immediately

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status greater than 70%

          -  All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent

          -  We will exclude subjects who have had prior intrathecal/intraventricular therapy with
             methotrexate within 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with methotrexate for management of leptomeningeal disease

          -  Subjects with evidence of hydrocephalous

          -  Subjects with intraparenchymal lesions or bulky disease

          -  Subjects with ventriculoperitoneal shunt in place

          -  Previous history of whole brain radiation therapy

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may not be able to comply
             with the safety monitoring requirements of the study will not be included in this
             trial
