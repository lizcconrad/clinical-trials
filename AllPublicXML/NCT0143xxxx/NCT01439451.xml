  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a prospective experimental Randomized Control Trial study design.
      Independent old adults (age 70 years old and older) who do not suffer from balance problems
      willing to participate in the study will be tested before and after Peturbation balance
      training during walking to explore whether there are differences in balance control and
      balance reactions as a result of training.

    <textblock>
      A total of 48 old adults will be enrolled, evaluated and trained. They will be randomly
      assigned to two groups: one exercise group (perturbation training) and one group without
      perturbation. No gender based differences are expected for the recovery outcome measures so
      we will be able to pool male and female individuals for this analysis. Each subject of the
      experimental and of the control groups will be trained on 24 occasions over a period of 10-12
      weeks (20-30 minutes, 2-3 times/week). This regimen was based on previous balance training
      study that demonstrated improvements in balance control with similar training duration and
      frequency. Gait and balance function and physical activity level will be tested in both
      groups before, immediately after, 3 and 6 months after completion of the training period to
      explore the benefit and carryover of training. In addition using monthly phone calls, falls,
      their severity, functional activity limitations in the home and community setting and health
      status will be monitored 12 months after the training period.
