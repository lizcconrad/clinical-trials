  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by low platelet counts and the
      risk of severe bleeding complications. The two recently introduced TPO-RA drugs, namely,
      eltrombopag and romiplostim, have shown efficacious sustained response with continuous
      administration. Both drugs are indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopia in patients with
      chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or
      splenectomy. While these trials address important clinical questions they were not intended
      to evaluate what happens in the real-world settings with actual patient living daily lives.
      The purpose of this health outcomes study is to understand how the two TPO receptor agonists
      (TPO-RA) currently available in the US are being used in clinical practice and how their use
      impacts chronic ITP patients' daily lives. The study hypothesis is that patients who switched
      to eltrombopag report a better health-related quality of life than those who switched to
      romiplostim. This study utilized a hybrid design of retrospective chart review study and
      cross-sectional patient survey. A customized Patient Case Report Form (CRF) will be used to
      retrospectively collect clinical data from patient medical charts where the primary cohorts
      consist of patients who have switched from other ITP medication to eltrombopag or
      romiplostim. A cross-sectional survey will be employed to collect patient reported outcomes
      (PRO) data, including health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, using a
      compository questionnaire. Analyses of cross-sectional survey data and retrospective medical
      chart review data in patients who switch to either eltrombopag or romiplostim from their
      prior primary therapy will be conducted.

    <measure>treatment satisfaction scores by domain</measure>
    <time_frame>During a 5 month period, the questionnaire will be administered to each participant at one time point. The recall period for the TQSM in this study is 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction will be captured with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). The questionnaire is composed of 14 items. Mean scores will be reported for each treatment group by domain. The domains of the TSQM are effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction</description>

    <measure>Short-form 36 (SF-36) score</measure>
    <time_frame>During a 5 month period, the questionnaire will be administered to each participant at one time point. The recall period for the SF-36 in this study is 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a general overall health instrument consisting of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Scales include general health, limitations of activities, physical functioning, emotional health, social activities, pain, and energy/ emotional functioning. Scores for social functioning and physicial functioning will also be reported</description>
