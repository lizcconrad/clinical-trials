    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SSR411298 200 mg daily
      compared to placebo as adjunctive treatment for persistent cancer pain based on Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS).

      Secondary Objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of SSR411298 200 mg daily on pain, breakthrough pain frequency,
           background therapy utilization, mood, patient satisfaction of pain relief, nausea,
           constipation, healthcare utilization and quality of life;

        -  To evaluate the tolerability and safety of SSR411298 as adjunctive treatment for
           persistent cancer pain;

        -  To characterize patient disease, in terms of cancer, cancer treatment, cancer pain and
           cancer pain treatment;

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of SSR411298 as adjunctive treatment for
           persistent cancer pain;

        -  To assess endocannabinoid plasma concentrations.

    <time_frame>5 weeks (from D-7 (seven days before randomization) up to D28)</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is an 11-category descriptive anchor scale that is one of the most frequently employed and accepted scales for pain evaluation. Score ranges from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst possible pain].
Average NRS score is defined as the average of pain intensity scores measured daily by NRS during a week.</description>

    <description>The HADS is a self-reported scale that contains 14 items rated on 4-point Likert scales. Two subscales assess depression (7 items) and anxiety (7 items). Each 7-item subscale yields a score of 0 to 21 that is interpreted with the following cut points: 0-7, normal; 8-10, mild mood disturbance; 11-14, moderate mood disturbance; and 12-21, severe mood disturbance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constipation as measured by the Bowel Function Index (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks (from D-7 (seven days before randomization) up to D28)</time_frame>
    <description>The BFI is a 3-item questionnaire to measure constipation from the patient's perspective. The time frame for the questions is &quot;during the last 7 days&quot;. The answer for each of the 3 items is rated on a scale from 0 (easy or no difficulty) to 100 (severe difficulty).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks (from D-7 (seven days before randomization) up to D28)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction of pain relief is a 5-point Likert scale that measures patient satisfaction with treatment. The five categorical responses are: extremely unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, extremely satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks (from D-7 (seven days before randomization) up to D28)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire contains a total of 30 items, of which 28 items are rated on 4-point Likert-type scale and 2 items are rated on 7-point Likert scale. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items.
A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>
