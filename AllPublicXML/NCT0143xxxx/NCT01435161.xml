  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different lowing blood pressure strategies have a different clinical efficacies. Blocking the
      angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Telmisartan) reduces the incidence of episodes of atrial
      fibrillation in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 24 months
      than 30% compared to Nifedipine( Adalat GITS ).

      A total of 160 subjects will be included in two study groups. The Group 1 will receive
      80-160mg Telmisartan per day, the remaining patients will receive Nifedipine ( Adalat GITS).
      Follow-up is 24 months. The conventional 12-lead ECG recordings at twice weeks interval and
      24hrs holter monitor will determine the cardiac rhythm and asymptomatic episodes of atrial
      fibrillation. The target of Blood pressure after 3 months is less than 130/80mmHg.
      Concomitant therapy with B-blocker and acethydrazide are allowed for the target blood
      pressure during the study.
