  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sealants have been shown to be the most effective caries preventive measure in permanent
      dentition. Sealants of the primary molars soon after they erupt would reduce the total caries
      experience of the primary teeth of the children and could possibly also postpone the caries
      process in the permanent dentition.

      The aim of this study is to measure the caries preventive effect of sealants in primary
      molars. The specific objectives are: 1) to compare the number of new caries experience teeth
      and surfaces among the intervention group of 4-years old pre-school children during the 1
      year follow-up period, 2) to compare the preventive effect of sealants with fluoride varnish
      on the caries experience on the occlusal surfaces of the primary molars and on the total
      caries experience of all the primary and permanent teeth, 3) to test the feasibility of the
      sealant program in one kindergarten in Kuwait city.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of healthy occlusal tooth surfaces of primary molars</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured by a clinical examination (dental caries status/ICDAS) one year after the fissure sealants and fluoride varnish have been applied. When a child has intact occlusal surfaces on primary molars in the baseline examination, s/he will get a fissure sealant on the other side of the mouth and fluoride varnish on the other side.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of healthy occlusal tooth surfaces after application of fissure sealants versus fluoride varnish</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured by a clinical examination (dental caries status/ICDAS)one year after the fissure sealants and fluoride varnish have been applied. The effectiveness of these two preventive treatment will be compared, i.e. how many occlusal surfaces of primary molars stayed caries free with the sealant application vs. fluoride varnish application.</description>
