      Each subject will participate in four separate study periods. In each period, subjects will
      be admitted to the clinical unit approximately seven hours on the day prior to being given
      study drug. Subjects will remain at the clinical research unit for the next 24 hours after
      they have received study drug. Subjects will return to the clinical research unit at 36 and
      48 hours after they have received study drug to give blood samples. There will be a minimum
      of a four day &quot;washout&quot; period, between each study period.

      Under certain circumstances, subjects may be asked to return to the clinical research unit
      for an additional study period.
