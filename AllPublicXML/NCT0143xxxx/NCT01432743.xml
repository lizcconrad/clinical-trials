    <textblock>
      Comparison of Two Strategies for Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation - a comparison of
      ablation guided by Cartomerge and NavX Fusion. 3D mapping systems are widely used in catheter
      ablation of AF. Integration of a previously acquired image of the left atrium into the
      electroanatomical (EA) map offers several potential advantages, including visualisation of
      the complex anatomy of the left atrium, reduction of fluoroscopy time and improved results .
      The two most widely used systems are Cartomerge (Biosense Webster, etc) and NavX Fusion (SJM,
      etc). Although both systems have been independently validated, their clinical utility has not
      previously been directly compared in a randomised trial

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomised to either NavX Fusion or Cartomerge. They undergo a standard catheter
      ablation procedure and data is collected. Both systems are routinely used in our clinical
      practise. This is a comparison trial of 2 mapping technologies.
