  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular occlusion is used to reduce blood loss during liver resection (LR), but may cause
      ischemic damage to the remnant liver and can lead to liver failure in case of chronic liver
      disease. This restriction of blood flow (ischemia) and subsequent restoration (reperfusion)
      causes a harm that is called ischemia- reperfusion injury. Injuries sustained during the
      ischemic phase are related to a lack of oxygen to reduce cellular respiratory events can lead
      to, in a few minutes, irreversible damage. Ischemic preconditioning as a technique to protect
      the liver parenchyma during liver resection consists of an initial flow clamping for 10
      minutes, with subsequent reperfusion for 10-15min, followed by a complete portal triad
      clamping during transection.

      Detailed Description:

      This is a prospective controlled trial, conducted between July 2011 and July 2012. This study
      has been initiated by Liver &amp; Transplant Division, Hospital Dr Cosme Argerich, Buenos Aires
      Argentina. The protocol was approved by ethics committees and an informed consent was
      obtained from each patient before they were enrolled. Sixty patients were randomized to
      either receive ischemic preconditioning prior to liver resection under intermittent pedicle
      clamping or Intermittent Pringle ischemia. Ischemic preconditioning was performed through a
      sequence of 10 minutes vascular inflow occlusion and 10 minutes of reperfusion prior to
      continuous pedicle clamping during resection. Intermittent pedicle clamping was conducted
      through a sequence of 15 minutes of vascular inflow occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion.
      The randomization process which was centralized was held in the operating room after
      inclusion criteria had been check and exclusion criteria ruled out.
