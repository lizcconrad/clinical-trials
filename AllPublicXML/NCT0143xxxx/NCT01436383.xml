  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial investigates changes in metabolism during high altitude expedition up to 6865m. A
      mass-spectrometry based platform is used to detect different oxidative stress related
      metabolites. Symptoms of acute mountain sickness are evaluated and correlated with laboratory
      parameters.

      Background

      Altitude related illness, which include acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude
      pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), is common in subjects exposed
      to high altitude during professional or leisure time activities. There are independent risk
      factors such as: individual susceptibility and rate of ascent. HAPE is a potentially
      life-threatening complication of high altitude stay, mostly occuring within the first 2-5
      days of exposure. Although there is a controversial discussion, excessive hypoxic pulmonary
      vasoconstriction is thought to be the main trigger for developing HAPE. Beside the
      controversial discussion if hypobaric hypoxia leads to oxidative stress it is not known
      whether oxidative stress contributes to AMS or HAPE.

      Objective

      The investigators hypothesize that reactive oxygen species are generated during high altitude
      stay and contribute to the development of acute mountain sickness. Furthermore they would
      like to describe other changes in metabolic pathways possibly contributing to vessel tone
      dysregulation.

      Methods

      36 healthy volunteers will examined during an high altitude medical research expedition to
      Mount Muztagh ata (7549m) in Western China. Acute mountain sickness scores and clinical
      parameters will be assessed. Metabolomics analysis of more than 390 parameters, using a mass
      spectrometry-based targeted metabolomic platform, is used to detect systemic oxidative stress
      and functional impairment of enzymes that require oxidation-sensitive co-factors. Furthermore
      routine laboratory test will be done, for example CRP, creatinine and interleukines
