      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
           SAR245408 administered in combination with SAR256212 in adult patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the global safety profile of SAR245408 in combination with SAR256212

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR245408 and SAR256212 used in
           combination

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and tumor volume change (for expansion
           cohort only)

        -  To determine the immunogenicity of SAR256212 as administered with SAR245408

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a 28 day screening period followed by 28 day cycles (21 day cycle for the every
      three week dosing regimen, if used) . Patients will continue to receive SAR245408/SAR256212
      as long as there is clinical benefit or until a study withdrawal criterion is met. The last
      posttreatment visit will be 60 days after the last dose or until IMP-related toxicities have
      resolved or are deemed irreversible, whichever is later.
