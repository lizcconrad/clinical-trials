      The purpose of this study is to identify in prediabetic subjects, physiopathological changes
      involved in the evolution to type 2 diabetes mellitus and to identify new biomarkers of type
      2 diabetes risk in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a real public health issue, with an exponential incidence. Before
      its diagnosis, several physiopathological changes are already taking place, such as insulin
      resistance of target tissues and the progressive inability of pancreatic beta cells to
      produce insulin. The objective of this study is a better understanding of the prediabetic
      stage and mechanisms involved in the possible development of T2D, by way of a five-year
      follow-up cohort study in 207 prediabetic subjects.

    <description>The study period per patient is 5 years. The planned schedule of the study is as follows :
Enrollment at visit V0 of subjects at high metabolic risk, based on a biological value (within the past 2 months) of moderate fasting hyperglycaemia (blood glucose ≥ 1,10 g/l and &lt; 1,26 g/l) or fasting blood glucose ≥ 1 g/l and &lt; 1,10 g/l with HbA1c ≥ 6,5%.
First biological sample (B0) within 1 month following V0 (measuring fasting blood glucose + glycated hemoglobin HbA1c + lipid profile + creatinemia + liver function; and establishment of a biological sample collection to identify biomarkers).
Annual follow-up for five years consisting in one blood sample (B1 to B5) measuring the same parameters as V0 + biological sample collection, and questionnaire on major health events or health events related to study procedures.
