    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of ropinirole PR
      after single and multiple doses of the PR-formulation. It will also investigate the safety
      and tolerability of ropinirole PR after single and multiple doses of PR-formulation.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult men and women between 18 and 45 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Body weight &gt;=50Kg.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) 19 - 24 kg/m2.

          4. No abnormality on clinical examination.

          5. No abnormality revealed by the clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the
             pre-study medical examination.

          6. A normal 12-lead ECG at the pre-study screening.

          7. Normal systolic (100-140mmHg) and diastolic (&lt;90mmHg) blood pressure at pre-study
             screening.

          8. Written informed consent prior to admission to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history and physical
             or laboratory examination significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric,
             haematological or renal abnormalities.

          2. Definite or suspected personal history or family history of adverse reactions or
             hypersensitivity to the study drug or to drugs with a similar chemical structure.

          3. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs.

          4. The subject has received prescribed medication within 7 days prior to the first dosing
             day, which in the opinion of the principal medical investigator interfered with the
             study procedures or compromised safety.

          5. The subject has received over-the-counter (OTC) medicine within 48 hours prior to the
             first study day. Subjects who took OTC medication could still be entered into the
             study, if, in the opinion of the principal/co-investigator, the medication received
             did not interfere with the study procedures or compromised safety of the subjects.

          6. Abuse of alcohol, defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an
             average daily intake of greater than three units. One unit is equivalent to half a
             pint of beer, one measure of spirits or one glass of wine.

          7. Positive screen for addictive drugs and tobacco.

          8. Participation in a trial with any drug within the 1 month before the start of the
             study.

          9. Either blood donation within the previous 3 months, or donation of a quantity of blood
             within the previous 12 months that would result in the subject having donated more
             than 1,500mL blood in a period from 12 months before this study up to and including
             the end of the study.

         10. Positive pre-study screening result for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody and
             HIV-1/2 antibodies.

         11. Pregnancy and/or lactation;

         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are intending to become pregnant and/or
             are not willing to avoid pregnancy by means of barrier contraception methods (i.e.
             condoms or IUD) during the study from 5 days prior to screening or in the 3 months
             following the study.

         13. Female subjects with positive serum hCG test result at screening or on Days 1 of both
             study phases with positive urine HCG test.
