    <textblock>
      Alefacept, also known as Amevive®, is a medication approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) in the United States and other countries for the treatment of psoriasis,
      which is a chronic inflammatory immunological skin condition that can result in chronic dry,
      red patches that are covered in scales. Alefacept is approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      psoriasis but not as an anti-rejection medication in transplant patients. It is now being
      tested in new kidney transplant patients as a supplement to other approved anti-rejection
      drugs. Alefacept will be used as an investigational drug in this study.

      The reason for this study is to test whether using Alefacept will inhibit T cells, known as
      memory cells, using a test named ELISPOT-IFN. In patients with psoriasis, Alefacept inhibits
      these memory cells. If memory cells specific to your donor can be inhibited by this drug, it
      might prevent rejection and promote acceptance of the transplanted kidney in a unique manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to sign informed consent

          -  Adult (&gt;18years) kidney-alone transplant recipient

          -  6 months post-transplant

          -  Persistently positive donor-stimulated ELISPOT-IFN (≥30 spots/300K cells)-2 positive
             assays separated by at least one week

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment and must agree to maintain effective
             birth control during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline CD4 count &lt;250 cells/uL

          -  Acute rejection episode within the 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  Clinically overt infection within the 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  History of BK polyoma viremia

          -  Recipient or donor is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Subject has a current malignancy or a history of malignancy (within the past 5 years),
             except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             treated successfully

          -  Any major illnesses/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially
             increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of the
             study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's response
