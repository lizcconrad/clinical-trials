      The specific aims of this study are:

        -  To determine the prevalence of bullying in children who present to the ED with
           behavioral symptoms

        -  To assess mental health diagnoses and their relationship to type, severity and frequency
           of bullying behaviors, as well as demographic and psychosocial correlates (socioeconomic
           status, stress and support) and their relationship to type, severity and frequency of
           bullying (bullies versus victims).

        -  To explore the attitudes, values, triggering events and potential solutions using
           qualitative methods

        -  To gain greater insight into the patient experience and perceptions of the bullying
           events

        -  Data Collection sheet

             1. Demographic information (Date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity)

             2. Assessment of socioeconomic status (Type of Insurance, Zip Code, Parent education
                level, Parent type of work)

             3. Child physical attributes (Appearance, Weight, Height, Percentiles &amp; BMI, Assisted
                Devices, Disabilities)

             4. Academic performance (Whether grades are age appropriate, previous grade results

             5. Extra-curricular activities (Questions include do you participate in sports? Are
                you member of any sport team? Are you member of any club?)

      Qualitative Measurement

      In order to understand bullying and victimization, a brief qualitative interview will be
      conducted by the principal investigator and his team. These questions may provide insights
      into the dynamics of bullying.

      Quantitative Measurement

      Following measurement scales will be used in the assessment of children with bullying
      Bullying → Olweus Bullying Questionnaire Child behavior → Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist
      Stress, life events and adversities → Adolescent Perceived Events Scale (APES) Social support
      → Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (Malecki 2000) Social status → MacArthur Scale of
      Subjective Social Status Family Structure → A documentation of family structure and dynamics
      Mental health status → Psychiatric evaluation
