  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence reduces treatment benefit and can bias the assessment of treatment efficacy
      thereby involving safety risks for the patient and influencing health cost-effectiveness.
      This observational study will concentrate upon the role of MS nurses in influencing
      adherence. This study will examine the influence of initial and subsequent periodic nurse
      interviews which aim to improve adherence to BetaferonÂ® treatment.
