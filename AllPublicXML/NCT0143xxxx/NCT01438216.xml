      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin in intensive
      care patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Not a lot is known about the pharmacokinetic profile of anidulafungin in IC-patients.
      IC-patients are at high(er) risk for getting a systemic mould/yeast infection. Anidulafungin
      is a safe echinocandin with, so far, no reported interactions and few adverse effects. Due to
      this, anidulafungin is used more often on IC-wards. It is part of the national (Netherlands)
      IC sepsis protocol. The factors that influence the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin in
      IC-patients has not been studied yet. Because these factors are unknown for this population,
      it is necessary for this research to be done.

      Any patient with an (suspected) invasive candidiasis whom is treated with anidulafunging can
      be includen.

      20 patients will be included from 2 different university hospital (10 each). Samples will be
      taken on different days and timepoints, troughlevels on all treatment days and on treatment
      day 3 and 7 more samples will be taken voor AUC calculations.
