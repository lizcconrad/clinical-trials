      The purpose of this study is to provide emergency treatment of adult and pediatric patients:

        -  Following a fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose regardless of the presence of symptoms
           or

        -  Who exhibit early-onset, severe or life-threatening toxicity affecting the cardiac or
           central nervous systems, and/or early-onset, unusually severe adverse reactions (e.g.,
           gastrointestinal toxicity and/or neutropenia) within 96 hours following the end of
           fluorouracil or capecitabine administration.

      Demographics, baseline disease information, prior disease-directed therapy including
      fluorouracil or capecitabine, and details of the fluorouracil or capecitabine overexposure
      (dose, cause, and timing) will be collected. Adverse events information will be collected and
      recorded. Patients will be followed for 30 days unless the patient expires or resumes
      chemotherapy within the 30 day period.
