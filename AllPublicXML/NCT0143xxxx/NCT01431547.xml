    <textblock>
      This is a study of dalotuzumab given as monotherapy and in combination with ridaforolimus for
      pediatric participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will have three parts. Part 1
      will find a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and collect pharmacokinetic (PK) data for
      dalotuzumab alone. Part 2 will find an MTD and collect PK data for dalotuzumab in combination
      with ridaforolimus. Part 3 will be an expansion cohort at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD)
      found in Part 2 to confirm the RPTD and look at the potential efficacy of the combination
      therapy.
