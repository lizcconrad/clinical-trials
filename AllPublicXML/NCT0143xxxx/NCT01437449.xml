    <textblock>
      Docetaxel and cetuximab are FDA approved for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck. Cisplatin and carboplatin, while not FDA approved for Squamous Cell Carcinoma
      of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), have been used as standard of care in patients with SCCHN in
      combination with other drugs. This study will determine if weekly cisplatin and docetaxel, in
      combination with cetuximab, will be effective in palliative treatment of patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. These drugs will be given intravenously weekly,
      repeated 3 of every 4 weeks until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse
      events.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck sites, including all pharynx, larynx, oral
             cavity, skin and para-nasal sinus sites. Patients with SCC of unknown primary
             presenting in the neck clinically compatible with head and neck mucosal primary sites
             are eligible.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemoradiation, radiation, and/ or surgery in the
             potentially curative setting are eligible as long as 3 months has elapsed since the
             end of the potentially curative treatment ended.

          -  Patients must be greater than 16 years old.

          -  ECOG Performance Status &lt; 3 at enrollment is required.

          -  Laboratory value requirements at enrollment:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3

               -  Platelet count &gt;100K/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN unless liver metastases documented. In this latter case,
                  AST and ALT &lt; 5 x ULN required.

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has Gilbert's syndrome, in which
                  case T. Bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN required

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR an estimated creatinine clearance from 24 hour
                  urine collection &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  Clinical requirements at enrollment:

               -  Peripheral neuropathy &lt; grade 2

               -  Hearing loss in best ear &lt; grade 2 per Chang criteria if audiogram performed. *24
                  Formal audiology is not required in patients with no clinical evidence of hearing
                  loss at baseline.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior palliative chemotherapy

          -  Patients with active infections including HIV are not eligible. HIV positive patients
             on HAART with undetectable blood HIV levels are eligible. Patients with a history or
             serological evidence of exposure to Hepatitis B without active infection are eligible
             for this study.

          -  Patients with prior grade 3 allergic or infusion reactions to docetaxel, cisplatin or
             cetuximab are not eligible. A history of well tolerated infusion reactions is NOT an
             exclusion.

          -  Pregnant women and/or nursing patients will be excluded from the study because of
             potential harm to the fetus or nursing infant.

          -  Because the primary endpoint of this study is response rate and not survival, patients
             with a history of other malignancies treated curatively greater than one year prior to
             enrollment and without evidence of relapse at the time of enrollment are eligible.

          -  Patients with brain metastasis are eligible only if by CNS imaging there is no
             evidence of CNS progression at least 30 days following definitive CNS treatment
             (resection or radiation).
