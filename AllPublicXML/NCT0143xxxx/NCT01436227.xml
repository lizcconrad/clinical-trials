  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pazopanib can help to control Von
      Hippel-Lindau Syndrome VHL. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      kidney cancer. Its use to treat VHL is investigational.

      Pazopanib is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients needed for
      tumor growth. This may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.

      Pazopanib will be provided at no cost to you during this study.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take pazopanib by mouth
      1 time every day, at about the same time each day, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a
      meal.

      If you have any side effects from the drug, tell the study doctor right away. The study
      doctor may then lower the dose or keep the dose level the same.

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks.

      Study Visits:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

      Every 2 weeks (for the first 8 weeks) and then once every cycle, blood (about 3 teaspoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 12 weeks (+/-7 days):

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving and any side
           effects that you have had.

      At the end of Cycles 3 and 6 and then every 12 weeks:

        -  You will have CT scans and MRI scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an eye exam.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive treatment on this study for up to 24 weeks (6 cycles). If your doctor thinks
      you are benefitting, you may continue on study. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit
      and follow-up.

      Early Withdrawal/End-of-Study Visit:

      If you leave the study for any reason, the following tests will be performed.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving and any side
           effects that you have had.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have CT scans and MRI scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctors thinks it is needed, you will have an eye exam.

      Long-Term Follow-up:

      After you are off-study, the study staff will collect information about how you are doing
      either by checking your medical record or by calling you. If you are called, it will be about
      30 days after the last dose and then about every 3 months for up to 24 weeks. Each call
      should only last about 5 minutes.
