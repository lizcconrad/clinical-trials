      The main objective of this study is to compare the proportions of late enhancement in
      patients with Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction as Herceptin ® and in a control group
      consisting of patients who did not have LV dysfunction after 6 months under the same
      treatment.

    <description>A cardiac MRI is considered positive if demonstrated a late hyperintense from 15 to 20 minutes after injection of gadolinium chelate, whatever its size, topography subepicardial (intramyocardial) and without vascular systematization.
The primary endpoint is the proportion of delayed enhancement in the LV dysfunction group and the control group.</description>

    <description>The examinations will be conducted on an MRI with a dedicated antenna heart, by a physician with expertise in cardiac MRI.
After establishing a good quality ECG synchronization, the following sequences are carried out successively:
Sequences locating anatomical
T2 black blood (such as ESF)
rapid sequence of cine-MRI (such as balanced FFE) vertical and horizontal long axis and short axis of the base to the apex
T1-weighted sequence with inversion recovery for the assessment of possible consequences of cell damage.</description>
