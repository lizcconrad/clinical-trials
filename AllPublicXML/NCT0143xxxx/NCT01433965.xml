  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lenalidomide can stop the growth of
      leukemia stem cells and can be used to prevent the return of leukemia cells after a
      transplant.

      The purpose of this study is determine whether lenalidomide can directly inhibit leukemic
      stem cells in vivo and can be used to prevent the relapse of leukemia stem cells after
      transplant. A concern with any post transplant intervention is the possibility of multiple
      drug interactions, potential for graft versus host disease exacerbation and/or induction of
      cytopenia. Therefore, the smallest doses of lenalidomide (5 mg) that has been used in this
      setting will be utilized as dose level 1. Starting six months post-transplant, patients will
      begin on a daily dose of lenalidomide. Dependent on the cohort, patients will receive 5 to 20
      mg of lenalidomide post transplant. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by
      the incidence of grade III-IV toxicities of all organs and grade II-IV GVHD. Duration of
      treatment is six months.
