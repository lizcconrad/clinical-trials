    <textblock>
      Development of a bio-behavioral stochastic model-predictive controller (SMPC) for use as an
      artificial pancreas in T1DM requires fundamental behavioral and physiology studies, as well
      as translational modeling and engineering development. In order to be successful, closed-loop
      control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) must adapt to individual physiologic
      characteristics and to the behavioral profile of each person. An essential part of this
      adaptation is biosystem (patient) observation. The investigators propose to lay the
      foundation for a closed-loop control system which will include algorithmic observers of
      patients' behavior and metabolic state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intensive descriptive study will follow 60 adults with T1DM who are currently
      experienced with insulin pump use for a two-week training period plus a one month active
      study period during which the DexCom SEVEN® PLUS Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) will be
      used in tandem with the OmniPod® Insulin Management System. The OmniPod® has a built in
      FreeStyle glucometer that allows tagging of food and activity-related treatment behaviors
      with each self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) value. The OmniPod® personal digital assistant
      (PDA) also stores information about insulin delivery and meal size in relation to the
      carbohydrate content. Parallel recording of CGM and behavioral data, as well as psychometric
      instruments will produce a rich synchronized data set for each person that will ultimately
      lead to the development of a behavioral event generator for use in future open-loop and
      closed-loop control algorithms for intelligent insulin dosing.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria or
             judgment of a physician) for at least two years prior to the enrollment in the study.

          -  Use of an insulin pump to treat their diabetes for at least six months.

          -  Actively using a bolus calculator function with the current insulin pump with
             pre-defined parameters for glucose goal, carbohydrate ratio, and insulin sensitivity
             factor.

          -  Age 21 - 65 years. The investigators will not be studying children since the DexCom
             Seven® Plus is not approved for use in children. Adults over age 65 are likely to have
             medical exclusions for the follow-up Phase 2 study, which involves induced
             hypoglycemia.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study for 6 weeks wearing a DexCom Seven® Plus CGM
             and OmniPod® insulin pump, performing self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) with the
             integral FreeStyle glucometer 4 times per day (before meals and bedtime) in addition
             to SMBG required to calibrate the CGM or to validate a low or high BG alarm (&lt;70 mg/dl
             or &gt;300 mg/dl), and recording behavioral events by tagging SMGB values throughout the
             study with meal and activity descriptors.

          -  Willingness to avoid consumption of acetaminophen-containing products for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Demonstration of proper mental status and cognition for completion of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Psychiatric disorders that would interfere with study tasks (e.g. mental retardation,
             substance abuse)

          -  History of a systemic deep tissue infection with methicillin-resistant staph aureus or
             Candida albicans

          -  Known bleeding diathesis or dyscrasia

          -  Active enrollment in another clinical trial

          -  Medical requirement for acetaminophen-containing products during the study period for
             more than 1 week

          -  Medical condition that would make operating a CGM or insulin pump difficult (e.g.
             blindness, severe arthritis, extensive scar tissue at sites where devices are
             inserted).

          -  Need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) during
             the study.

          <description>Behavioral: This is a field study that will investigate behavioral events (e.g. meals, exercise) in T1DM and daily glucose patterns using an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, and frequent SMBG tagged with behavioral markers (recent food and activity). From these data, a learning algorithm – behavioral observer - will be able to track over time key recurrent elements, such as wake-up time, meals, exercise, and daily patterns of risks for hypo- or hyperglycemia. In future controllers, behavioral observation such as this will be used to forecast upcoming routine events, enabling open-loop and closed-loop control algorithms to deal with the probabilistic patterns of patients’ self-treatment behavior.</description>

            <title>Behavioral Observer</title>
            <description>Behavioral: This is a field study that will investigate behavioral events (e.g. meals, exercise) in T1DM and daily glucose patterns using an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, and frequent SMBG tagged with behavioral markers (recent food and activity). From these data, a learning algorithm – behavioral observer - will be able to track over time key recurrent elements, such as wake-up time, meals, exercise, and daily patterns of risks for hypo- or hyperglycemia. In future controllers, behavioral observation such as this will be used to forecast upcoming routine events, enabling open-loop and closed-loop control algorithms to deal with the probabilistic patterns of patients’ self-treatment behavior.</description>
