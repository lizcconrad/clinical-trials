  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if questions in English about symptoms that patients may
      have during cancer treatment are understandable when translated into Spanish. These questions
      will later be used in future studies to give a better understanding of patient symptoms&quot;.

    <description>The investigators will conduct up to two rounds of PRO-CTCAE (patient-reported outcome- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version questionnaire administration followed by cognitive interviews in Spanish-speaking Latino patients who are receiving cancer treatment or who have completed treatment for cancer within the past six months at one of the participating sites.</description>

    <intervention_name>questionnaire administration followed by cognitive interviews</intervention_name>
    <description>Each cognitive interviewing procedure will include two parts. Participants will first be asked to independently complete a series of PRO-CTCAE symptom items in a Patient Questionnaire. Following completion by the participant of the Patient Questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE items, the bilingual interviewer will query participants regarding item comprehension, relevance, inclusiveness, cultural appropriateness, and cognitive processes used to generate responses, via a semi-scripted cognitive debriefing interview developed to assure consistency across interviews.</description>
