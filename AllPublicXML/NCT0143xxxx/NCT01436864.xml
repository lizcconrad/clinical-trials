      This study is designed to prove and confirm the efficacy and safety of multiple injections of
      human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-Fc fusion protein (KH902) in
      patients with choroidal neovascularization due to neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration by comparing intravitreal injections of KH902 with sham-injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the United
      States and other western countries. A quantity of documents indicate that neovascularization
      promoted by VEGF is the main cause of visual acuity decline. Patients are starving for a new
      drug which can notably improve VA with less administration frequency and lower treatment
      cost.

      The new drug Recombinant Human VEGF Receptor-Fc Fusion Protein (KH902) is a gene fusion
      protein. The pre-clinical researches and phase II study showed that KH902 is
      well-tolerated,and safe, it is effective in inhibiting the growth, migration, pullulation of
      vascular endothelial cells and neovascularization induced by VEGF.

      This study is designed to prove and confirm the efficacy and safety of multiple injections of
      KH902 in patients with choroidal neovascularization due to neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration by comparing intravitreal injections of KH902 with sham-injections.
