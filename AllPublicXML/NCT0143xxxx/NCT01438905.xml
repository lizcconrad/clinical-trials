  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a gentle pressure movement performed
      at the ankle by a physical therapist on muscle function and ankle motion in individuals who
      frequently twist (sprain) their ankle.

    <textblock>
      Novel rehabilitation methods, that specifically target decreased muscle activation due to
      joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle
      function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary evidence
      suggests ankle joint mobilization can improve contributions of spinal influences on ankle
      muscle activation in individuals with ankle joint pathology, but there is a considerable gap
      in understanding cortical contributions to muscle activation following joint injury. It is
      unknown how joint mobilization concurrently affects cortical and spinal neural motor
      pathways, as well as clinical measures of patient function. The overall aim of this grant is
      to determine the immediate effects of talocrural joint mobilization on cortical and spinal
      muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus muscles in individuals with
      chronic ankle instability (CAI). The secondary aims of this study will examine changes in
      ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. This innovate approach will
      provide the necessary scientific knowledge regarding the potential mechanism and efficacy of
      joint mobilization.

    <measure>Changes in Muscle activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after each manual therapy intervention; 1 week study</time_frame>
    <description>To determine cortical and spinal changes in muscle activation of the fibularis longus and soleus following one of three intervention protocols. Changes in cortical and spinal muscle activation will be measured by examining resting motor threshold via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and the H-reflex technique, respectively.
The investigators hypothesize that the higher intensity talocrural joint mobilization will result in a greater increase in cortical and spinal activation of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles than the lower intensity talocrural joint mobilization.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Ankle dorsiflexion ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after each manual therapy intervention; 1 week study</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the changes in ankle dorsiflexion ROM following one of two talocrural joint mobilization techniques (higher or lower intensity) or control intervention in individuals with CAI. Changes in ankle dorsiflexion ROM will be quantified using a weight bearing lunge.
The investigators hypothesize that the higher intensity (Grade V) talocrural joint mobilization will result in a greater improvement in ankle dorsiflexion ROM than the lower intensity (Grade IV) talocrural joint mobilization and the control intervention will result in no change in ROM.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Dynamic Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after each manual therapy intervention; 1 week study</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the acute changes in balance following one of two talocrural joint mobilization techniques or control intervention in individuals with CAI. Changes in balance will be quantified using the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral components of the Star Excursion Balance Test.
The investigators hypothesize that the higher intensity talocrural joint mobilization will result in greater improvements in reach distance in all three SEBT directions compared to the lower intensity talocrural joint mobilization.</description>
