  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate brachytherapy is an effective treatment option for men with localized prostate
      cancer, with excellent cure rates and a favorable toxicity profile. With the current needle
      insertion technique, seed placement inaccuracy is primarily caused by needle deflection and
      soft tissue deformation, which both occur during the brachytherapy operation. This study will
      accrue 20 patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy implants and acquire a series of
      ultrasound images, video clips and one CT scan.
