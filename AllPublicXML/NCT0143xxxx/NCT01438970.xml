  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, prospective, uncontrolled study to include 12 consecutive patients
      with cirrhosis of the liver and recurrent or refractory ascites. The main aim (primary
      objective) of the study is to investigate the effect of treatment of ascites by the Sequana
      medical pump on the renal and circulatory function in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent
      or refractory ascites. The secondary objectives are the following:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of treatment for handling ascites, associated with changes in
           the body weight of patients and their requirements for evacuation paracentesis during
           follow-up.

        -  To investigate the effects of treatment on bacterial translocation, by means of
           determining bacterial DNA.

        -  To determine the incidence of complications associated with treatment in the course of
           follow-up.

        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment on quality of life of the patients treated,
           evaluated in questionnaires entitled Short Form-36 and CLDQ (chronic liver disease
           questionnaire).
