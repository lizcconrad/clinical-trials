  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a designed viral vector that can destroy cancer cells while leaving normal cells
      largely unharmed. The virus also stimulates an immunological response by producing a special
      factor (GM-CSF) to attract and promote the development of dendritic and T effector cells. It
      forms the hypothesis that this regimen may be used for people who have failed current forms
      of treatment and are recommended for cystectomy. It is with hope that this novel therapy will
      be able to delay or potentially avoid cystectomy for this patient population. Bladder
      instillation of this agent causes little long lasting side effects and may drastically
      improve the stimulation of the immune system for local cancer cell death as well as
      destroying those tumor cells that may have travelled to regional lymph nodes or distant
      organs.

    <textblock>
      After the phase I/II CG0070 trial review, it became apparent that the use of CG0070 oncolytic
      vaccine as an intravesical agent for oncolytic lysis of tumor cells, together with the
      transcription of GM-CSF on site, may have distinct advantages. This first study showed
      excellent tumor response rates of 48-77% depending on the dose schedule administered. All of
      these patients had residual non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who have previously failed BCG
      therapy at the time of treatment.

      With the addition of a transduction agent such as DDM, the intravesical instillation of
      CG0070 enabled uniform distribution of viral particles and exposure to the tumor during those
      30-60 minutes instillations as contrast to the intra-tumor injection, intra-arterial or
      intravenous injection of viral particles in other oncolytic viral trials. Some or most of
      these delivering methodologies have obvious intrinsic imperfections and potential toxicity.
      This unique opportunity of an relatively easy intravesical tumor exposure is difficult to
      duplicate in other solid tumor models.

      The replication of CG0070 in the majority of patients during the first phase I/II trial
      indicated tumor lysis with release of tumor specific or tumor associated antigens that have
      been stably expressed, in abundant quantities during tumor cell death. Release of tumor
      antigens have been the key elements, together with sufficient on-site GM-CSF, in stimulating
      strong cross-presentation and confirmation signals to the antigen presenting cells such as
      dendritic cells interacting with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This concept of a &quot;real time&quot; vaccine
      like regimen is expected to compare favorably with other forms of cancer immunotherapy
      treatment such as BCG in this patient population.

      It is with this thought that CG0070 may find a success in this setting because of a
      reasonably and proven complete response rate in residual and failed BCG bladder cancer
      patients in the first phase I/II study (some cases with only one instillation). Of importance
      as well, is the demonstration in the study data of a strong GM-CSF expression during its
      replication phase. Those patients with carcinoma in situ disease and those with RB pathway
      dysfunction were particularly responsive.

      It is therefore, desirable to formulate a protocol to encompass the specialty of this
      oncolytic vaccine and the unique intravesical delivery to prove the efficacy by a randomized
      controlled study. This opportunity allows a study on the CG0070's beneficial effects, if any,
      on the standard of care for carcinoma in situ non muscle invasive bladder cancer patients
      after they failed BCG therapy. The prognosis of this group presently depends mainly on early
      radical cystectomy, which carries a high morbidity and decrease of quality of life generally
      viewed as unacceptable for this group of older patients.

             successfully treated with BCG, but subsequently found to have recurrence. The standard
             course of intravesical therapy must include six weekly treatments (allowable range of
             instillations per course is 4-9). The second course of BCG can consist of three weekly
             treatments

             procedures.

         10. Histopathologically confirmed, transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma. Urothelial
             tumors with mixed histology (but with &lt;50% variant) are eligible.

         11. No evidence of urethral or renal pelvis TCC by upper tract radiological imaging (e.g.,
             intravenous pyelogram, CT urogram, or retrograde pyelogram) within the past 2 years.

         12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;2.

             TURBT

          3. History of anaphylactic reaction following exposure to humanized or human therapeutic
             monoclonal antibodies, hypersensitivity to GM-CSF or yeast derived products,
             clinically meaningful allergic reactions or any known hypersensitivity or prior
             reaction to any of the formulation excipients in the study drugs.

          6. Any underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study vaccine hazardous to the patient, would obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events, or surgical resection. Anticipated use of

             systemic steroid (exception: inhaled or topically applied steroids, and acute and
             chronic standard dose NSAIDs, are permitted). Use of a short course (i.e., ≤ 1 day) of
             a glucocorticoid is acceptable to prevent a reaction to the IV contrast used for CT
             scans.

          9. Immunosuppressive therapy, including: cyclosporine, antithymocyte globulin, or
             tacrolimus within 3 months of study entry.

             clinically meaningful allergic reactions or any known hypersensitivity or prior
             reaction to any of the formulation excipients in the study drugs.

         13. History of stage III or greater cancer, excluding urothelial cancer. Basal or squamous
             cell skin cancers must have been adequately treated and the subject must be
             disease-free at the time of registration. Subjects with a history of stage I or II
             cancer, must have been adequately treated and have been disease-free for ≥ 3 years at
             the time of registration.

             autoimmune thyroid disease, uveitis)

         15. Progressive viral or bacterial infection

         16. All infections must be resolved and the patient must remain afebrile for seven days
             without antibiotics prior to being placed on study

         17. Any underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study vaccine hazardous to the patient, would obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events, or not permit adequate surgical resection.

         18. Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or cooperate fully with the
             investigator and site personnel
