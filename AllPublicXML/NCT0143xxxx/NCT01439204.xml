    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Abatacept-induced Immunogenicity Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 29, 57, 71</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity determination was based on titers of anti-abatacept and anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4-T) antibodies in serum over time. A participant had a positive abatacept-induced immunogenicity if 1 of the following criteria were met: missing baseline measurement and a positive response after baseline; negative baseline response and positive response after baseline; a baseline response and a positive response after baseline that has a titer value strictly greater than the baseline titer value. A validated, sensitive, electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) method was used to analyze the antibodies in serum. Samples confirmed positive with ECL and with abatacept serum concentrations of less than equal to 1 µg/mL were further analyzed with a validated, in vitro, cell-based bioassay to analyze the sera containing the abatacept neutralizing activity. Samples obtained on Days 29, 57 and 71 post dose of abatacept on Day 1 (baseline).</description>

        <description>AUC (0 - T) was derived from serum concentration versus time data. Serum samples were analyzed for abatacept by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were obtained at: predose (0 hours), 0.25 hours (h), 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 72, 168, 336, 504, 672, 1008, 1344, and 1688 h post dose (Days 1 to 71). The results were summarized. The lower limit of assay quantitation (LLOQ) was 1.00 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). AUC (0 - T) was measured in micro grams*hour per milliliter (µg*h/mL).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Positive Abatacept-induced Immunogenicity Response</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity determination was based on titers of anti-abatacept and anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4-T) antibodies in serum over time. A participant had a positive abatacept-induced immunogenicity if 1 of the following criteria were met: missing baseline measurement and a positive response after baseline; negative baseline response and positive response after baseline; a baseline response and a positive response after baseline that has a titer value strictly greater than the baseline titer value. A validated, sensitive, electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) method was used to analyze the antibodies in serum. Samples confirmed positive with ECL and with abatacept serum concentrations of less than equal to 1 µg/mL were further analyzed with a validated, in vitro, cell-based bioassay to analyze the sera containing the abatacept neutralizing activity. Samples obtained on Days 29, 57 and 71 post dose of abatacept on Day 1 (baseline).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Positive Abatacept-induced Immunogenicity Response</title>
          <description>Immunogenicity determination was based on titers of anti-abatacept and anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4-T) antibodies in serum over time. A participant had a positive abatacept-induced immunogenicity if 1 of the following criteria were met: missing baseline measurement and a positive response after baseline; negative baseline response and positive response after baseline; a baseline response and a positive response after baseline that has a titer value strictly greater than the baseline titer value. A validated, sensitive, electrochemiluminescence assay (ECL) method was used to analyze the antibodies in serum. Samples confirmed positive with ECL and with abatacept serum concentrations of less than equal to 1 µg/mL were further analyzed with a validated, in vitro, cell-based bioassay to analyze the sera containing the abatacept neutralizing activity. Samples obtained on Days 29, 57 and 71 post dose of abatacept on Day 1 (baseline).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure - Safety Population</title>
        <description>Blood pressure was obtained while the participant had been quietly seated for at least 5 minutes. Baseline was the 0 hour measurement on Day 1 (day of dosing) or if this value was missing, the last measurement before dosing. Blood pressure was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Days 1, 2, 15, 29, 57, and 71.</description>

        <population>All participants who received study drug (safety population) and had systolic assessment were included in the analysis. Days 1 and 2 N=36 both arms; Day 15 (Lonza arm N=36; Devens arm N=34; Day 29 (N=33 in both arms); Day 57 (Lonza arm N=31; Devens arm N=33); Day 71 (Lonza arm N=36; Devens arm N=34).</population>
