  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety
      and tolerability of RG1662 in individuals with Down Syndrome. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in cohorts to receive either multiple oral doses of RG1662 or placebo. Anticipated
      time on study treatment is 38 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult individuals, 18 to 30 years of age, with diagnosis of Down Syndrome (confirmed

          -  Males and non-pregnant non-lactating females

          -  Parent or legal guardian/representative and caregiver willing to give written informed
             consent

          -  Subject willing and assenting or consenting to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major depressive disorder not adequately controlled by a selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor

          -  Subjects meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for autistic spectrum disorder,
             attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder unlikely to cooperate and take part
             successfully in the study assessments

             undergone congenital heart surgery can be enrolled provided they have no residual
             complication requiring intervention (e.g. pace maker)

          -  Subjects with clinically significant obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma that is
             not adequately treated (oral steroids are not allowed)

          -  Subjects with thyroid dysfunction that is not adequately controlled and stabilized on
             treatment for at least 8 weeks

          -  Subjects with sustained elevated supine blood pressure (SBP/DBP) at rest exceeding
             140/90 mmHg or notable resting tachycardia (mean HR &gt; 60 bpm) or blood pressure below
             90/40 mmHg

          -  Subjects who have taken any other investigational medications within 3 months

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m2
