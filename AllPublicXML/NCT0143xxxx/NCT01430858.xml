  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that vibration exercise can induce
      higher than normal bone strains and strain rates than are experienced during habitual
      locomotor activities.

      The investigators plan to study healthy young volunteers to:

        1. Determine the relationship between tibial bone strain and

             -  the frequency and amplitude of vibration therapy

             -  a range of habitual locomotor activities;

        2. Determine the transmission of vibrations during vibration therapy, in terms of

             -  amplitude attenuation and phase shift of positional coordinates and accelerations
                at anatomic landmarks along the lower leg and other skeletal sites

             -  the relationship between these and different frequencies and amplitudes of
                vibration therapy;

        3. Determine the muscle power in the lower limb associated with various habitual locomotor
           activities and its relationship to the measured tibial bone strain.

      The investigators subsequently hope to use the data captured in this experiment to develop a
      QCT-based finite element (FE) model of the human lower limb (tibia, fibula and foot). The
      investigators will then validate this model in relation to the characteristics (amplitude and
      phase shift) of the measured tibial bone strain and transmission of vibrations to the
      different anatomical landmarks during vibration therapy.

    <description>We wish to determine the relationship between tibial bone strain (recorded from implanted tibial strain gauges) and measured displacements of the limb and pelvis (using video motion analysis) during vibration exercise and a range of habitual locomotor activities. Only healthy volunteers will be recruited to this one arm.</description>

    <description>The study participants will each undergo sterile surgical implantation of a tibial bone strain gauge in the right leg (dominance will recorded and determined by handedness). A single stacked, 45°, rosette strain gauge (FRA-2-11 Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Japan) will be unilaterally bonded to the medial tibial cortex and carefully aligned with the long axis of the tibia. The gauge will be attached at the mid-shaft region, to determine the transmission of the vibrations through the bone and quantification of the microstructural effect.</description>

Juvent 1000 platform The volunteers will stand on the platform for one minute during which a 20-second duration of videomotion &amp; strain gauge readings will be captured.
Power Plate Pro5 Two amplitude settings will be tested, described as low &amp; high. The subject will stand on each platform test for up to 1 minute, during which a 20-second duration of videomotion &amp; strain gauge readings will be captured.</description>
