  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial cuff inflation before insertion is generally used for laryngeal mask airway insertion
      in children. However, it is not proven how much the cuff should be inflated. The aim of this
      study is to compare efficacy between the method using the resting volume and the method using
      half the maximum volume for partial cuff inflation.

    <measure>The intra-cuff pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5 to 10 minutes after insertion of LMA.</time_frame>
    <description>1) After insertion of LMA, we confirm adequate ventilation. And then we measure intra-cuff pressure using cuff pressure manometer. 2) After confirming adequate ventilation, tidal volumes are measured using spirometer sensor attached anesthesia machine. Five corresponding inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes are recorded and the difference between these is calculated as the leak volume. The time that measures the intra-cuff pressure and leak volume is approximately 5 to 10 minutes after insertion of LMA.</description>

    <description>80 patients are randomly allocated into two groups : resting volume group (n=40), half the maximum volume group (n=40). In the resting volume group, the pilot balloon valve is connected to syringe without piston for keeping the valve open to the atmosphere and allowing the pressure within the cuff of LMA to equalize with atmospheric pressure. In the half the maximum volume group, the cuff of LMA is completely emptied and then the cuff is filled with the half the maximum volume.</description>
