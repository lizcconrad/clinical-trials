  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the application of Besivance™ (besifloxacin ophthalmic
      suspension, 0.6%) to treat congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children. The
      hypothesis of the study is that Besivance™ is as safe and effective as the current standard
      of care for the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Besivance™ as
      an antibiotic treatment for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction with infection in
      children. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline on the physician rated
      scale of Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction (NLDO)with infection to follow-up visit #2 (Week 8) or
      at the time of treatment failure, if earlier.

    <measure>Change in Physician-rated Scale of NLDO From Baseline to Follow-Up Visit at Week 8 or From Baseline to Time of Treatment Failure, if Earlier.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The NLDO grading scale in the study eye at every visit. The scale ranges from 0 to +4:
0: No tearing and discharge.
1: Tearing, moderate mucous discharge around nasolacrimal punctum
2: Moderate redness of the medial eyelid with mucous discharge
3: Redness and swelling of the eyelid with mucopurulent discharge
4: Redness and swelling of eyelid with purulent discharge
Due to varying baseline severity (measured by NLDO grade) among subjects, change from baseline to week 8 in NLDO grade was further classified as the following:
Treatment success: grade of 0 or improvement by 2 or more compared to the prior visit.
Recurrence: NLDO with infection returns in the study eye, as indicated by a NLDO grade &gt;0 after a grade of 0 at the prior visit.
Treatment Failure: grade is worse than or same as the baseline visit.</description>

    <measure>Number of Recurrences by Randomization Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16 (Closeout Visit )</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence is defined as when the NLDO with infection in the subject's study eye returns, as indicated by a NLDO grading scale of greater than zero after achieving a grade of zero at the previous visit.
Number of subjects who had a recurrence event of the subjects who completed the study by treatment Group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Recurrence Treatment as Measured by Change in the Physician- Rated Scale of NLDO</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16 (Closeout Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who experience recurrence were re-treated as if they were a new patient, with the same study medication, were followed up then classified as &quot;Treatment Success&quot; or &quot;Treatment Failure&quot; according to study protocol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the time of failure or Week 16 (Closeout Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Possible treatment failure at a follow-up examination is operationally defined as follows: if the physician-grading scale of NLDO is worse than or same as the prior visit at any given follow-up visit, possible treatment failure then exists.
Treatment Failure occurred if at visit #1 (2-week visit), the physician-grading scale of NLDO is worse than or same as the baseline visit. Treatment failure can also occur at recurrence visit #1 if the NLDO grading scale is worse or the same as compared to the previous visit. Subjects who meet the criteria for treatment failure were withdrawn from the study by the principal investigator and no additional data was collected. Subjects were referred for continued care.</description>

    <description>During each study visit, the Principal Investigator will evaluate any possible adverse events by assessing clinical complaints and symptoms that are experienced by subjects and observed by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), including findings in external, lacrimal duct system and anterior segment using slit lamp and fundus exam using indirect ophthalmoscope by principal investigator, as well as clinical signs including findings in external, nasolacrimal duct system and anterior segment using slit lamp and fundus exam using indirect ophthalmoscope by principal investigator.</description>

2: Moderate redness of the medial eyelid with mucous discharge
3: Redness and swelling of the eyelid with mucopurulent discharge
4: Redness and swelling of eyelid with purulent discharge
Due to varying baseline severity (measured by NLDO grade) among subjects, change from baseline to week 8 in NLDO grade was further classified as the following:
Treatment success: grade of 0 or improvement by 2 or more compared to the prior visit.
Recurrence: NLDO with infection returns in the study eye, as indicated by a NLDO grade &gt;0 after a grade of 0 at the prior visit.
Treatment Failure: grade is worse than or same as the baseline visit.</description>
