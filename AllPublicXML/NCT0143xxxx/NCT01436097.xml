      Interventions to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables to date have shown
      promise, but many have limited public health impact due to the lack of scalability of their
      designs. The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of an
      intervention for promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables by incentivizing
      their purchase. Collaborating with UpLift Solutions, the investigators will enroll shoppers
      in this Randomized Clinical Trial using the research infrastructure called the Way to Health
      platform. (called the Way to Health platform, and approved as a Prime protocol by the IRB as
      reference # 811860).

      Hypothesis: providing patients with financial incentives can promote healthier behaviors
      (e.g.: eating healthier).

      This is a pilot study under the IRB-approved umbrella protocol number 811698 named Penn-CMU
      Roybal Center on Behavioral Economics and Health. Interventions to increase the consumption
      of fruits and vegetables to date have shown promise, but many have limited public health
      impact due to the lack of scalability of their designs. Many interventions only provided
      information on what constitutes healthier eating or provided discounts on specific
      products.Other interventions were limited in generalizability due to utilization of very
      specific eating establishments or vending machines.By contrast, the investigators propose to
      examine the effectiveness and feasibility of an intervention for promoting increased
      consumption of fruits and vegetables by incentivizing their purchase where the overwhelming
      majority of food is sold: grocery stores. Collaborating with Brown's Super Stores and UpLift
      Solutions leadership, the investigators will enroll shoppers in this Randomized Clinical
      Trial using our the web-based research infrastructure called the Way to Health platform.

      The primary aim of this project is to generate preliminary evidence of the efficacy of two
      financial incentive structures in promoting the allocation of a greater percentage of ones
      grocery budget to the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables (hereafter, produce). Secondary
      aims are to evaluate these interventions effects on (1) self-reported consumption of produce,
      and (2) weight. Salutary goals of this pilot study are to document feasibility of using Price
      Plus cards for incentive studies, and to expand the functionality of the Way Health platform.

    <description>Participants will have access through the Way to Health portal to web-based educational materials and recipes related to healthy eating. They will be informed they will receive up to $50 in reimbursements for completing the surveys that are part of the Way To Eat program as follows: $20 for completing the intake questionnaire and weigh-in and $30 reimbursements for completing the exit questionnaire and weigh-in.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Information provision group will receive the same care as those in the Usual Care arm. In addition, the Information provision group participants will receive weekly reminders about the benefits of eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day and their Way to Health portal will provide graphical depictions of their produce purchase proportions through information from their Price Plus card. This data will be available to them throughout the entire intervention.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving all features of the Information provision treatment the participants assigned to the Information provision + tiered incentive group would earn back increasing percentages of their grocery spending for meeting increasing targets of produce consumption. In this arm, the more participants spend on produce the more money they can earn back.</description>
