  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      administering an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting lethally irradiated whole melanoma cell vaccine
      (&quot;melanoma GVAX&quot;), alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide (CPM), for the
      adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected stage IIB-IV melanoma. Secondarily,
      the investigators will assess in vitro correlates of anti-melanoma immunization by melanoma
      GVAX, including serological and cellular immune responses in patients treated with either the
      vaccine alone or the vaccine given with low dose CPM.

    <description>To determine the side effects and tolerability of administering an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting lethally irradiated whole melanoma cell vaccine (&quot;melanoma GVAX&quot;), alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide, for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected stage IIB-IV melanoma.</description>
