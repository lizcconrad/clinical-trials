      This study is prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods. The volunteers received, in each period, the
      reference or the test formulation, according to the randomization list, under fasting
      conditions, in order to evaluate if the reference and test formulations are bioequivalent.

      This study is prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods. The objective is to confirm if two formulations of
      Amoxicillin trihydrate, in the form powder for oral suspension, are bioequivalent. The test
      product is Amoxicillin trihydrate - Clamoxyl 500mg/5mL (Glaxo Wellcome Production.) in the
      form powder for oral suspension and reference product is Amoxil ® 500mg/5mL (GlaxoSmithKline
      Mexico SA) in the form of powder for oral suspension. Twenty eight healthy volunteers, of
      both genders, were evaluated. The volunteers received, in each period, the reference or the
      test formulation, according to the randomization list, under fasting conditions. In each
      period blood samples are collected in the following times: 0.00 (prior to administration of
      medication); 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00;
      8.00 (after administration of medication). The comparative bioavailability of the two
      formulations was evaluated based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic
      parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations in blood.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve of Plasma Concentration of Drug From Time 0 (Zero) to t (Last Measurable Concentration) (AUC0-t)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hours [hrs]): 0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time (non-compartmental method), after drug administration, is defined as the area under the curve (AUC). AUC0-t is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to time t (the time of the last quantifiable concentration). AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption. ng, nanograms; mL, milliliter.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Concentration of Drug Through Time (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs): 0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as the maximum or &quot;peak&quot; concentration of a drug observed after its administration. Cmax is one of the parameters of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the total amount of drug absorbed. Measurement is obtained directly from the plasma concentration curve of the drug (non-compartmental method).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve of Plasma Concentration of Drug From Time 0 (Zero) Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs):0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods (Day 1 of Period 1[Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of AUC0-inf is obtained directly from the plasma concentration curve of drug against time (non-compartmental method). AUC0-inf is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) extrapolated to infinity, by using the formula AUC0-inf = AUC0-t + Clast/Kel, where Clast is the last measurable concentration, and Kel is the first-order rate constant associated with the terminal portion of the curve. AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption.</description>

    <measure>Time of Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs):0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods: (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>The time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax) is obtained directly from the plasma concentration curve of the drug by non-compartimental method. Tmax is of particular use in measuring bioavailability, by measuring the time at which the maximum concentration is achieved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of AUC0-inf That is Due to Extrapolation From the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration to Infinity (AUC%Extrapolation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs):0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods: (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of AUC0-inf that is due to extrapolation from Tlast to infinity (AUC%Extrapolation) is calculated by using the formula AUC_%extrapolation = 100*(AUC0-inf minus AUC0-t)/AUC0-inf. The function of this parameter is to provide information about what percentage of the theoretical curve (AUC0-inf) was possible to determine experimentally (AUC0-t) Therefore, on average, it is expected that the residual area (AUCextrapolation) is not greater than 20%.</description>

    <measure>Terminal Half-life (T1/2_Kel)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs):0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods: (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>T1/2_Kel is calculated by using the formula T1/2_Kel = Ln(2)/Kel.T1/2 is of particular use in measuring bioavailability, by measuring the elimination of the product.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>First-order Rate Constant Associated With the Terminal Portion of the Curve (Kel)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points (hrs):0.00; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00; 8.00 evaluated in both periods: (Day 1 of Period 1 [Day 1 of study]; Day 1 of Period 2 [Day 15 of study])</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter is estimated via linear regression of time versus log concentration. It allows for the obtainment of estimates of T1/2 (T1/2=ln(2)/Kel) considering the schedule and the detection limits defined.</description>

        <description>The percentage of AUC0-inf that is due to extrapolation from Tlast to infinity (AUC%Extrapolation) is calculated by using the formula AUC_%extrapolation = 100*(AUC0-inf minus AUC0-t)/AUC0-inf. The function of this parameter is to provide information about what percentage of the theoretical curve (AUC0-inf) was possible to determine experimentally (AUC0-t) Therefore, on average, it is expected that the residual area (AUCextrapolation) is not greater than 20%.</description>
