    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6MP in combination with methotrexate in
      patients with breast or ovarian cancer who are known to have a BRCA mutation. 6MP is used
      instead of 6TG as it is converted to the same cytotoxic moiety as 6TG, ie. thioguanine
      nucleotides, but with reduced toxic effects. Low dose methotrexate is used in combination
      with 6MP as it promotes the formation of thioguanine nucleotides.

    <description>1st stage: If less than 3/30 evaluable patients respond at 8 weeks the trial will be stopped for futility. If 3 or more out of 30 evaluable patients respond then a further 35 patients will be recruited (2nd stage).
The proportion of patients responding to treatment will be presented, together with 95% confidence intervals, for Stage 1 and overall, if applicable. This will be repeated separately for patients previously treated with/without PARP inhibitors.</description>
