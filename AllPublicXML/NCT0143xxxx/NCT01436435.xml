      -  To observe the treatment effects of the Jetstream NAVITUS System in long, occluded,
           diffuse, thrombotic or calcified lesions in peripheral arterial disease of the common
           femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal arteries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  The target de novo or restenotic Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) lesion(s)
             is/are located in the common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

          -  The reference vessel lumen (proximal to target lesion) is ≥ 4.0mm.

          -  Evidence of ≥ 70% stenosis or occlusion confirmed by angiography.

          -  Guidewire must cross lesion(s) within the true lumen, without a sub-intimal course
             before the patient is considered as entered into the study.

          -  Patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous intervention using the Jetstream
             NAVITUS System in accordance with its labeled indications and instructions for use.

          -  Lesion length ≥ 4cm.

          -  Patient has a Rutherford category score of 1-3.

          -  Patient has signed approved informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing to comply with the follow-up evaluations at specified times.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has an uncontrollable allergy to nitinol, stainless steel or other stent
             materials or to contrast agent.

          -  Patient is unable to take appropriate anti-platelet therapy.

          -  Patient has no patent distal runoff vessels.

          -  Patient has critical limb ischemia (i.e., Rutherford class 4-6)

          -  Limited vascular access that precludes safe advancement of the Jetstream NAVITUS
             System to the target lesion(s).

          -  Interventional treatment is intended for in-stent restenosis.

          -  Patient has target vessel with moderate or severe angulation (e.g., &gt;30 degrees) or
             tortuosity at the treatment segment.

          -  Patient has a history of coagulopathy or hypercoagulable bleeding disorder.

          -  Patient is receiving hemodialysis or has significantly impaired renal function
             (creatinine is &gt; 2.5 mg/dl) at the time of treatment.

          -  Patient has evidence of intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 3
             months.

          -  Patient has had severe trauma, fracture, major surgery or biopsy of a parenchymal
             organ within the past 14 days.

          -  Patient has had surgical or endovascular procedure in the same vascular territory
             within 30 days prior to the index procedure.

          -  Patient has any planned surgical intervention or endovascular procedure within 30 days
             after the index procedure.

          -  Use of another debulking device during the index procedure prior to the Jetstream
             NAVITUS System will exclude the patient.
