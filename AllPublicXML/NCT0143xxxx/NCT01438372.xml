  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose in
      comparison to oral ferrous sulfate in improving iron deficiency anemia in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is very common among children with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Causes in this population are multi-factorial, including decreased absorption due to
      intestinal disease, increased losses due to bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
      and poor nutrition. IDA can cause significant impaired physical activity and is associated
      with developmental and cognitive abnormalities in children and adolescents. Oral ferrous
      sulfate has been traditionally used to treat iron deficiency anemia, but this is associated
      with limitations. Studies have shown that only a part of the oral iron is absorbed and the
      non-absorbed iron salts can be toxic to the intestinal mucosa, and was also theorized to be
      capable of activating the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Use of intravenous iron sucrose
      has been used in other populations with iron deficiency anemia such as those with chronic
      kidney disease and children with significant blood loss after spinal surgery. The aim of this
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose in improving iron
      deficiency anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease (in comparison to oral ferrous
      sulfate).

    <description>Safety of IV Iron sucrose is evaluated through timely reporting and thorough description of adverse events. Adverse events related to oral ferrous sulfate will also be reported. Study begins on day of randomization. Iron sucrose is administered on days 1, 7, 14, 21. Follow-up visit is done on day 28 and a follow-up visit or phone call is done on day 49. Oral iron will be taken for 28 days. Patients will be seen in clinic on days 1, 7, 14, 21. With same follow-up as IV iron sucrose.</description>

    <description>Efficacy of IV iron sucrose is evaluated through Hb measurement (gm/dl) at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment with intravenous iron sucrose. (increase of 1 gm/dl in 4 weeks is considered significant). This is compared to Hb increase in participants taking oral ferrous sulfate. Study begins on day of randomization. Iron sucrose is administered on days 1, 7, 14, 21. Follow-up visit is done on day 28 and a follow-up visit or phone call is done on day 49. Oral iron will be taken for 28 days. Patients will be seen in clinic on days 1, 7, 14, 21. With same follow-up as IV iron sucrose.</description>

    <description>would like to determine change in iron parameters: change in transferrin saturation, ferritin levels, serum iron binding capacity. Study begins on day of randomization. Participants have been identified approximately a week before. Iron sucrose is administered on days 1, 7, 14, 21. Follow-up visit is done on day 28 and a follow-up visit or phone call is done on day 49. Oral iron will be taken for 28 days. Patients will be seen in clinic on days 1, 7, 14, 21.

    <description>to evaluate effects of oral FeSO4 and IV iron sucrose on clinical disease activity. Crohns disease activity will be measured by the Pediatric Crohns Disease Activity Index. Ulcerative colitis disease activity will be measured by Truelove and Witt's classification of severity of ulcerative colitis. Both will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks. Iron sucrose is administered on days 1, 7, 14, 21. F/u visit is done on day 28 and a f/u visit or phone call is done on day 49. Oral iron will be taken for 28 days.
