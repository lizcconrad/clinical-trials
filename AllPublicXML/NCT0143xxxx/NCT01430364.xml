      Study aims: to compare two intervention strategies for bifurcation treatment - provisional
      T-stenting (PTS) with drug-eluting stent (sirolimus eluting), with kissing balloon inflation
      at the end of procedure - the best treatment strategy at the moment, with stenting of
      bifurcation lesions with dedicated bifurcation drug-eluting stent BiOSS Lym.

      The coronary bifurcation lesions pose a therapeutic problem with high rates of periprocedural
      complications, higher rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. These are lesions
      where stenting is not superior in comparison to balloon angioplasty in regard to side branch.
      It was demonstrated many times, in literature and in daily practice, that angiographically
      high grade ostial side branch stenosis is not flow limiting and do not cause ischemia,
      therefore do not require treatment. From the other side, our own data with magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) before and after bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      demonstrated that occurrence of angiographic stenosis more than 70% in diameter is associated
      with periprocedural myonecrosis in the region of side branch. This fact puts a very important
      question about the mechanisms of this myonecrosis. If the jailed side branch has no
      significant flow limiting stenosis, but there is some degree of residual ischemia, which
      after some period of persistence could lead to myonecrosis, will mean that more aggressive
      treatment of ostial stenosis is needed. It is interesting that the strategy of treatment is
      very important, because techniques with second stent implantation (with primary purpose to
      limit side branch (SB) ischemia) are associated with higher grade of troponin increase. Of
      course this is association and not causality, despite that in randomized study it was
      confirmed also.

      Even after the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary
      bifurcation lesions, important basic problems remain. It was proposed that these problems are
      related to non-dedicated design of conventional stent intended for treatment of straight
      vessel segments. Thus any deformation of the stents during bifurcation implantation depends
      on the stent cell shape, size and material properties (11). To resolve these problems it was
      suggested to make dedicated bifurcation stents (1, 2, 11). However, the special &quot;dedication&quot;
      per se is not defined and unclear as terminology - the stent could be dedicated for patient
      fitting the anatomical characteristics of particular bifurcation point (vessel diameters,
      angulations), giving better hemodynamic conditions; or stent could be dedicated for operator
      to make the procedure quicker and safer, eliminating or limiting SB compromise. Probably the
      best option is the combination of both characteristics.

      The currently available stents on the market generally target the second requirement. Three
      groups of stents are available at this moment - proximal main vessel (MV) stent (Axxess,
      Devax, USA), MV stenting across the SB with different designs making possible permanent
      access to SB and finally purely SB dedicated stents (Tryton, Sideguard, Biguard). Neither of
      these stents did not match proximal - distal MV size difference nor take into account between
      vessel angulations. The device success rate varies considerably (75% - 100%); however the
      study with 100% success was performed in only 11 patients. For all other devices the success
      rate is around 85%. The proximal MV stent and SB only stents require additional stent
      implantation for non-intended vessel. Stents designed to have permanent access to SB are
      implanted over 2 wires, which in reality makes the procedure more difficult and demanding
      rather to simplify it (which was the primary intention of those stents). The reasons are
      wires crisscrossing, wire-bias in proper orientation of device to SB (rotational and axial
      positioning). This, along with requirement of larger guide catheter size explains why the
      dedicated stents do not gain popularity in the interventional cardiology community.

      The BiOSS Lim stent (Balton, Warsaw, Poland) is completely different from the above systems.
      The stent is designed to be user friendly: it tracked over one wire and its profile is quite
      low (1.08mm), which make it possible to implant it even through 5 Fr guiding catheter. The
      stent fits the bifurcation anatomy - it matches the proximal - distal diameters of the main
      vessel (MV); as it permits deformation in its mid-part it can adapt exactly on main vessel -
      main branch angle angle, making wide opening to SB. If the SB must be dilated the stent
      recrossing is very easy, because wider proximal and narrow distal parts give step-down at
      carina tip region, in this way self direct wire to SB. The proximal and distal parts of the
      stent work independently and SB could be safely dilated without need from kissing balloon
      inflation as no deformation of contralateral wall strut. This simplifies and shortens the
      procedure. And finally, the stent construction prevents carina displacement, as a basic
      mechanism of side branch compromise.

      Study aims: to compare two intervention strategies for bifurcation treatment - provisional
      T-stenting (PTS) with drug-eluting stent (sirolimus eluting), with kissing balloon inflation
      at the end of procedure - the best treatment strategy at the moment, with stenting of
      bifurcation lesions with dedicated bifurcation drug-eluting stent BiOSS Lym.
