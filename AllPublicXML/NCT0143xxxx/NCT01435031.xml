TIMI Classification:
TIMI 0 No perfusion.
TIMI 1 Penetration with minimal perfusion. Contrast fails to opacify the entire bed distal to the stenosis for the duration of the cine run.
TIMI 2 Partial perfusion. Contrast opacifies the entire coronary bed distal to the stenosis. However, the rate of entry and/or clearance is slower in the coronary bed distal to the obstruction than in comparable areas not perfused by the dilated vessel.
TIMI 3 Complete perfusion. Filling and clearance of contrast equally rapid in the coronary bed distal to stenosis as in other coronary beds.</description>

    <description>Device success and absence of in-hospital MACE.
Per-protocol MI definition: Myocardial infarctions per protocol definition were categorized as Q-wave (development of new, pathological Q waves on the ECG) or non-Q-wave (elevation of CK levels to greater than two times the upper limit of normal and elevated CK-MB in the absence of new pathological Q waves).
Per ARC MI definition: Myocardial infarctions per ARC definition were also categorized as Q-wave (development of new pathological Q waves in 2 or more contiguous leads (according to the Minnesota code) with or without post-procedure CK or CK-MB levels elevated above normal) or non-Q-wave (all MIs not classified as Q-wave). ARC defined MIs were further classified as Periprocedural PCI, Periprocedural CABG, Spontaneous, Sudden Death, and Reinfarction based on biomarker and additional criteria and as ST Elevation MI (STEMI) or Non-ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI) based on ST segment.</description>

         13. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months

         14. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months

         15. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or refusal of blood transfusions

         16. Patients with any other pathology such as cancer, mental illness, etc., which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, might put the patient at risk, preclude follow-up, or in
             any way confound the results of the study.

         17. Known previous medical condition yielding expected survival less than 1 year.

         18. Patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol or not expected to
             complete the study period, including its follow-up requirements.

         19. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), or
             other coronary artery imaging procedures

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

        Candidates will be excluded from study if any of the following conditions are met:

          1. Occlusion involves segment within previous stent

          2. Extensive lesion-related thrombus (TIMI thrombus grade 3 or 4)

          3. Previous stenting (drug-eluting or bare metal) in the target vessel unless the
             following conditions are met:

               -  It has been at least 9 months since the previous stenting.

               -  That target lesion is at least 15 mm away from the previously placed stent.

               -  The previously stented segment (stent plus 5 mm on either side) has no more than
                  40% diameter stenosis.

          4. The target vessel has other lesions proximal to the total occlusion identified with
             greater than 40% diameter stenosis based on visual estimate or on-line quantitative
             coronary angiography (QCA). However, planned stenting of the lesion in target vessel
             which is proximal to the target lesion and can be covered by a single stent (ie,
             tandem lesions) are acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria (Non-target Lesion):

          1. The lesion is located in a native vessel distal to anastomosis with a graft.

          2. The vessel has other lesions with greater than 40% diameter stenosis based on visual
             estimate or on-line QCA.

          3. The vessel has evidence of thrombus.

          4. The vessel is excessively tortuous.

          5. The lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               -  Lesion location is aorto-ostial, an unprotected left main lesion, or within 5 mm
                  of the origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), left
                  circumflex coronary artery (LCX), or right coronary artery (RCA).

               -  Involves a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter.

               -  Is at or distal to a &gt; 45º bend in the vessel.

               -  Is moderately to severely calcified.

               -  TIMI flow 0 or 1.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 250 subjects were enrolled in 20 sites from September 13, 2011 to February 7, 2013. Twenty-eight participants were excluded from ITT (N=222) in whom recanalization and pre-dilatation of the target lesion were not completed and/or study stent was not inserted into the coronary guiding catheter.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>ITT set included 222 subjects who met entry criteria, were enrolled in the trial and whose target lesion was successfully crossed and predilated. PP set included all ITT subjects (N = 183) in whom at least 1 study stent was implanted,met procedure success,had follow-up data and had no major protocol deviations due to inappropriate enrollment.</pre_assignment_details>

TIMI 2 Partial perfusion. Contrast opacifies the entire coronary bed distal to the stenosis. However, the rate of entry and/or clearance is slower in the coronary bed distal to the obstruction than in comparable areas not perfused by the dilated vessel.

Per ARC MI definition: Myocardial infarctions per ARC definition were also categorized as Q-wave (development of new pathological Q waves in 2 or more contiguous leads (according to the Minnesota code) with or without post-procedure CK or CK-MB levels elevated above normal) or non-Q-wave (all MIs not classified as Q-wave).

Death is divided into 2 categories:
Cardiac death is defined as death due to any of the following:
Acute MI
Cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade
Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality
Stroke within 30 days of the procedure or stroke suspected of being related to the procedure
Death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery
Any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
Non-cardiac death is defined as a death not due to cardiac causes (as defined above).</description>

Cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade
Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality
Stroke within 30 days of the procedure or stroke suspected of being related to the procedure
Death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery
