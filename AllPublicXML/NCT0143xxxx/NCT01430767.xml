  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence is a common reason for treatment failure in many fields of medicine, and
      likely affects common psychiatric treatments as well. Members of the present study team have
      used Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS速) caps effectively to objectively monitor
      adherence in skin disease, and have shown that they provide a much more accurate measure of
      adherence behavior than self-reports, pill counts, or serum drug concentrations. The present
      study will use MEMS速 caps to measure adherence in 10 patients with depression and 10 patients
      with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from a student clinic population. The
      aims will be to show the usefulness of MEMS速 caps in measuring adherence to psychiatric
      treatment, and gather data on typical adherence rates for depression and ADHD patients on
      typical treatment regimens. The data obtained will be used to inform future studies that use
      an intervention to improve adherence behavior and ultimately disease outcomes.

        Twenty male and female subjects, ten with depression and ten with ADHD, will be recruited.
        Subjects will be recruited from the Student Health Clinic at Wake Forest University, as we
        plan to assess adherence in a typical population of college students with depression or
        ADHD.

             (Patients who are on a stable dose of non-study-related prescription medications for
