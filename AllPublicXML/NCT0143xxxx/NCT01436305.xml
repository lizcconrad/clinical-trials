  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess whether a new drug, Nulojix® (belatacept), would
      minimize serious long term side effects associated with anti-rejection medications while
      still protecting the new kidney from damage. The researchers also wanted to learn more about
      the safety of this treatment and long term health of the transplanted kidney.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis or kidney transplant are the two ways to treat kidney failure. Transplant recipients
      have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the body's natural
      defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who undergo a
      kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives.
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications
      that work just as well, but don't damage the kidney.

          -  Flow-based PRA within last 12 months (in absence of a sensitizing event) of &lt; 30% as
             determined by each participating study center. If the subject experienced a
             sensitizing event after the PRA test date, then the PRA must be repeated and confirmed
             &lt;30%;

          -  Negative crossmatch or a PRA of 0% on historic and admission sera as determined by
             each participating study center.

          -  A documented negative TB test within the 12 months prior to transplant. If
             documentation is not present at the time of transplantation, and the subject does not
             have any risk factors for TB, a TB-specific interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) may
             be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Need for multi-organ transplant;

          -  Recipient of previous organ transplant;

          -  EBV sero-negative (or unknown) recipients;

          -  Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV;

          -  Individuals who have required treatment with prednisone or other immunosuppressive
             drugs within 1 year prior to transplant;

          -  Individuals undergoing transplant using organs from extended criteria donor (ECD) or
             donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors;

          -  HLA identical living donors;

          -  Individuals at significant risk of early recurrence of the primary renal disease
             including FSGS and MPGN type 2 or any other disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator is at increased likelihood of recurrence and which may result in rapid
             decline in renal function;

          -  Individuals previously treated with NULOJIX® (belatacept);

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with study requirements;

          -  Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of enrollment;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or any of the drug's components;

          <title>Count of Participants With Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt; 60 mL/Min/1.73 m^2 by CKD EPI</title>
          <description>GFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI). A score of ≥90 means kidney function is normal. A score between 60 and 89 indicates mildly reduced kidney function, pointing to kidney disease. Scores between 30 and 59 indicates moderately reduced kidney function. Scores between 15 and 29 indicate severely reduced kidney function. Scores below 15 indicate very severe or endstage kidney failure. This measure specifically looked at participants with scores less than 60.</description>

        <description>The stages of Chronic Kidney Disease are defined using the participant's GFR value as indicated below.
Stage 1 if GFR value is ≥90; Stage 2 if 60 ≤ GFR &lt; 90; Stage 3A if 45 ≤ GFR &lt; 60; Stage 3B if 30 ≤ GFR &lt; 45; Stage 4 if 15 ≤ GFR &lt; 30; Stage 5 if GFR &lt; 15.
Stage 1 means kidney function is normal. Stage 2 indicates mildly reduced kidney function, pointing to kidney disease. Stages 3A abd 3B indicate moderately reduced kidney function. Stage 4 indicates severely reduced kidney function. Stage 5 indicates very severe or end stage kidney failure.</description>

Maintenance: Starting on the day of surgery or post-operative day one, participants underwent maintenance therapy.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was given at a dose of 1000 mg by mouth twice a day of which was adjusted as clinically warranted. Mycophenolate sodium could be used to replace MMF at a dose 720 mg by mouth twice a day.
Methylprednisone was administered at a dose of 500 mg on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg day 1 post-transplant, 125 mg day 2 post-transplant, 60 mg day 3 post-transplant, 30 mg day 4 post-transplant.
Tacrolimus was given at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg twice a day by mouth, which was adjusted to target trough levels of 8-12 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks post-transplant, then adjusted to target trough levels of 5-8 ng/ml thereafter.</description>

        <title>The Slope of eGFR by CKD-EPI Over Time Based on Serum Creatinine</title>
        <description>The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI). A score of ≥90 means kidney function is normal. A score between 60 and 89 indicates mildly reduced kidney function, pointing to kidney disease. Scores between 30 and 59 indicates moderately reduced kidney function. Scores between 15 and 29 indicate severely reduced kidney function. Scores below 15 indicate very severe or endstage kidney failure. An estimate of the slope, or change over time, in eGFR was produced using standard statistical linear modeling procedures. The estimate was then re-scaled so that it can be interpreted as a change in eGFR per month. Positive numbers indicate increasing kidney function. Larger numbers indicate greater change in kidney function.</description>

        <description>Acute cellular rejection is when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection for this endpoint is defined as a grade ≥ IA by Banff 2007 criteria. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe form of cellular rejection. Originally, this endpoint was worded as “The severity of first and highest acute cellular rejection within the first 52 weeks.” But since the highest grade for each subject coincided with the first ACR episode for each subject, only a summary of severity of the first episode is presented here.</description>

          <title>Count of Participants by Severity of First Acute Cellular Rejection by Wk 52</title>
          <description>Acute cellular rejection is when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection for this endpoint is defined as a grade ≥ IA by Banff 2007 criteria. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe form of cellular rejection. Originally, this endpoint was worded as “The severity of first and highest acute cellular rejection within the first 52 weeks.” But since the highest grade for each subject coincided with the first ACR episode for each subject, only a summary of severity of the first episode is presented here.</description>

        <description>New onset diabetes is the development of diabetes post-kidney transplant. It was identified by the clinical sites caring for each participant and reported directly in the clinical database. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a determination made by referencing glucose measurements obtained from a standard chemistry panel. Any fasting glucose measure that is between 110 and 125 mg/dL is classified as IFG.

        <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement at Wk 52</title>
        <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart. Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal. Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension). Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>

          <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement at Wk 52</title>
          <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart. Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal. Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension). Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>
