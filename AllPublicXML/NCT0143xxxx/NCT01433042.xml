  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis: PillCam SB3 is a new capsule designed to provide an improved image quality,
      and improved SB and duodenum tissue coverage due to Adaptive Frame Rate (AFR) of 2-6 fps,
      which will create more images for evaluation, and therefore should improve diagnostic
      accuracy.

      Proposed Design: to enroll up to 230 patients with symptoms suggesting the presence of small
      bowel disease.

      Preparation for procedure will include 12 hours fasting prior to the capsule ingestion

      Patients will undergo a standard capsule endoscopy. Patients will be allowed to drink clear
      liquids 2 hours post ingestion, and eat 4 hours post ingestion.

      Diagnostic yield of the SB3 will be calculated The Physician's subjective assessment of
      capsule performance will be captured

      -  Purpose of study- To assess the performance of PillCam SB3 capsule in detecting small
           bowel lesions in patients

        -  Study design- Feasibility study

        -  Number of subjects- Up to 200

        -  Subject population- Patients with symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease and whom
           are eligible and indicated for SB capsule endoscopy

        -  No of centers- 4

        -  Duration of enrollment up to 12 months from IRB approval to enroll study patients

        -  Duration of follow-up 1 week after capsule procedure.

        -  Primary objectives To evaluate the performance of SB-3 system in patients as per
