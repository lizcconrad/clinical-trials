  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many patients with blood cancers, stem cell transplantation from a family member or from
      an unrelated donor remains the only potentially curative option. Unfortunately, up to 40% of
      patients develop chronic lung disease after the transplant, which substantially increases the
      risk of death in the long-term. Currently, patients with transplant-related lung disease are
      treated with some combination of steroids and other immunosuppressant drugs, but only about 1
      out of 5 improve.

      The importance of our study is that the investigators aim to prevent the development of
      transplant-related chronic lung disease in the first place. Because a strong risk factor for
      such chronic lung disease is a prior viral respiratory tract infection, the investigators
      think there is a window of opportunity to intervene. As soon as &quot;cold and flu&quot; symptoms
      start, the investigators will treat patients with a combination of drugs aimed at eliminating
      damaging immune responses triggered by the virus. In the absence of such treatment, the
      investigators believe these lung-damaging immune responses would persist even after the virus
      disappears. Our hope is that preventive treatment might avoid the development of chronic lung
      disease, and this would substantially increase long-term survival in our transplant patients.

      This is a pilot study. Once feasibility is established, the investigators will seek to expand
      this study into a definitive clinical trial.

    <description>The incidence rate of new non-infectious pulmonary complications within the 6 month follow-up period will be calculated. Non-infectious pulmonary complications include new airflow obstruction, new restrictive lung disease, and new mixed obstruction/restriction as measured by spirometry at study enrolment, 2 and 8 weeks following viral infection, and by full pulmonary function tests at 3 and 6 weeks following viral infection.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months following the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infection</time_frame>
    <description>Non-infectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs) include airflow obstruction, restrictive lung disease, and mixed obstruction/restriction as determined by pulmonary function tests. The prevalence of NIPCs will be determined among subjects surviving to 6 months post viral respiratory tract infection.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of bacterial or fungal superinfection</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 21 days after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal pneumonias will be compared in the two arms, to verify that the added immunosuppression does not contribute to further infectious complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of various other infectious complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of various other infectious complications, specifically including but not limited to CMV reactivations and CMV disease, zoster, and septicemia will be monitored in both arms.</description>
