    <textblock>
      Breast cancer triples negatives (TN; 15 % of the cases) are characterized by a high
      histoprognostic grade, a strong proliferation, a strong metastatic power, and a worse
      prognosis than the other forms of breast cancer. It is however a heterogenous group for
      histological and molecular level, but also for evolution. Most of the TN is part of the basal
      breast cancer subcategory. Until now, the medical treatment is based on chemotherapy.

      Breast cancers by constitutional mutation of BRCA1 / BRCA2 (5 % of breast cancers) are mostly
      of basal type and their prognostic seems better that what could be expected from high grade
      tumours and without hormonal receptors. They would be much more frequent in the TN group.
      However, at this day, no prospective study was led to estimate this incidence, or to study
      the intervention of other genes of predisposition, as well to analyse the links between this
      phenotype and their consequences at the germinal or somatic level, in terms of associated
      molecular changes and prognosis.

      The purpose of this study is, on a prospective study, to lead a joined analysis at the
      germinal level, in search of mutations of the main genes of breast cancer predisposition
      (BRCA1/2, PALB2, PTEN, PALB2), and at the tumour level (tissue micro-array and
      transcriptome), by correlating these results to the main clinical parameters.

      The 5 years relapse-free survival will also be estimated.
