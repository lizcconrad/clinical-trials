  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to analyze the surgical treatment of low back pain due to degenerative
      kyphoscoliosis, already routinely performed on patients treated in Istituto Ortopedico
      Rizzoli, in terms of reduction of the pain and functional improvement. The comparison of back
      pain and functional ability before and after the surgical treatment will be performed by
      administering to the patients specific questionnaires (Visual Analog Score VAS, Oswestry
      Disability Index ODI, Quality of Life EuroQoL 5D). Questionnaires administration will be
      matched to a purely objective and radiological assessment according to international
      guidelines. A psychological analysis will be also performed in order to evaluate co-morbidity
      from this field, considering that the concept of &quot;shared decision-making&quot; for the therapeutic
      approach to low back pain requires the evaluation of all these parameters.

    <description>The clinical status of the patients will be evaluated before surgery and at 1-3-6-12 months of follow up (and then annually) by: 1. Visual Analog Scale (VAS); 2. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); 3. Quality of life (EuroQoL 5D) test.</description>

    <measure>Change from the baseline radiographic status at 1-3-6-12 months after the surgical treatment for degenerative scoliosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery, 1-3-6-12 months after surgery, then annually</time_frame>
    <description>The correction of the deformity with respect to the pre-operative status will be assessed by anteroposterior, bending and lateral full standing radiographs at 1-3-6-12 months of follow up (and then annually). Flexion/extension radiographs will be taken at 1-3-6-12 months after surgery in order to evaluate fusion and proper positioning of hardware. Successful arthrodesis (fusion) will be also confirmed by CT scan at 1 year.
Criteria of fusion evaluation:
Fusion certain
Fusion likely
Status uncertain
Pseudo arthrosis likely
Pseudo arthrosis certain</description>

    <description>The psychological state of the patients will be evaluate before the surgical treatment and at 1-3-6-12 months after surgery (then annually).
To evaluate the psychological state of the patients the following questionnaires will be used:
STAI to evaluate the anxiety state
ZHUNG to evaluate the depressive state</description>

    <description>Major and minor surgical complications will be recorded and analysed during the perioperative period (early complications) and at 1-3-6-12 months after surgery (late complications).</description>
