    <textblock>
      This study will assess safety as well as establish a Recommended Phase II dose of the
      combination of panobinostat and ruxolitinib in patients with or without the JAK2V617F
      mutation who have been diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), Post Essential
      Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (PET MF), or Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (PPV MF).
