      The purpose of this study is to determine a suitable dose of the human norovirus GII.4
      challenge pool(CIN-1;031693) that induces illness in approximately 50% of susceptible
      subjects that would be useful for evaluation of vaccines and antivirals.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>

          3. Able to comply with all study procedures

          4. Have a serum antibody titer of &lt; 1:1600 to the GII.4 challenge strain of Norovirus as
             measured by ELISA

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative urine pregnancy tests, at
             screen and prior to challenge

          6. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential, or if of childbearing potential
             (as determined by investigator) must be practicing abstinence or using an effective
             licensed method of birth control (e.g. oral contraception; diaphragm or condom in
             combination with contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; intrauterine contraceptive
             device, or hormonal devices/injections (for example, NORPLANT® or DEPO-PROVERA®) from
             screening through one month after completing inpatient stay.

          7. Have normal screening laboratories for SGPT (ALT), creatinine, sodium, potassium,
             total white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets,
             urine protein, urine glucose and urine RBCs (see table below) as well as negative
             stool culture for known bacterial pathogens and stool evaluation for parasites.

          8. For challenged subjects: Be secretor positive for HBGA binding by assay of their
             saliva. For placebo recipients: Be secretor negative for HBGA binding by assay of
             their saliva.

          9. Score at least 70% on a test of understanding of this research study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Expected to be noncompliant with study procedures or planning to move within the
             anticipated total duration of the study (180 days after challenge)

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  HIV positive (by history or screening antibody test)

          -  Hepatitis B positive (by history or a positive hepatitis B surface antigen)

          -  Hepatitis C positive (by history or a positive antibody to hepatitis C virus)

          -  Norovirus GII.4 serum antibody screening titer of &gt; 1:1600

          -  Clinically significant findings on history or physical examination

             &lt;90, respiratory rate &gt;16/min. If heart rate &lt;55 beats per minute and investigator
             determines that this is not clinically significant and heart rate increases &gt; 55 beats
             per minute on moderate exercise (two flights of stairs), subject will not be excluded.
             Vital signs may be repeated at screening.

          -  Clinically significant history of diseases or treatments that may affect the immune
             system's function such as a past history of cancer, receipt of chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy, or autoimmune diseases (exception; a history of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma in remission without treatment for more than 5 years prior to
             study entry)
