    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 to 5 months of three treatments ―
      omalizumab, corticosteroid therapy boost, and placebo ― in reducing fall exacerbations in
      inner-city children and adolescents with allergic persistent asthma when initiated
      approximately 4 -6 weeks prior to the start of the first day of each participant's school
      year.

    <textblock>
      While the increase in the prevalence of asthma has abated, levels of asthma morbidity and
      mortality remain near record highs. An asthma exacerbation is a major factor contributing to
      morbidity, and even mortality in patients with asthma. Although current approaches to
      treatment have reduced these risks, asthma exacerbations are major problems for inner-city
      patients and their families, and prevention of these events continues to be a significant
      challenge. In children with asthma, there are predictable seasonal epidemics of
      exacerbations, especially during the fall season, otherwise known as the &quot;September
      epidemic.&quot;

    <time_frame>90 Day outcome period</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma exacerbation defined as a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the first day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following minimum dosage: prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone at ≥ 20mg per day for 3 of any 5 consecutive days; or dexamethasone at ≥10mg per day for ≥1 day. Odds ratio comparing Placebo and Omalizumab arms across all treatment steps (Steps 2-5).</description>

    <time_frame>90 Day outcome period</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma exacerbation:defined by a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the 1st day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following minimum dosage: prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone at ≥ 20mg per day for 3 of any 5 consecutive days; or dexamethasone at ≥ 10mg per day for ≥1 day. Exacerbations were then associated with viral respiratory infections based on nasal mucus samples collected monthly. Nasal mucus samples were categorized as having exacerbations or not having exacerbations. Participants could potentially be counted in each group, as participants could have samples with exacerbations and samples without exacerbations.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Asthma Symptoms Associated With a Viral Infection:Omalizumab vs. Placebo</measure>

    <description>Severity asthma symptoms is defined as the highest value among the following 3 variables: number of days with wheezing, tightness in the chest, or cough; number of nights with disturbed sleep as a result of asthma; and number of days on which a participant had to slow down or discontinue play/physical activities over a two week period associated with a viral infection. This outcome looks at the effect by group on number of days with asthma symptoms and infections. The hypothesis behind this outcome measure is that omalizumab will change virology; thus, the the intent of this measure was to assess the comparator group of placebo against omalizumab</description>

        <description>Asthma exacerbation defined as a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the first day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following minimum dosage: prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone at ≥ 20mg per day for 3 of any 5 consecutive days; or dexamethasone at ≥10mg per day for ≥1 day.

        <title>Virus-induced Exacerbations as Measured by an Exacerbation That is Associated With a Virus Detected Using the Nasal Mucus Samples</title>
        <description>Asthma exacerbation:defined by a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the 1st day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following minimum dosage: prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone at ≥ 20mg per day for 3 of any 5 consecutive days; or dexamethasone at ≥ 10mg per day for ≥1 day. Exacerbations were then associated with viral respiratory infections based on nasal mucus samples collected monthly. Nasal mucus samples were categorized as having exacerbations or not having exacerbations. Participants could potentially be counted in each group, as participants could have samples with exacerbations and samples without exacerbations.</description>

        <description>Severity asthma symptoms is defined as the highest value among the following 3 variables: number of days with wheezing, tightness in the chest, or cough; number of nights with disturbed sleep as a result of asthma; and number of days on which a participant had to slow down or discontinue play/physical activities over a two week period associated with a viral infection. This outcome looks at the effect by group on number of days with asthma symptoms and infections.

        <description>CASI scores include 5 domains: day symptoms and albuterol use, night symptoms and albuterol use, controller treatment, lung function measures, and exacerbations. To calculate CASI, the 5 domain scores are summed to determine a final score, which can range from 0 to 20, with 0 being no severity of asthma and 20 being extremely severe asthma.</description>

          <description>The FEV1 (forced expiratory volume 1))/ FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio is used to evaluate airways obstructions since pure restrictive ventilatory defects cause an equal reduction in the FEV1 and the FVC. An FEV1/FVC ratio below 80% indicates airflow obstruction. Normal FEV1/FVC: 8 – 19 years of age=85%.</description>

        <description>Outcome measure description: The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a validated tool to assess asthma control (over the last 4 weeks) in patients ≥12 yrs old. It is comprised of 5 questions assessing symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the impact of asthma on everyday functioning. All questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (higher score indicating better control). Total scores can range from 5-25. A score of ≤19 is indicative of not well-controlled asthma. The minimally important difference is 3 points.</description>

        <description>Residential environmental exposure to cockroach allergen of participants in the context of the risk of asthma exacerbations and effect of omalizumab versus placebo (control) on asthma exacerbations was explored. Presence of cockroach allergen in household dust samples was assessed. Exacerbation defined as: participant required either 1.)a prescribed course of systemic steroids by a clinician2.)initiation of a course of systemic steroids or 3.)a hospitalization during the fall outcome period (90 day period beginning on the first day of the participant's school year) to prevent a serious asthma outcome. In cases that a participant initiated and completed a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, the course was counted as an exacerbation only with fulfillment of the following minimum dosage: prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone at ≥20mg per day for 3 of any 5 consecutive days; or dexamethasone at ≥10mg per day for ≥1 day).</description>
