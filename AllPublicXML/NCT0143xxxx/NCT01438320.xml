  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is a serious chronic condition in the United States affecting
      millions of people and is the cause of rates of hepatocellular carcinoma recently doubling in
      the US. Treatment of hepatitis C is proven to be an effective secondary prevention of liver
      cancer. Current standard antiviral treatments exclude 70-80% of hepatitis C patients from
      therapies due to intolerable side effects. Our laboratory efforts identified a potential
      novel approach to hepatitis C treatment and hepatocellular carcinoma prevention with
      Quercetin, a heat shock protein inhibitor.

      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Quercetin in hepatitis C
      patients who have contraindications to standard antiviral treatment (both treatment naïve
      patients who decline standard therapy, patients who previously had standard treatments with
      relapse, as well as those who had intolerable side effects previously). The investigators
      recently demonstrated that the flavonoid Quercetin inhibits hepatitis C viral production in
      tissue culture, at least partially through its inhibition of heat shock protein expression.
      This represents a novel mechanism for treating hepatitis C infection. Quercetin also has low
      toxicity. These promising characteristics motivate the proposed Phase I study. Patients will
      be recruited through the UCLA Pfleger Liver Institute and treated on an outpatient basis.
      Toxicity will be closely monitored and reported. Viral load response will be evaluated as a
      secondary endpoint. The anticipated total number of patients enrolled in the trial will be
      20. All patients will be followed for 8 months after taking this first dose of study
      medication. Patients exhibiting a viral load response will have extended follow-up, ranging
      from a total follow-up of 12-24 months, to determine persistence of this response.

    <description>Primary outcome for the study will be safety. The investigators will track various laboratory parameters including viral loads and see patients every 2 weeks during our drug phase which is 28 days. After that follow patients every month to see how long antiviral activity will persist if we do see a positive outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hepatitis C Viral Load Assessment with Quercetin Given Over 28 days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days during drug phase. Possibly this could go further for 32 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatitis C viral load will be monitored every 2 wks during the first 28 days when patients are taking Quercetin. After this period, if there is a positive antiviral activity that is seen, we continue to monitor viral load every month to see how long this effect will last.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants will have detectable HCV RNA in serum; stable viral load within the
             previous year (no fluctuation &gt; 2 log scale).

          -  All participants are either treatment-naïve and unwilling to be treated with standard
             HCV therapies, or were not able to tolerate hepatitis C antiviral due to side effects
             and completed treatment more than 6 months prior to enrollment into our trial.

          -  Age range will be from 18-65 years old

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 months

          -  Participants must have:

               -  INR &lt;1.2

               -  Alpha Feto-protein &lt;50 ng/mL

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  All participants must exhibit the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
             written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are currently on interferon +/- ribavirin or any other anti-viral
             therapies are excluded from our study. Participants who have previously been treated
             with hepatitis C antiviral therapy must have recovered from any adverse events due to
             the agent(s) administered. In addition, their last antiviral therapy must be more than
             six months prior to their enrollment in our study

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Participants with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis will be excluded from this
             trial

          -  According to a monogram published by the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database,
             drug interactions with Quercetin have been reported to occur with quinolone
             antibiotics and inhibition of p-glycoprotein or various cytochrome P450 enzymes
             including CYP3A4/ CYP2C8/ CYP2C9/ CYP2D6. Quercetin interactions with drugs can be
             categorized into (1) moderate interaction to be avoided based on healthy volunteer
             studies and (2) moderate interaction to be monitored closely based on in vitro studies
             demonstrating potential theoretical reduced elimination and increased effects.

             excluded from our study.

          -  In addition, participants with any other known hepatitis etiologies (hepatitis B
             co-infection, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson Disease,
