    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the investigators understanding of the relationship
      between Crohn's disease and blood levels of the drug infliximab (Remicade). The investigators
      want to determine whether measuring drug levels can be helpful in understanding how patients
      respond to this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of infliximab to maintain remission in Crohn's disease has been confirmed by
      randomized, controlled trials, however the utility of serum infliximab and ATI titers is less
      clearly described in the clinical practice setting to manage dose and interval levels.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical responsiveness of active (HBI
      &gt;10) Crohn's disease to infliximab as it relates to serum infliximab levels. Though the assay
      for an infliximab level is commercially available, current dosing practices rely on the
      assessment of clinical data (laboratory data, symptoms, colonoscopy, etc). In order to
      understand this relationship, serum infliximab and ATI titers will be collected over the
      course of 8 (approximately 1 year) infusions. The results of these levels will be
      retrospectively correlated to the patient's clinical response to treatment.

      The secondary objective is to identify predictors of poor response to infliximab by
      evaluating the efficacy of a dose escalation strategy in patients classified as primary or
      secondary non-responders.

      Understanding the association of serum infliximab levels to disease response may be a useful
      objective tool to optimize and individualize dosing amount and frequency especially in
      patients with incomplete or loss of response to therapy.
