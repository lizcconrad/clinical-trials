  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration in patients
      undergoing hepatic resection remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of
      oral supplementation with BCAA on the prevention for the development of liver tumorigenesis
      in patients undergoing liver resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study might demonstrate a tendency of the improvement in the cumulative tumor recurrence
      rate after hepatectomy for liver neoplasm in the Livact group compared to that in the Control
      Group. The investigators believe that BCAA seems to be a remarkable benefit for liver
      resection, especially on its reduction in the recurrence of liver cancer. This treatment
      regimen has potential to offer benefits for clinical use selectively, especially for patients
      with chronic liver diseases.
