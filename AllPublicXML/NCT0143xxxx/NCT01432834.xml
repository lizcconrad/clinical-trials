    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of the Allegretto Wave excimer laser and
      the wavefront optimized ablation profile in correcting primarily non-anterior astigmatism
      faults, following laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

      Different optical components of the eye contribute to the total astigmatism error.In
      specific, the anterior corneal surface is responsible for the anterior component of
      astigmatism fault (anterior astigmatism), while the posterior corneal surface and the lens
      are responsible for the posterior one (posterior astigmatism).

      Regarding our study, 74 refractive surgery candidates were recruited. Only one eye from each
      candidate was randomly enrolled in the study. Of them, 40 eyes underwent LASIK treatment (LG
      group), while 34 eyes underwent PRK treatment (PG group). The Allegretto Wave excimer laser
      (software version: 2.020 / WaveLight AG, Erlangen, Germany) was used for the ablation in all
      groups. Preoperatively, the ocular residual astigmatism (ORA) was calculated for each eye,
      according to which each astigmatism fault was characterized as primarily anterior or
      non-anterior.ORA is the vectorial value of astigmatism arising from non-anterior sources. Its
      amount on total astigmatism (R) is determined by the magnitude ratio ORA/R. Ratios below 1
      indicate primarily anterior astigmatism, while ratios above 1 indicate primarily non-anterior
      astigmatism. 20 LG eyes and 16 PG eyes presented primarily anterior astigmatism (LG-A and
      PG-A subgroups, respectively), while 20 LG eyes and 18 PG eyes demonstrated primarily
      non-anterior astigmatism (LG-NA and PG-NA subgroups, respectively). Postoperatively, vector
      analysis of astigmatism correction was conducted; The following indexes were calculated: a)
      Correction index (CI), b) Difference vector (DV) and c) Index of Success (IOS).

    <description>Vector analysis of astigmatism correction was conducted using preoperative and 6-month postoperative data. The following indexes were calculated: a) Correction index (CI) which is determined by the ratio of the surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) to the target induced astigmatism (TIA), b) Difference vector (DV) as an absolute measure of success, and, c) Index of Success (IOS) which is determined by the relationship of the DV to the TIA, as a relative measure of success.</description>

    <description>During LASIK treatments the Carriazo-Pendular microkeratome (SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Kleinostheim, Germany) with 130Î¼m cutting head was used for the creation of the flap. The normal value of the negative pressure of the suction ring was between 600-620 mmHg and the velocity of the head movement was constant (3mm/sec). The hinge was created at the 12 o'clock position. The Allegretto Wave excimer laser (software version: 2.020 / WaveLight AG, Erlangen, Germany) was used for all ablations. Attempted ablations were modified according to the &quot;S001 Wellington&quot; nomogram for the &quot;wavefront optimised&quot; protocol.</description>

    <description>The same surgical procedure was applied to all PG participants that included: Instillation of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% drops for topical anaesthesia, application of a sponge saturated with 10% alcohol to the central cornea for 20-30 seconds and subsequent de-epithelialization by means of a hockey knife.The Allegretto Wave excimer laser (software version: 2.020 / WaveLight AG, Erlangen, Germany) was used for all ablations. Attempted ablations were modified according to the &quot;S001 Wellington&quot; nomogram for the &quot;wavefront optimised&quot; protocol. A soft therapeutic lens was applied until complete re-epithelialization of the cornea was detected.</description>
