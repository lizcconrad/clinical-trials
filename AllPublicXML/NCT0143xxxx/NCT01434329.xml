      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies DNA in samples from patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with overall survival
           (OS) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with normal cytogenetics.

        -  To develop and evaluate in an independent validation set a prognostic score for OS based
           on the identified DMR.

        -  To determine whether the prognostic score can group patients into risk groups based on
           OS.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood or bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA methylation alterations
      by CHARM array-based genome assay. Each patient's clinical data is also collected.
