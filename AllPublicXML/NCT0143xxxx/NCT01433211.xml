      Nutrition is regarded as an important etiologic factor in the development of frailty in older
      adults. To date the relation between nutrition and frailty is only poorly described.

      Thus, it is the purpose of this study to investigate the association between different
      nutrition characteristics and frailty in older community-living persons.

      206 volunteers aged 75 years or older were included in this cross-sectional study.
      Nutritional assessment included the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), a food-frequency
      questionnaire and a standardised three-day dietary record. Intake of energy and nutrients was
      calculated using the German nutrient database BLS II.2. Dietary patterns were described by
      different dietary scores. Frailty was defined according to Fried et al. based on the
      following criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, walking speed and physical
      activity. In addition several standardised tests were performed to characterise physical
      performance (Timed Up &amp; Go, repeated chair stands, balance tests).

      The association between nutritional aspects and physical performance is evaluated in an
      explorative manner.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty (according to Fried et al.)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is defined as the presence of at least 3 of the following criteria:
self-reported weight loss of more than 4.5 kg in the last year
exhaustion (self-reported feeling that everything was an effort or one could not get &quot;going&quot; &gt; 2 times a week)
low grip strength (men ≤ 29-32 kg, women ≤ 17-21 kg depending on BMI),
low walking speed (&gt; 6-7 sec/ 4.57 m, depending on gender and height)
low physical activity (men &lt; 383 kcal/ week, women &lt; 270 kcal/ week)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impaired physical performance (according to Guralnik et al.)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Impaired physical performance is definded as less than 9 points in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).
Three physical performance tests (balance, walking speed and chair-rise) are performed in a standardised manner and rated with 0-4 points each. SPPB is the sum score of these three test resuslts with a maximum of 12 points indicating the best physical performance.</description>
