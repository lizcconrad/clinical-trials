  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is planned as a feasibility study. The objective is to evaluate a specially designed
      patient adherence and monitoring software on standard mobile devices in remote monitoring of
      heart failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common cardiovascular problem which is increasing in both prevalence and
      incidence and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of heart
      failure patients is complex and has become a priority world over. Effective methods to keep
      heart failure patients out of the hospital are essential, both in the interests of the
      patient's health, as well as to reduce the burden on the health care system.

      Heart failure patients should be in a position to provide readings of their weight, blood
      pressure, fluid intake, medications and other important parameters and communicate this data
      to care providers using wireless technology. This data should be made available to medical
      personnel regularly and on a periodic basis. In this manner the health care providers can
      detect and respond to warning signs or alerts before the patient's condition worsens to
      warrant a visit to the doctor or a hospital admission with features of heart failure
      decompensation.

    <measure>Measuring resiliency and reliability of mobile technology for transmitting and retrieval of daily patient vital signs and symptoms as per discharge guideline</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators instruct patients to send the clinical data (all measured parameters plus symptoms experienced over the previous 24 hours) via the mobile device every day to the local investigator. The monitoring site maintains a log of all data transmitted and received from the patient and to the patient and, any device malfunction/technical problems, unscheduled SMS/Text messages from patient and to the patient is also to be documented in the case report form for the entire duration of study.</description>
