  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to confirm that the new technique, Model-Based Iterative
      Reconstruction (MBIR) with reduced radiation dose can deliver equivalent image quality for CT
      scans compared to current techniques (Filtered Back Projection with Adaptive Statistical
      Iterative Reconstruction (FBP with ASiR) and also to demonstrate that MBIR can improve
      general image quality characteristics at equivalent radiation dose levels.
