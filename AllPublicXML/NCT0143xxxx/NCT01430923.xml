      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Refrigeration-Free Latanoprost compared to Latanoprost
           stored at refrigeration temperature with respect to the diurnal intraocular pressure
           (IOP) change from baseline after 3 months of therapy in patients with open-angle
           glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Refrigeration-Free Latanoprost in patients
           with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension.

      Latanoprost refrigeration free formulation is developed to overcome difficulties on storing
      drugs at 2-8˚ C in consumer end and also to avoid risk during transition. This formulation
      has the best solubilizing agent cyclodextrin to increase the solubility and stability of
      latanoprost API. To find out the efficacy and safety due to this additional excipient in this
      formulation rather than the cold storage product the investigators have to perform clinical
      trial.
