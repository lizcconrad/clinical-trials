      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy given before surgery of soft tissue sarcoma decreases the size
      of the tumor mass and the presence of malignant cells in its peripheral region. NBTXR3 and
      radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells and increase the tumor shrinkage rendering
      surgery more feasible or easier and achieve better local control of the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This Phase I trial aims at evaluating the feasibility of the NBTXR3 injection in the
      tumor, safety and the adequate dose of NBTXR3 when given with radiation therapy.

      Patients will receive a single intratumor injection of NBTXR3 on day 1 and will receive
      external beam radiotherapy starting on day 2 up to completion of 5 weeks, 5 days a week of
      treatment (50Gy, 2Gy/fraction). Then, all patients will undergo surgical resection of the
      tumor 5 weeks later and will be followed for wound healing and toxicity assessment. A visit
      of end of treatment will take place approximately 3-4 weeks after surgery. Patients will be
      followed for evaluation of their disease status and adverse events every 8 weeks until the
      end of study.
