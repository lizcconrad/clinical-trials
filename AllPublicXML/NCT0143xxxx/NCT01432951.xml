    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin and its
      metabolites in native Chinese patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors or
      lymphoma. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. Treatment
      of disease is not the main purpose of the study.

      This is a Phase 1 study of enzastaurin in native Chinese patients with advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma. Patients will receive daily doses of enzastaurin for 14
      days, stop dosing for 3 days during PK sampling, and resume dosing on Day 18. Patients may be
      allowed to receive enzastaurin for approximately 2 to 4 weeks after day 18 to provide an
      opportunity for a patient's oncologist to assess the potential benefit of the patient
      continuing to receive enzastaurin in the safety extension phase. There is no planned duration
      for the extension phase; patients are allowed to continue receiving enzastaurin until disease
      progression or other reason for discontinuation as per the investigator's assessment.

             hematologic malignancies [except lymphoma] are excluded from this study.)

          -  Male and female patients with reproductive potential must use an approved
             contraceptive method, if appropriate (for example, intrauterine device, birth control
             pills, or barrier device) during and for 3 months after discontinuation of study
             treatment. Women with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)

             recovered from the acute effects of therapy

          -  If the patients have hormone-refractory prostate cancer, the study doctor will discuss

             and stabilized by the time of the laboratory evaluation on the lead-in day. If
             electrolytes have not been stabilized during this time, the patient will be
             discontinued from the study. Patients with hypercalcemia are excluded.

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy, in the judgment of the investigator, that will
             permit the patient to complete the PK phase and at least 1 cycle of the safety
             extension phase (if the patient were to participate in the safety extension phase)

        Exclusion Criteria:
