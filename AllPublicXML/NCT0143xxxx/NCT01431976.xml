  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      lamotrigine monotherapy on newly diagnosed typical absence seizure in children and
      adolescents in Japan and South Korea.

      The study period is composed the baseline, fixed escalation phase, escalation phase,
      maintenance phase, taper phase, and post study examination. During the fixed escalation
      phase, the investigational product is administered at 0.3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (Week 1 to
      2), followed by 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (Week 3 to 4). Subjects thereafter visit the clinic
      once every 1 to 2 weeks during the escalation phase to increase the dose by 0.6 mg/kg/day up
      to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (whichever was less) until patients are
      confirmed to be seizure-free by HV tests for clinical signs. After seizure free is confirmed
      by HV-clinical signs, the dose is increased by one level and HV-EEG (electroencephalography)
      test (first test) is assessed at the next visit. If seizure free is observed by HV-EEG, the
      same dose is administered. Thereafter, HV-EEG (second test) is assessed at the next visit and
      if seizure free is confirmed again, the subjects enter the 12-week maintenance phase. During
      the maintenance phase, patients visit the clinic once every 4 weeks. The dose can be adjusted
      as necessary within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (whichever was less)
      taking into account the status of seizures and the safety. The investigational product is
      administered once daily (in the evening). However, if the number of tablets is large,
      twice-daily administration (in the morning and evening) is also allowed. After the completion
      of maintenance phase, subjects who have responded to lamotrigine without tolerability issues
      are eligible to enter the extension phase of the study if clinically indicated.

    <description>EEG is a diagnostic test for epilepsy. The EEG machine records the brain's electrical activity as a series of waveforms.

             regulation. This can include a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care
             home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls within the definition above.
             The definition of a child in care does not include a child who is adopted or who has
             an appointed legal guardian.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with newly diagnosed and untreated typical absence seizure; aged 2-15 years in Japan, 2-12 years in South Korea at the time of obtaining consent; weighing at least 7 kilograms (kg); without partial seizure or generalized seizures other than typical absence; and without a history of rash associated with other treatment were enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of an Escalation Phase (EP), a 12-week (W) Maintenance Phase (MP), a &gt;=2-week Taper Phase, and post-study examination within 1-4 weeks after the last dose of lamotrigine. Participants could have entered the Extension Phase (ExP) until approval for this indication or until 24 months after the Last Subject Last Visit in the MP.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Lamotrigine</title>
          <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) was administered orally once daily from Week W1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, whichever was less (WWL), until a seizure-free (SF) status was confirmed by hyperventilation (HV)-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

        <description>HV is an activation technique used to provoke seizures. Participants were instructed to breathe through their mouths deeply and rapidly (at a rate of approximately 20-25 breaths/minute) for 4 continuous minutes while sitting using a pin-wheel and were observed for clinical signs of seizures like impairment of consciousness; staring; eye enrollment; eye blinking; chewing movements; hand movement; other automatisms; atonic, tonic, clonic components; autonomic components; or any other signs.

            <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 mg/kg/day was administered orally once daily from W1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL, until a SF status was confirmed by HV-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Seizure Free as Confirmed by HV-clinical Signs at Each Assessment Point in the Extension Phase (ExP)</title>
        <description>HV is an activation technique used to provoke seizures. Participants were instructed to breathe through their mouths deeply and rapidly (at a rate of approximately 20-25 breaths/minute) for 4 continuous minutes while sitting using a pin-wheel and were observed for clinical signs of seizures like impairment of consciousness; staring; eye enrollment; eye blinking; chewing movements; hand movement; other automatisms; atonic, tonic, clonic components; autonomic components; or any other signs. During the ExP, HV-clinical signs were assessed to confirm a status of seizure free. Only participants data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X, X in category title).</description>

            <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 mg/kg/day was administered orally once daily from W1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL, until a SF status was confirmed by HV-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>
