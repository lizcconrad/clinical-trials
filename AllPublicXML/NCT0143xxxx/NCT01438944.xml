      Evaluation to determine if auto-induction can be used as a surrogate measure of nicotine
      receptor up-regulation through an observational study using nicotine replacement therapy for
      two weeks and no intervention for two weeks.

      Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to nicotine reinforces addiction. The act of
      smoking delivers nicotine through lungs into the blood stream. As a result, during smoking
      nicotine levels peak and then when smoking stops levels progressively diminish to a base
      (trough) level. At the peak level a smoker feels rewarded, but at the trough level a smoker
      starts to experience negative withdrawal affects and a desire to smoke. Nicotine Gum and
      Inhalers mimic this smoking behaviour maintaining a peak and trough regime, but nicotine
      patches do not. Instead, nicotine patches deliver a constant base dose considered to be
      either above that of the smokers trough level or at a level where negative withdrawal effects
      are reduced.

      The question arises as to if nicotine levels delivered by a patch are constant and
      potentially above that of the baseline smokers level, does this reinforce the addiction and
      therefore contribute to the high long term relapse rate? To answer this question the
      investigators will be looking at metabolites which the body uses to breakdown nicotine and
      several other enzymes. These metabolites respond to the levels of nicotine in the blood
      stream by increasing or decreasing over time. By testing blood flow, blood and urine the
      investigators are able to gain an insight into how the body is dealing with a constant stable
      dose of nicotine rather than a peak and trough dose. In combination with the questionnaires
      the investigators will be able to determine the level of affect.
