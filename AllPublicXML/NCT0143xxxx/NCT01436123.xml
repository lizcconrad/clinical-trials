      Intensive therapy with rosuvastatin 40 mg and ApoA-I Milano reduces the total atheroma volume
      (TAV) up to 6.38 or 14.1 mm3 respectively. Our previous bench studies PLASMONICS and NANOM
      First-in-Man trial documented TAV reduction up to unprecedented 79.4 and 60.3 mm3
      respectively with high level of safety and feasibility.

      The completed randomized two arm (1:1) study (NANOM-PCI) with parallel assignment (n=62)
      assessed (NCT01436123) the safety and feasibility of the delivery technique for nanoparticles
      (NP) using micro-injection catheter (with intravascular intramural injection of allogeneous
      stem cells carrying NP after MSCT-, IVUS- and OCT-guided mapping of the vessel), and
      plasmonic photothermal therapy of atherosclerosis combined with stenting (Nano group, n=32)
      versus stenting with Xience V cage (Stenting group, n=30). The primary outcome was TAV at 12
      months.

      The mean reduction of TAV at 12 months in Nano group was -84.1 mm3 (95% CI: SD 28.3; min
      -52.4 mm3, max -99.1 mm3; p&lt;0.05) versus +12.4 mm3 in case of stenting (p&lt;0.05 between
      groups). 42/62 patients (68%) in Nano group passed the Glagov threshold of a 40% plaque
      burden with mean plaque burden (PB) 36.2% (95% CI: SD 9.3%, min 30.9%, max 44.5%). The
      increase of the minimal lumen diameter was 61.2 and 63.3% at 12 month follow up in groups
      respectively. The serial assessment of VH-IVUS showed a significant decrease at 12 months in
      the dense calcium area, fibrous and fibro-fatty tissue with fulminant necrosis due to
      thermolysis in Nano-group, whereas an increase of fibrous and fibro-fatty components in
      stenting arm. We have documented 2 vs 3 cases of the definite thrombosis and 3 vs 5 cases of
      target lesion revascularization in groups respectively. The analysis of the event-free
      survival of the ongoing clinical follow-up shows the significantly lower risk of
      cardiovascular death in Nano group if compare with conventional stenting (93.4% vs 86.7%;
      p&lt;0.05).

      Plasmonic resonance-mediated therapy using noble-metal NP associated with significant
      regression of coronary atherosclerosis. Tested delivery approach has acceptable safety and
      efficacy for atheroregression below a 40% PB.

      The investigators hypothesize that multistep approach with the use of stent in acute care
      unit, and then subsequent transcatheter micro-injection with nanoparticles can resolve
      atherosclerosis, stop and regress atherogenesis, remodulate or even rejuvenate arteries. Stem
      cells in patch can be good carriers for nanoparticles as well as high-effective metabolic
      vectors (paracrine-like regulation of alive cells and via bioactive products of cell lysis
      after detonation of nanoparticles) for the treatment of plaque on site. Gold nanoparticles
      with silica-iron oxide shells promise high-energy plasmonic photothermic burning or melting
      effect under the near-infrared laser irradiation onto the lesion. Thus the investigators
      expect complex two-side effect on the plaque with protected lumen and adventitia.

      Novel discoveries in atherogenesis, and development of nanobiotechnologies with potentials
      for the management of atherosclerosis leads us to the quest of new approaches. The
      investigators still cannot really effectively treat atherosclerosis.

      The investigators management is more symptomatic, and lipid-pool or inflammation-oriented!
      The investigators cannot manage non-organic part (mineral deposits, calcified necrotic core,
      partially collagen and fibrotic tissue) and total plaque volume Surgery and invasive
      procedures is just focused on blood flow restoration (just manipulate the form of plaque) +
      concerns of clinical and technical restrictions (incl. alien body - stent) + risk of
      restenosis or subacute 'fatal' in-stent atherothrombosis + graft survival/ occlusion +
      surgery-related complications High rate of short- and long-term complications and
      readmissions. Regression of atherosclerosis in fact is still a dream. The investigators offer
      an alternative to stenting and may be cardiac artery bypass surgery (CABG). Our approach can
      really allow to rejuvenate arteries, Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) can burn plaque,
      but stem cells and bioengineered structures promise restoration of the vessel wall.

      Our personal previous data showed that PPTT can 1.6-fold reduce a volume of plaque with most
      optimal long-term result in subsets with the use of SPCs as a delivery approach. The most
      optimal delivery systems of NPs into the plaque are the on-artery bioengineered patch and
      ferro-magnetic approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nanoparticles (NPs) are quite safe for an organism but entire kinetics is mostly unknown. The
      most dangerous approach with lowest level of efficacy and safety is a delivery of NPs with
      microbubbles. SP+ and mesenchymal SPCs have the similar efficacy as a local delivery system
      with a lot of beneficial properties such as anti-inflammative, anti-apoptotic, and
      multi-metabolic effects leading to the plaque degradation and artery rejuvenation. Thus,
      nanoburning is very challenging technique to demolish and reverse the plaque especially in
      combination with stem cell technologies promising functional restoration of the vessel wall
      and can be an alternative to stenting.

      Altering general strategy the investigators generally offer:

        1. The investigators don't need a therapy only with harvested stem cells (not so effective,
           but more provocative); the investigators have to manage host resident stem cells on site
           [local in-artery infusion] with growth factors, cytokines [or systemic potentiation, but
           risk of side effects and adverse events is high].

        2. Regular intravenous systemic therapy with modified BM (bone marrow), circulating
           progenitor, and iPS (induced pluripotent) stem cells might be beneficial for prevention
           of diseases, and rejuvenation of tissues and organs - but the system as whole will be
           compromised [the investigators can store stem cells of each individual to use for cell
           therapy or bioengineering].

        3. The best way - development of bioengineered constructions through life to transplant a
           bioartificial organ on request.

        4. Multi-step invasive treatment of atherosclerosis - (1) biodegradable stenting in ACU
           (acute care unit), or preventively, with no restenosis and no acute atherothrombosis
           risk profile, (2) regular systemic or local stem cell therapy, or with cytokines, (3)
           on-artery MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells)-related bioengineered patch with silica-gold
           iron-bearing NPs [SCs (stem cells) as carriers for NPs with transduction in hands of
           magnetic fields for local elimination of plaque, and subsequent rejuvenation of artery
           wall.

      Our new approach, challenging modern therapy of atherosclerosis include:

        1. BIODEGRADABLE STENTS - for 6-24 months period under the soft short-term antithrombotic
           therapy (resolving concerns with stenosis/ lumen + steered remodeling); no hemorrhages,
           no alien metal body, no concerns with further CABG, minimal inflammation

        2. INTRAVENOUS NON-SPECIFIC SYSTEMIC STEM CELL THERAPY - before and after stenting - launch
           repair effects in vessel + beneficial effects for ischemic or injured tissues

        3. ON-ARTERY BIOENGINEERED PATCH transplantation with NPs or MICRO-INFUSION of stem cells
           bearing NP - grown with MSCs and NPs (bovine pericardium scaffold); 3-6 weeks to grow a
           thin structure (recover cells before or during stenting), multi-effects due to migration
           of SCs + bioactive products of lysis

        4. PLASMONIC PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY - 'melting' and 'burning' effects - direct degradation +
           bioactive products of stem cells' lysis + further migration of SCs from patch

      Potential expected disadvantages of our approach: Necessity of the special precise delivery
      technique. Lost function of artery - irreparable pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammative damage -
      necessity of another clinical approach for restoration of tissue (may be with stem cells).
      Threat of acute fatal atherothrombosis due to rupture of (vulnerable) plaque - verification
      of the optimal antithrombotic therapy. Cannot treat non-organic part of plaque - necessity of
      the special therapy for mineral deposits, calcified necrotic core, fibrotic sites - solution
      using stem cells. Harm of potent detrimental adverse effects - vapor bubbling (boiling of
      cytoplasm and ECM with subsequent lysis of cells, and provocation of pro-apoptotic cascades),
      acoustic and shock waves due to plasma-generated laser-related detonation of nanoshells in
      tissue - need regenerative therapy (type of SCs, conditions and way of transplantation;
      Culturing? Sorting?). Erratic (unsteered) heating - surrounding tissue of the site of
      interest can achieve a temperature until 38-39°. But at the site of burning final temperature
      can be at about 50-180 C (cauterization/ searing/ melting effect) with consequent
      pro-fibrotic effect - need regenerative therapy and clarification of energy options.
