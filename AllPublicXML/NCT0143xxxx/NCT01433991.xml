  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study which will be conducted in two parts: a
      Phase 1b part comprising a dose escalation and an expansion cohort; and a Phase 2 part which
      will comprise two cohorts. The purpose of the Phase 1b part is to identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of E7050 and E7080 (lenvatinib) in combination in subjects with
      unresectable advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the subsequent Phase 1b expansion cohort
      and Phase 2 cohorts, additional subjects with recurrent glioblastoma or unresectable Stage
      III or Stage IV melanoma and disease progression after prior systemic treatment will be
      enrolled to confirm the MTD (expansion cohort) and to further explore the clinical activity
      of E7050 and lenvatinib.

Subjects will continue on treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
Expansion: A minimum of 6 subjects with either recurrent glioblastoma or unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma will receive E7050 in combination with lenvatinib at the recommended dose from the Dose Escalation phase. Subjects will continue on treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

             consent.

         17. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
             IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] at the Screening
             and Baseline Visit (a separate Baseline assessment is not required if a negative
             Screening pregnancy test was obtained within 72 hours before the first dose of study
             drug). Females of child-bearing potential, if not practising total abstinence or
             having a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly
             effective methods of contraception: e.g., 1) an intrauterine device (IUD) or
             intrauterine system (IUS); 2) a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cup
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) + spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral,
             injected, or implanted hormonal contraceptives throughout the entire study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Use of a double-barrier method (i.e.,
             use at the same time of a condom + occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] +
             spermicide [foam, gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of
             contraception. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are
             postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12
             consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected
             primary cause) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise
             proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to
             dosing, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month
             prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using
             hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal
             contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use
             the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation.

         18. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom +
             spermicide and their female partners, if of childbearing potential, must use a highly
             effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion Criterion #18)
             beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug, throughout the
             entire study period, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the
             male subjects are totally abstinent sexually or have undergone a successful vasectomy
             with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized
             surgically or are otherwise proven sterile (see Inclusion Criterion #18).

         19. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.
