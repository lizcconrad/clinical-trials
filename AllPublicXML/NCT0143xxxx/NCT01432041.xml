    <textblock>
      Safety in seconds is a randomized controlled trial of a computer tailored Injury Prevention
      program which was conducted in the waiting area of a level 1 pediatric trauma center. A
      computer kiosk was used to randomly assign participants to study groups, collect baseline
      data and generate tailored reports based on responses to assessment items. An intervention
      group received a personalized and stage-tailored safety report and a control group received a
      personalized, but otherwise generic report on other child health topics. Telephone follow-up
      interviews were conducted 2-4 weeks and again 4-6 months after enrollment. Home visits were
      completed for a subset (n=100) of parents who completed the 4-6 month follow-up interview.
      The study aimed to increase knowledge, self reported and observed safety behaviors.
