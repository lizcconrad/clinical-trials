  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One tolvaptan 15 mg tablet or placebo tablet will be orally administered once daily in the
      morning for up to 14 days to heart failure patients with volume overload that does not show
      adequate response to other diuretics such as loop diuretics in order to investigate the
      effect of tolvaptan on the mid- to long-term prognosis of the target population. The efficacy
      of tolvaptan during the treatment period will also be investigated.
