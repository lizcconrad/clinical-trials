      This study is prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods. The volunteers received, in each period, the
      reference or the test formulation, according to the randomization list, under fasting
      conditions, in order to evaluate if the reference and test formulations are bioequivalent.

      This study is prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 seuqences and 02 periods. The objective is to confirm if two formulations of
      topiramate 100 mg, coated tablet, are bioequivalent, after oral, single-dose administration
      under fasting conditions. The test product is topiramate 100 mg produced by Dr. Reddy's
      Laboratories Ltd. and the reference product is Topamax® marketed by Janssen-Cilag
      Farmacêutica Ltda. Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers were evaluated. The volunteers
      received, in each period, the test or the reference formulation, according to the
      randomization list. In each period, blood samples are collected in the following times: 00:00
      (prior to the administration of medication); 00:20; 00:40; 01:00; 01:30; 02:00; 02:30; 03:00;
      03:30; 04:00; 05:00; 06:00; 08:00; 12:00; 16:00; 20:00; 24:00; 48:00; 72:00; 96:00; 120:00;
      144:00; 168:00; 192:00. The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated
      based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data
      of drug concentrations in blood.

    <time_frame>Collection points from time 0 to 192 hours evaluated in two periods</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time (non-compartimental method), after drug administration, defined as the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC 0-t is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to time t (the time of the last quantifiable concentration), by linear trapezoidal rule. The AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption.</description>

    <measure>Maximum observed concentration of drug through time (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collection points from time 0 to 192 hours evaluated in two periods</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as the maximum or &quot;peak&quot; concentration of a drug observed after its administration. Cmax is one of the parameters of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the total amount of drug absorbed. Measurement obtained directly of the plasma concentration curve of the drug (non-compartimental method). Occurring at Tmax.</description>

    <time_frame>Collection points from time 0 to 192 hours evaluated in two periods</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement obtained directly from the plasma concentration curve of drug against time (non-compartimental method). AUC0-inf is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) extrapolated to infinity, by formula AUC0-inf=AUClast +Clast/Kel, where Clast is the Last measurable concentration and Kel is the first order rate constant associated with the terminal portion of the curve.</description>
