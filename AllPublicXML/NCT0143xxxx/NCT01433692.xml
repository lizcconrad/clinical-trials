      Background: Cannabis is the most prevalent illegal drug used in France, and consequences
      arising from the step of 'casual consumers'(1-10 joints/month). Side effects of cannabis are
      now well documented: Trauma (driving after consuming cannabis), respiratory, cardiovascular
      diseases and psychiatric and social problems. The general practitioner (GP) is the health
      professional most viewed by adolescents. Brief interventions (BI) for adult alcohol use have
      been shown to be efﬁcient. Some BI have been designed to inspect adolescents and consumption
      of cannabis have been piloted, showing their feasibility, but no test has validated them.

      Aim : Does a BI conducted by general practitioners reduce consumption of canabis in 15 to 19
      years old ?

      Method:

      Two preliminary qualitative studies (with adolescents and GP), were used to analyze the
      difficulties of communication around cannabis use. The Scientific Committee has analyzed the
      results and developed a workshop around BI, adapted to adolescents cannabis users.

      CANABIC is a quantitative study to validate use of BI with cannabis users: a randomized
      controlled trial, clustered study, comparing an intervention group (IG) and a control group
      (CG). The intervention is the achievement of the IB during a specific consultation. The
      outcome is the consumption of cannabic (Number of joints / month).

      The study will be carried out in 3 french regions : Auvergne, Rhône-Alpes and
      Languedoc-Roussillon. 150 GPs wil be recruited and randomized in intervention group or
      control group (ratio 1 :1).

      Each GP will inlcude 5 adolescents (i.e. a total of 750 adolescents) - . The number of
      adolescents needed has been calculate with hypothesis of a significant difference of 30% in
      consumption of cannabis between adolescents who beneficied of BI (IG) and those who do not
      experienced BI ( CG) A pilot study has been conducted. Cannabis use by adolescents has
      decreased. Their perception of cannabis has changed: they are aware of the harmful effects of
      their consumption. This pilot study has improve many points of the protocol.

      Results:

      A decrease of 30% of consumption is expected (joints per month). Perception of cannabis by
      adolescents will be reviewed.

      Conclusions:

      To validate an IB adaptated to consultation with adolscents cannabis consumer in order to
      provide a tool for GP in their daily practice.

      General organisation of the study

        -  Recruitment of the GP: 3 months (from December 2011 to March 2012)

        -  Training of the intervention group GP during a one-day training, in March 2012, on 3
           thematic: relationship between GP and adolescent, cannabis and BI; by an expert team

        -  Inclusion period : 10 months (from April 2012 to January 2013). The included patients
           will be followed for 12 months. There are 3 follow up consultations at 3, 6 and 12
           months.

        -  First consultation used to the inclusion:

      Information to the patient and collection of the patient non opposition (without informing
      the intervention objectives in the control group).

      Evaluation of cannabis consumption, but also tobacco and alcohol consumption. Collection of
      the perception of cannabis by adolescents, and its impact on health.

      Inclusion criteriae : repetead users : 1 to 10 per month; regular users : 11 to 29 per month;
      daily users : 1 and more per day.

      In the IG : achievment of the BI with the adolescent. In each group, making appointment with
      the patient at 3 months

      • Follow up consultations : At 3, 6 and 12 months. Evaluation of cannabis consumption, but
      also tobacco and alcohol consumption. Collection of the perception of cannabis by
      adolescents, and its impact on health.
