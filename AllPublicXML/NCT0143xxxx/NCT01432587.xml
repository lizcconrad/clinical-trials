  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An ongoing trial of diflunisal has been closed for enrollment, thus, patients suitable for
      the study can no longer participate or receive treatment by diflunisal; and patients, who
      have participated in the trial can not continue their treatment. The investigators want to
      continue to monitor the effect of the drug on transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis in an open
      label observational study.

      Primary endpoint will be a composite score of the manifestations of the disease (Kumamoto
      scale) and secondary end points will be measurements of neurological impairment, heart
      involvement and nutritional status.

      Duration of treatment in this study is dependent of the results from the ongoing IND
      68092-study, which are planned to be presented 2013.
