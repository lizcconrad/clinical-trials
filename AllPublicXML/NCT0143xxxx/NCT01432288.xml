    <textblock>
      This study will measure resting state network central nervous system activity by functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during 4 separate interactions with a clinician. 1.

      Hypothesis 1. Because they are different sensory systems, there will be different patterns of
      Mirror Neuron System (MNS)and Resting State Network (RSN) Central Nervous System (CNS)
      activity for visual vs. tactile stimulation, regardless of Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM).

      Hypothesis 2. Because of unconscious, non-verbal signals, such as the practitioner's facial
      expression and respiratory rate, subjects' patterns of MNS and RSN CNS activity will differ
      for LKM+ vs. LKM- stimulation for both visual and tactile interventions.

      Hypothesis 3. Because there is greater opportunity to detect signals from two sensory systems
      than one, the differences between CNS MNS and RSN activity patterns for LKM+ and LKM- will be
      greater for combined visual + tactile than for either visual or tactile stimulation alone.

      This project builds on our previous research to build a platform for a successful NIH
      proposal to address a key gap in our understanding of the mechanism of non-verbal
      clinician-patient communication on physiology and behavior. Social neuroscience is a rapidly
      growing area of research that offers unique opportunities to better understand the mechanisms
      underlying common observations about clinician-patient interactions.The purpose of this study
      is to better understand the CNS mechanisms underlying the observed changes in self-reported
      well-being and ANS activity by evaluating resting fMRI activity under controlled conditions.
      The specific aims are to compare resting fMRI activity in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and
      resting state networks (RSN), reflected specifically in the Insula, Anterior Cingulate Cortex
      (ACC), Precuneus, Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Amygdala, Bilateral Inferior Parietal
      Cortex, Primary Motor-Visual System, and Dorsal Medulla while viewing touch with
      lovingkindness meditation lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation,
      receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation and both
      viewing and receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation.
      This is a descriptive study to generate sample size estimates for an NIH RO1 proposal.

        Participants will be healthy individuals, 18&lt; 40 years old, and can understand and respond
        to verbal directions while in an fMRI. Individuals over the age of 40 are excluded to
        provide a more homogeneous sample, to make this sample comparable to other research
        conducted at this institution and to decrease abnormalities in the outcome measures due to
        age-related changes.
