  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people develop high blood sugars following liver transplant that requires treatment with
      insulin in the hospital, even if they don't have diabetes, due to stress and use of steroid
      medications. High blood sugar levels can be treated with a hormone that the body makes called
      insulin. This study is being done to determine if maintaining normal blood sugar levels after
      transplant for as long as needed while in the hospital results in a lesser incidence of
      death, infections, transplanted liver rejection or failure or need for rehospitalization
      within 90 days after transplant.
