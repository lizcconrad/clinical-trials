  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind , placebo parallel controlled, standard
      therapy based phase III clinical trial, to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human
      neuregulin-1 on cardiac remodeling, as well as safety in patients with chronic heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly works on the cardiomyocytes and restored the
      normal structure and function of it.Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail
      have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively improved the heart function, and is tolerated in the
      effective dosage groups. The aim of this phase III trial is to further confirm in large
      population that rhRNG-1 administration can effectively improve the cardiac remodeling and is
      tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure.
