      -  This is a 2 stage exploratory study with a 3-month observational phase on the natural
           course, followed by a 12-month, open-label, non-comparative, single-arm, phase II pilot
           study on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a low-protein diet (LPD) in 8 adult
           patients with Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD).

        -  Objective of this trial is to test the effect of a normocaloric LPD to reactivate
           autophagy in BM/UCMD patients. The primary end point of the study will be the change in
           muscle biopsy of Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, at 1 year of LPD treatment when
           compared to baseline.

        -  The rationale rests on our discoveries that (i) mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by
           inappropriate opening of the PTP plays a key role in collagen VI myopathies; (ii)
           defective autophagy with impaired removal of defective mitochondria amplifies the
           defect; and (iii) reactivation of autophagy with a low-protein diet or treatment with
           cyclosporine A, the mitochondrial PTP inhibitor, cured Co6a1-/- mice, hinting at a
           common target among all beneficial treatments - namely autophagy.

        -  Specific aims of this project are to (i) study the modifications of clinical,
           nutritional and laboratory parameters in a cohort of patients with BM/UCMD during a
           3-month observational period before starting the LPD treatment; (ii) assess the effect
           of a normocaloric LPD in correcting defective autophagy in muscle of patients; (iii)
           test if new non-invasive biomarkers of activation of autophagy examined in the blood are
           mirroring the effect of LPD in the muscle biopsy; (iv) assess the clinical efficacy and
           safety of the LPD with an innovative combination of complementary measures of the
           nutritional status in patients.

        -  The anticipated output is defining and validating a therapeutic nutritional approach in
           autophagy upregulation for BM/UCMD.
