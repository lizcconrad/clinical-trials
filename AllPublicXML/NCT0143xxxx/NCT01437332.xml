  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific proteins and other signaling molecules are increased and decreased following nerve
      injury. Some of these are important in producing pain or explaining why pain persists after
      traumatic nerve injuries or in disease states such as diabetes. In this study, the
      investigators hypothesize that it is possible to detect changes in specific signaling
      molecules and that these will provide insights into novel treatment strategies. The patients
      to be included are those who are undergoing the removal of tissue during surgery. The tissues
      that would otherwise be discarded will be included in the study as appropriate.
