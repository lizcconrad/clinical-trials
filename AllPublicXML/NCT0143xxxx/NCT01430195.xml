  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy of afamelanotide, when combined with
      narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light, in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo.
      Afamelanotide is expected to speed up the repigmentation induced by NB-UVB light, leading to
      reducing frequency and doses of NB-UVB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder. Interventions in the treatment of
      vitiligo include phototherapy with narrow-band (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (NB-UVB).
      Further therapeutic approaches are desired and currently being evaluated. The investigational
      product, afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (alpha-MSH). The earliest described function of alpha-MSH is its ability to stimulate
      melanin synthesis in the skin and therefore stimulate pigmentation.
