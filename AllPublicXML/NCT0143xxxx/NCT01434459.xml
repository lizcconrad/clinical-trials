  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therasphere is a form of treatment that has been designed to selectively deliver radiation to
      the cancer within the patient's liver. This form of treatment has been used in a number of
      clinical trials and has been approved for use in the treatment of liver cancer.

      The investigators want to test the safety of using Gemcitabine (a chemotherapy drug) with
      TheraSphere (radioactive beads that are injected directly into the blood vessel supplying the
      tumor in the liver) in patients with advanced pancreatobiliary tumors such as pancreatic
      cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct tumors) involving the liver.

      Patients with liver predominant cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer will be considered
      for the trial. The patients wre being treated in groups of thre patients. Each three patients
      receive a pre-specified dose of gemcitabine with full dose radioembolization using
      theraspheres. If no significant side effects are observed then three additional three
      patients will be treated with a higher dose of gemcitabine. The purpose to identify the
      highest dose of gemcitabine that can be safely combined with theraspheres.

    <description>Patients will receive full dose therasphere. The gemcitabine dose will start out low and the dose will increase after first 3 patients if no significant side effects are observed. The investigators will continue to increase the dose of gemcitabine as long as the investigators do not observe side effects or until we reach full dose of gemcitabine.</description>
