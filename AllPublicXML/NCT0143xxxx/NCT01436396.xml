  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate whether the first CYD dengue vaccination can be
      administered concomitantly with Stamaril® yellow fever vaccine during the same day and visit,
      but at 2 different sites of administration.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response against Yellow Fever in
           flavivirus (FV)-naïve subjects at baseline receiving one dose of Stamaril vaccine
           administered concomitantly with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine compared to
           subjects receiving one dose of Stamaril vaccine concomitantly with placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the non-inferiority of yellow fever immune response 28 days post-Stamaril
           vaccination based on seroconversion rates regardless of the FV status of subjects at
           baseline.

        -  To describe the safety of Stamaril vaccine administered concomitantly with the first
           dose of CYD dengue vaccine, or Stamaril administered concomitantly with placebo.

        -  To describe the safety of CYD dengue vaccine after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine
           administered concomitantly with Stamaril vaccine or CYD vaccine administered alone.

      All participants will receive a total of 8 injections during the study. Vaccine
      immunogenicity assessments for dengue neutralizing antibodies will be performed in a
      randomized subset of participants. All participants will be followed-up for safety during the
      study and for 6 months after the last CYD dengue vaccination.
