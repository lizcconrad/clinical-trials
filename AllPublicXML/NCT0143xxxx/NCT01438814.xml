  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the combination therapy of linagliptin
      and metformin at submaximal doses in reduction of Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and
      metformin pre-specified gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects in treatment naive patients of
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
