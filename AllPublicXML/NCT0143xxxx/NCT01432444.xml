    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare retrospective hospitalization rates of schizophrenic
      patients treated with oral antipsychotics to prospective hospitalization rates of these
      patients treated with IM depot aripiprazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to antipsychotic medications remains a frequent cause of relapse among patients
      with schizophrenia, increasing hospitalization rates, hospitalization days, and
      hospitalization costs. Among hospitalized adults, schizophrenia is the fourth most commonly
      diagnosed illness and has the seventh longest mean duration of hospital stay in the US.
      Frequent relapses and hospitalization can affect quality of life in these patients.
      Long-acting injections (intramuscular depot) antipsychotic medication is a means to treatment
      adherence and increased quality of life for patients with schizophrenia.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity Score (CGI-S).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participant were rated using the CGI-S scale. To assess CGI-S, study physician were to answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Score (CGI-I) by Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of trial medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I scale. The study physician would rate the participants total improvement whether or not it was entirely due to drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participants condition at Baseline of the appropriate phase. The CGI-I during Phase B were assessed relative to the participants condition at the Phase B Baseline visit. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worse; 6 = much worse; and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study assessed hospitalization rates in adults with schizophrenia treated prospectively for 6 months with aripiprazole intramuscular depot compared with 6 month retrospective treatment with oral antipsychotics. The study comprised 3 phases: Tolerability/Cross-titration (Phase A), Open-label Aripiprazole (Phase B), Extension (Phase C).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>493 participants were enrolled, 325 of which had no history of tolerating oral aripiprazole entered Phase A, all participants completed Phase A combined with remainder of participants to enter Phase B. All outcome measures were assessed in Phase B.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Tolerability/Cross-titration Phase (Phase A)</title>
          <description>In Phase A, participants who had no history of tolerating oral aripiprazole entered a Tolerability Assessment/Cross-titration Phase in order to assess tolerability to oral aripiprazole. The recommended initial dose of oral aripiprazole in the Tolerability Assessment/Cross-titration Phase was 10 mg or 15 mg/day, depending on the participant's symptoms and the study physician's judgment. Participants were seen in the clinic at baseline and weekly thereafter for a minimum of 1 week and maximum of 4 weeks/28 days, until tolerability to oral aripiprazole had been determined, based on physician's discretion, or until the participant was terminated from the study.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Open-label Aripiprazole IM Depot Treatment Phase (Phase B)</title>
          <description>In Phase B, all participants received aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg and had received supplemental oral aripiprazole for the first 14 days of Phase B (open-label aripiprazole IM depot treatment phase) for more than or equal to 3 months. However, at the discretion of the study physician, the dose of aripiprazole IM depot was decreased to 300 mg only if needed for tolerability and subsequently increased the dose to 400 mg for efficacy as required. This dose adjustment was permitted as often as necessary to maintain symptomatic stability with acceptable tolerability. For purposes of this study, participants who completed Week 24 of Phase B were defined as trial completers.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P3">
          <title>Extension Phase (Phase C)</title>
          <description>Participants who completed the 24-Week treatment period (Phase B), and whom the study physician believes would receive benefit from continued treatment with aripiprazole IM depot, were eligible to enter Phase C. During Phase C, participants were to continue treatment with aripiprazole IM depot until approximately 400 subjects have enrolled in Phase B (in order to achieve approximately 200 Phase B completers).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Subscale Score.</title>
          <description>The PANSS consists of three subscales with a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicates (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 indicates (extremely severe symptoms). The symptom constructs for each subscale are as follows: 7 Positive subscale symptom constructs, 7 Negative subscale symptom constructs and 16 General Psychopathology subscale symptom constructs. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity suspiciousness/ persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>
