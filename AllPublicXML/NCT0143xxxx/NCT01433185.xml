  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to
      HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early
      diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. There is
      little information on evidence-based interventions that specifically target improved
      attendance of postpartum clinic visits and subsequent infant HIV testing in the context of
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs. The investigators propose
      a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of text messages sent to women enrolled
      in PMTCT programs on adherence to postpartum clinic visits and uptake of early infant
      diagnosis by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study seeks to test the hypotheses
      that (a) text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT will improve their attendance at the
      postnatal clinic within the first 6-8 weeks after childbirth; and (b) text messages sent to
      women enrolled in PMTCT programs will increase uptake of DNA PCR HIV testing at 6-8 weeks
      among infants exposed to HIV. This study will evaluate a novel strategy to improve adherence
      to postnatal clinic visits and increase the uptake of infant HIV testing. If proven superior
      to standard care, the proposed intervention can be easily scaled-up and integrated into
      existing healthcare systems in resource-limited settings. Findings from this study will
      provide randomized trial evidence to inform HIV prevention program planners and implementers.
      This study will also provide further information on the feasibility of using mobile
      phone-based technology for public health interventions in resource-limited settings.
