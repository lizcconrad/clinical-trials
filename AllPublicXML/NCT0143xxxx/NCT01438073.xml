  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking for subjects to complete a study on the role of kisspeptin in
      the reproductive system. Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone in humans that tells the
      body to produce other reproductive hormones. However, giving someone a continued amount of
      kisspeptin over a period of time can have the opposite effect and tell the body to, for a
      short time, stop making hormones needed for reproduction. By giving 24-hour infusions of
      kisspeptin, the investigators hope to learn more about the role kisspeptin has in the way
      bodies function normally and the role it has in conditions that affect the reproductive
      system.

      The investigators are initially seeking healthy men, healthy women with regular menstrual
      cycles, and healthy postmenopausal women. In a later part of the study, the investigators
      will also enroll subjects with reproductive disorders. Study participation involves 2
      outpatient visits and one 38-hour hospital admission when subjects will receive kisspeptin
      and Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).

      Individuals interested in learning more may call 617-724-8764.
