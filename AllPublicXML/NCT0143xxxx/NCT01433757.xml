  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the antibiotic Ampicillin is safe and tolerated
      in patients that have generalized dystonia caused by the DYT-1 gene mutation, as compared to
      patients treated with a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks and tastes the same as the
      real drug, but without the active ingredient. The second objective of this study is to
      determine if dystonia symptoms improve while on the study drug.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded and randomized drug study: neither the patient nor the investigator
      know if patients are taking study drug (Ampicillin) or placebo.

      Three study visits will include neurological exams, review of medical history, genetic test
      results and video-taped BFM-DRS motor scales. Patients will receive medication during
      baseline visit, consisting of either Ampicillin drug or placebo, which will be consumed twice
      daily for 28 days. Following a washout period (no drugs) of 7 days, patient will return to
      clinic for second study visit and receive second set of medication (placebo -vs- Ampicillin).
      Medication will be consumed twice daily for 28 days, with patient returning to clinic after a
      washout period of 7 days for final study visit in clinic.

    <description>Ampicillin will be given in capsule form. Dosage will be 2 mg daily for adults and 1 mg daily for children. One capsule will be taken each day for 28 consecutive days. After the first 28 days, there will be a 7 day 'washout' period during which no capsules are taken. Following the 'washout' period, another 28-day supply of Ampicillin will be given to the patient, to be taken in the same manner as described above.</description>
