      The aim of this retrospective single center study was to evaluate the clinical utility of
      histological and immunohistochemical analyses of specimens obtained by endoscopic
      ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).

    <description>The first, pre-op checked each diagnostic accuracy of cytology, histology, and combined analysis by EUS-FNA. and then, finaly diagnosis following surgery or clinical follow up for at least 6 months was re-check with diagnosic accuracy of cytology, histology, and combined analysis pre-diagnosed by EUS-FNA</description>
