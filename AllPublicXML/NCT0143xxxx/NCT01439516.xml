  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their
      being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to
      receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological
      incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants
      (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or
      physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or
      participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have
      financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT,
      another barrier impeding LD/LRT.

      The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic
      minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding
      LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. The investigators
      specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and
      financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their
      effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and
      their families. The investigators hypothesize: (1) Patients and families who view
      informational materials designed to promote shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT will be
      more likely than patients and families not viewing these materials to discuss LD/LRT with
      family and with health care professionals. Patients and families viewing such informational
      materials will also be more likely than those not viewing these materials to pursue and
      complete the LD/LRT process and (2) patients and their families who are offered the
      intervention to promote shared decision-making plus a financial assistance intervention for
      potential live kidney donors will be more likely than patients and families not offered both
      interventions to pursue and complete the LD/LRT process.

      The investigators will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from
      dialysis facilities in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment
      to pursue LD/LRT. Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1)
      informational intervention alone (PREPARED education), 2) informational intervention plus
      living donor financial assistance program (PREPARED plus financial assistance), and 3) no
      intervention (Usual Care). The investigators will follow participants for up to 6 months for
      progression in their commitment to LD/LRT.

    <description>Measurement of patients' pursuit of LRT will be performed using a series of questions that assess the participants' knowledge, interest, and perceived barriers to LRT. We will also ascertain use of the living donor financial assistance among potential donors and completion of evaluation and kidney transplant among both patient participants and potential living donors.</description>
