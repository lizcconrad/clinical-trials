  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A is necessary in the human diet. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and
      vegetables is not &quot;active&quot; and must be converted to the active form in the human body.
      However, information on the ability of humans to absorb and convert vitamin A to the active
      form is still lacking. In this study, the investigators will observe the absorption and
      conversion of vitamin A from orange tomato sauce and/or carrots after a meal with fat (from
      avocado fruit) and a meal without fat. The investigators will also test whether eating these
      foods might protect the blood against damage that could lead to heart disease.

      The primary objective of this study will be to demonstrate that adding avocados to a carotene
      rich meal will promote the absorption of provitamin A carotenoids and enhance the delivery of
      greater quantities of vitamin A. This objective will be accomplished by quantitation of the
      immediate post-prandial plasma concentrations of parent carotenoids and vitamin A metabolites
      after subjects consume a meal with or without avocado in combination with a serving of tomato
      sauce (containing nutritionally relevant amounts of beta-carotene) or carrots.

      The secondary objective of this study will be to determine if higher levels of carotenoids
      and other antioxidants transported in the bloodstream will have a protective role in
      promoting cardiovascular health. This objective will be accomplished by testing the oxidation
      capacity of lipoprotein fractions before and after meal supplementation.
