      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term safety of L-CsA in prevention of
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following lung transplantation (LTx) in patients
      previously enrolled in phase II/III L-CsA clinical trial 12011.201.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled extension study open only to patients who completed the Phase II/III
      core study 12011.201 and volunteered to continue or to cross-over to L-CsA inhalation
      therapy.

      Determination of long-term safety and efficacy outcome over a maximum of three years will be
      assessed.
