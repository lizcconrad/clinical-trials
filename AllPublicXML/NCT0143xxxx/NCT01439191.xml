  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is overexpressed in 20-30% of human
      breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Trastuzumab,a
      humanized anti-HER2/neu receptor monoclonal antibody, has been proved a valuable treatment
      for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has
      been shown to increase both survival and response rate, in comparison to trastuzumab alone.
      CMAB302, a biosimilar of trastuzumab, was developed by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical
      Co.Ltd. Efficacy and safety of CMAB302 as a single agent or in combination with vinorelbine
      were evaluated in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

      The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is overexpressed in 20-30% of human
      breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Trastuzumab,a

      CMAB302, a biosimilar of trastuzumab, was developed by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical
      Co.Ltd. Previous Phase I study showed that CMAB302 was well tolerated as monotherapy and the
      pharmacokinetic data exhibited a non-linear profile over the dose range of 100 to 500 mg,
      similar to that of trastuzumab. In this study, efficacy and safety of CMAB302 as a single
      agent or in combination with vinorelbine were evaluated in patients with HER2-overexpressing
      metastatic breast cancer.
