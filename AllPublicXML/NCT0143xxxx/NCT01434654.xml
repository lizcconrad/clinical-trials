  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are at risk of brain related
      complications despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Such
      complications are termed HIV neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and comprise a spectrum from
      asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
      severe HIV dementia (HAD).

      Prior to HAART approximately 30% of patients with advanced HIV disease had cognitive
      impairment; with HAART the incidence of HAND has decreased but its prevalence increased. The
      reasons for the ongoing development of cognitive impairment in HAART treated patients are not
      clear. They might relate to virus induced brain injury prior to starting HAART, the onset of
      a separate neurological process, toxicity related to HAART, or ongoing viral infection in the
      brain.

      It is clear that the ability of different antiretroviral drugs to penetrate the brain varies
      but what is not established is whether these differences between drugs lead to different
      neurological outcomes. The investigators propose to study HIV infected patients stable on
      HAART for 12 months; subdividing the groups according to the brain penetrance of their drug
      combination. Patients would undergo neuropsychological assessment and MRI brain scan at the
      start of the study and after 12 months.

      Differences in neuropsychological tests and MRI would be sought between treatment groups to
      establish whether HAART with better CNS penetration is associated with better outcome and
      fewer MRI changes.

    <measure>Change in Neurocognitive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Neuropsychological testing at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in overall neurocognitive performance, defined as a global neurocognitive z-score, after a 12-month period of observation, between HIV positive patients taking antiretroviral regimens categorized as being either of high or low CNS penetration. To derive this score, 1) raw scores obtained from a 5-domain brief neurocognitive battery were converted to age-corrected z-scores (M=0, Standard Deviation=1) and 2) the set of individual subtest z-scores were averaged to generate a single composite (global) z-score for each subject. Lower (negative) scores therefore indicate greater levels of cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in MRS Cerebral Metabolite Ratios in Basal Ganglia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in major cerebral metabolites in the basal ganglia, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), after a 12 month period of observation. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short echo time (TE). jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), in relation to internal water (H20) as standard.</description>

          <description>Full-scale IQ based on National Adult Reading Test (NART) error score. NART is a test of reading ability that has been extensively validated for use as a proxy measure of pre-morbid intellectual functioning. Full-Scale IQ score is expressed as a Standard Score with Mean=100 and Standard Deviation=15. Possible values range from 69-131. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

        <title>Change in Neurocognitive Functioning</title>
        <description>Change in overall neurocognitive performance, defined as a global neurocognitive z-score, after a 12-month period of observation, between HIV positive patients taking antiretroviral regimens categorized as being either of high or low CNS penetration. To derive this score, 1) raw scores obtained from a 5-domain brief neurocognitive battery were converted to age-corrected z-scores (M=0, Standard Deviation=1) and 2) the set of individual subtest z-scores were averaged to generate a single composite (global) z-score for each subject. Lower (negative) scores therefore indicate greater levels of cognitive impairment.</description>

        <description>Change in major cerebral metabolites in the frontal white matter, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), between baseline and 12-months. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short TE. jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), glutamate/glutamine complex (Glx), in relation to internal H20 as standard.</description>

          <population>Data presented for n=5 participants with detectable CSF ARV concentrations who had lumbar puncture at Baseline and 12 months. The pre-specified analysis was not conducted as nevirapine, raltegravir, and darunavir were the only ARVs detected in CSF, and of these, only nevirapine was detected above the minimum threshold (set at &gt;50 ug/L).</population>
