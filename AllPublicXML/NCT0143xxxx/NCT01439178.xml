      Purpose: To evaluate the acute changes in intraocular cytokines after intravitreal
      bevacizumab (IVB) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      Design: Prospective, open-label, controlled, randomized interventional clinical trial.

      Participants: Twenty eyes of 28 consecutive patients who are scheduled for pars plana
      vitrectomy (ppV) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy were prospectively enrolled.

      Methods: All patients were randomly assigned to receive IVB either at 2 or 7 days before ppV.
      Aqueous humor samples were taken from anterior chamber just before IVB and at the time of
      surgery. Multiplex cytokine array were used to assay various cytokines
