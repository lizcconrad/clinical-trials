  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the safety and efficacy of the Classic-laryngeal mask airway (c-LMA) in children has
      been shown in several large observational studies, findings suggest that the smaller-sized
      c-LMAs, in particular sizes 1 and 1½, are less suitable for airway maintenance under general
      anesthesia in small infants and that they may even be associated with more frequent
      complications than with the facemask and endotracheal tube. The pediatric i-gel is a new
      supraglottic airway device for children. It is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer with a
      noninflatable cuff. Studies about I-gel in adults have been promising, showing an easy
      insertion, high airway leak pressures, and low complication rates with few postoperative
      complaints. The aim of this study is to compare clinical performance of the pediatric i-gel
      and c-LMA in infants.
