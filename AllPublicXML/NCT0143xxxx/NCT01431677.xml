      Background:

      - In individuals as they age, changes in muscle tissue can significantly affect their muscle
      strength and exercise endurance. This process, known as sarcopenia, may lead to decreased
      mobility and physical weakness, which is what we in general refer to as frailty. The causes
      of sarcopenia and why it affects some individuals more than others are not known, but many
      factors influence muscle physiology and function, including metabolic, hormonal,
      environmental, and lifestyle factors. Researchers interested in identifying factors involved
      in the start and progression of sarcopenia need of samples of human muscle tissue and cells
      for laboratory investigations.

      Objectives:

        -  To train researchers in the appropriate procedures for performing muscle biopsies and
           collecting, labeling, and storing the samples.

        -  Develop a data base of specific scientific studies evaluating the physiological and
           metabolic function of muscle that can be used in future studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as
           well as blood and urine tests, and will schedule a date for the muscle biopsy.

        -  Participants will have a muscle biopsy, with tissue and cells taken from the upper part
           of the thigh. A local anesthetic will be given for the procedure. Participants will also
           provide a blood sample and have an electrocardiogram to evaluate heart function.

        -  Participants will have a followup visit 1 week after the biopsy visit to evaluate the
           healing process and provide any further treatment for the affected area, after which
           they may fully resume normal activities.

      An important concept in pathologic aging is that in some individuals muscle strength and
      exercise endurance are significantly decreased through both quantitative and qualitative
      changes in muscle tissue. This process, termed sarcopenia, leads to frailty, a syndrome
      characterized by decreased mobility, weakness, and a very poor prognosis for survival,
      although the causal pathway for this association is not known. The causes of sarcopenia and
      why it affects some individuals more than others is not known. This is a complicated
      scientific question because many factors influence muscle physiology and function, including
      metabolic, hormonal, environmental, life-style, co-morbid medical problems and their
      treatments, etc. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a long-standing interest in
      sarcopenia and frailty and has established a number of observational studies aimed at
      understanding the cause and course of these age-related conditions. It is our goal to try to
      identify factors involved in the initiation and progression of sarcopenia and frailty, and to
      develop therapies that can reverse or slow these processes. To identify molecular and genetic
      changes that are associated with sarcopenia, it is crucial that human muscle biopsy specimens
      be available for laboratory investigations. This proposal will enable the Clinical Research
      Branch (CRB) to set up this procedure on the NIA Clinical Research Unit located on the fifth
      floor at Harbor Hospital, and to hone the practical skills that will be needed for analyzing
      muscle tissue from individuals in observational and interventional clinical trials. The goal
      will be to become facile at performing muscle biopsies, collecting, labeling and storing the
      samples, and to ensure that all equipment and expertise required to efficiently perform the
      procedure are in place. 14 healthy volunteers will be accrued to the study, however after
      this, the protocol will be kept open for the purpose of training other physicians or nurse
      practitioners in the biopsy procedure.
