    <measure>Long-term Maintenance of Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as Measured by the Percentage of Treatment Failures in the KAPVAY vs. Placebo Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to end of the randomized-withdrawal period (26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure a ≥30 percentage increase (worsening)(ADHD-RS-IV, clinician version) total score and a ≥2 point increase (worsening) in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) at any two consecutive visits during the randomized-withdrawal period.
The ADHD-RS-IV of 2 subscales: inattention - 9 items and hyperactivity-impulsivity - 9 items. Each gives a score ranging from 0 (none, never or rarely) to 3 (severe, very often), for a total score ranging from 0 to 54 (higher score worse).
The CGI-S is a 7-point scale,1 (Normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill patients).The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) asks the clinician one question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <measure>Long-term Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD as Measured by the Change From Randomization to the End of the Randomized-withdrawal Period on the ADHD-Rating Scale-4th Edition (ADHD-RS-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to end of the randomized-withdrawal period (26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV (clinician version), has been widely used as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials of treatments in children and adolescents with ADHD. It is derived from the 18 inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive diagnostic criteria for ADHD from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). The clinician version of the ADHD-RS-IV has a large base of normative data and has demonstrated reliability and discriminant validity in children and adolescents. The ADHD-RS-IV of 2 subscales: inattention - 9 items and hyperactivity-impulsivity - 9 items. Each gives a score ranging from 0 (none, never or rarely) to 3 (severe, very often), for a total score ranging from 0 to 54 (higher score worse and a lower score more favourable). Two subscales are summed.</description>

    <measure>Long-term Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD as Measured by the Change From Randomization to the End of the Randomized-withdrawal Period on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to end of the randomized-withdrawal period (26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician rated instrument designed to assess the subject's current illness state. The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) asks the clinician one question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days.</description>

    <measure>Long-term Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD as Measured by the Change From Randomization to the End of the Randomized-withdrawal Period on the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent (WFIRS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to end of the randomized-withdrawal period (26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The WFIRS-P is designed to assess the impact of child's behavior or emotional problems on 7 domains related to function: Family (10 items), School Learning (4 items), School Behavior (6 items), Life Skills (10 items), Child's Self-concept (3 items), Social Activities (7 items), and Risky Activities (10 items). Each item was scored on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;very often&quot; or &quot;very much&quot;). Each scale score was calculated as the average for that scale. The total score is the average of all non-missing items. Higher scores are associated with greater impact of disease on functioning.</description>

    <measure>Long-term Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD as Measured by the Change From Randomization to the End of the Randomized-withdrawal Period on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children (ESS-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to end of the randomized-withdrawal period (26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the ESS-C scale from randomization to end of randomized-withdrawal period. The ESS-C is a simple eight-tem Likert scale designed to assess daytime sleepiness in children aged 2-18 years. The scale takes less than two minutes to be completed by patient or by parent rating. Sleepiness is a common symptom in both medicated and unmedicated children with ADHD given the predominance of impaired sleep quality. The total score achieved when the chance of dozing in each situation is added up serves as the outcome measure.
The ESS-C comprises 8 items describing various daytime activities. Item scores ranging from 0 (&quot;would never doze or sleep&quot;) to 3 (&quot;high chance of dozing or sleeping&quot;). A total score is derived as the sum of the items, with higher total scores indicative of a greater level of sleepiness (worse outcome). Total scores range from 0 to 24.</description>

    <measure>Long-term Safety of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD Based on the Assessment of Changes in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 20 (Week 40)</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome reported is the number of subjects that responded &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you have a wish to be dead&quot; at Visit 20.
C-SSRS is a clinician-rated instrument designed to provide consistent and systematic assessment of both suicidal ideation and behavior within a study, as well as across studies. The scale is a feasible, low burden series of questions that appropriately assess and track all suicidal events, including ideation. Suicidal ideation is assessed according to yes/no responses to 5 questions of increasing severity (from a wish to die to an active thought of killing oneself with plan and intent) as follows:
Wish to be Dead
Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts
Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act
Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan
Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent</description>

        <description>Treatment failure a ≥30 percentage increase (worsening)(ADHD-RS-IV, clinician version) total score and a ≥2 point increase (worsening) in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) at any two consecutive visits during the randomized-withdrawal period.
The ADHD-RS-IV of 2 subscales: inattention - 9 items and hyperactivity-impulsivity - 9 items. Each gives a score ranging from 0 (none, never or rarely) to 3 (severe, very often), for a total score ranging from 0 to 54 (higher score worse).
The CGI-S is a 7-point scale,1 (Normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill patients).The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) asks the clinician one question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?” which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

The CGI-S is a 7-point scale,1 (Normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill patients).The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) asks the clinician one question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?” which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV (clinician version), has been widely used as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials of treatments in children and adolescents with ADHD. It is derived from the 18 inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive diagnostic criteria for ADHD from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). The clinician version of the ADHD-RS-IV has a large base of normative data and has demonstrated reliability and discriminant validity in children and adolescents. The ADHD-RS-IV of 2 subscales: inattention - 9 items and hyperactivity-impulsivity - 9 items. Each gives a score ranging from 0 (none, never or rarely) to 3 (severe, very often), for a total score ranging from 0 to 54 (higher score worse and a lower score more favourable).

        <title>Long-term Efficacy of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD as Measured by the Change From Randomization to the End of the Randomized-withdrawal Period on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children (ESS-C)</title>
        <description>Change in the ESS-C scale from randomization to end of randomized-withdrawal period. The ESS-C is a simple eight-tem Likert scale designed to assess daytime sleepiness in children aged 2-18 years. The scale takes less than two minutes to be completed by patient or by parent rating. Sleepiness is a common symptom in both medicated and unmedicated children with ADHD given the predominance of impaired sleep quality. The total score achieved when the chance of dozing in each situation is added up serves as the outcome measure.
The ESS-C comprises 8 items describing various daytime activities. Item scores ranging from 0 (“would never doze or sleep”) to 3 (“high chance of dozing or sleeping”). A total score is derived as the sum of the items, with higher total scores indicative of a greater level of sleepiness (worse outcome). Total scores range from 0 to 24.</description>

        <title>Long-term Safety of KAPVAY in Children and Adolescents With ADHD Based on the Assessment of Changes in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The outcome reported is the number of subjects that responded &quot;Yes&quot; to the question “Do you have a wish to be dead” at Visit 20.
C-SSRS is a clinician-rated instrument designed to provide consistent and systematic assessment of both suicidal ideation and behavior within a study, as well as across studies. The scale is a feasible, low burden series of questions that appropriately assess and track all suicidal events, including ideation. Suicidal ideation is assessed according to yes/no responses to 5 questions of increasing severity (from a wish to die to an active thought of killing oneself with plan and intent) as follows:
Wish to be Dead
Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts
Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act
Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan
Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent</description>
