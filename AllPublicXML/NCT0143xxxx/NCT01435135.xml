        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have participated in RV144, received the active product, and completed all 4
             vaccination visits per protocol.

          -  Must be able to understand and complete the informed consent process.

          -  Must successfully complete a Test of Understanding prior to enrollment

               -  The volunteer must answer 80% or 8 out of 10 of the questions correctly including
                  two compulsory questions answered correctly.

               -  If the volunteer is unable to do so, he or she will be given two more
                  opportunities to repeat the TOU.

               -  If after three attempts to pass the TOU the volunteer is still unable to do so,
                  the volunteer will become ineligible for study participation.

          -  Must be in good general health without clinically significant medical history.

          -  HIV-uninfected per predefined algorithm within 45 days of enrollment.

                  acute uncomplicated dermatitis; or a short course (duration of 10 days or less,
                  or a single injection) of corticosteroid for a nonchronic condition (based on
                  investigator clinical judgment) at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this
                  study.
