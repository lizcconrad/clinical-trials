  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two stage, phase I/II, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)uninfected male and female injection drug users (IDU) aged 18 to 45. AdCh3NSmut1
      and MVA-NSMut HCV vaccine will be administered to 68 (+/-4) volunteers in stage 1. A planned
      interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity will be conducted. If no safety signal is
      detected and there is evidence of a measurable immune response to HCV then 472 (+/-4)
      volunteers will be enrolled in stage 2. Primary objectives are to 1) assess the safety of
      AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut compared to placebo when administered to HCV-uninfected IDUs and 2)
      determine if AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut HCV vaccines will reduce incidence of chronic HCV
      infection compared to placebo among HCV-uninfected IDUs. Planned study duration is approx 63
      months (accrual time, 2 months vaccination, 18 months follow-up, and 9 months extended
      observation for subjects becoming viremic in the last month of follow-up).

      A two stage, phase I/II, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)uninfected male and female injection drug users (IDU) aged 18 to 45. In this
      clinical trial AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSMut HCV vaccine will be administered intramuscularly to
      68 (+/-4) evaluable volunteers in stage 1. A planned interim analysis of safety and
      immunogenicity will be conducted based on data through 1 week after receipt of the second
      vaccination. If no safety signal is detected and there is evidence of a measurable immune
      response to HCV then an additional 472 (+/-4) volunteers will be enrolled in stage 2. The
      primary objectives of this study will be 1) to assess the safety of the new candidate
      hepatitis C virus vaccines, AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut, compared to placebo when administered
      to HCV-uninfected injection drug users (IDUs) and 2) to determine if AdCh3NSmut1 and
      MVA-NSmut HCV vaccines will reduce incidence of chronic HCV infection compared to placebo
      among HCV-uninfected IDUs. The secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of the new candidate hepatitis C virus vaccines, AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut,
      compared to placebo when administered to HCV-uninfected IDUs.The planned duration of the
      study is approximately 63 months total including accrual time for subjects (assuming 31
      months of screening/enrollments, plus 3 months of halted enrollment for the first interim
      analysis), 2 months vaccination, 18 months follow-up of each enrolled subject, and 9 months
      extended observation (monthly), from the time of infection, for subjects becoming viremic in
      the last month of follow-up.

        ability to adhere to the protocol. - Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital
        specialist supervision. - Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by a score of
        10 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) C test (a standardized
        screening tool used to identify hazardous drinkers or those with active alcohol use
        disorders, including abuse or dependence). - At high risk of HIV infection by the following
        criteria (adapted from HIV Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET) behavioral criteria for

        glucocorticoids); or high-dose inhaled steroids (high dose defined as &gt;800 mcg/day of
        beclomethasone dipropionate or equ ivalent); or any use of hepatotoxic or non-FDA approved
        medication. - Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to
        100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, within 7 days prior to the first vaccination. - Immunization
        against another pathogen within 14 days of planned injection. Second vaccination exclusion
        criteria: The following events associated with vaccine immunization constitute absolute
        contraindications to further administration of vaccine. The subject will not receive
        additional vaccination, but will continue with scheduled follow-up procedures except
        vaccination. 1. Anaphylactic reaction following administration of vaccine. 2. Pregnancy. If
        a woman reports having a positive home urine pregnancy test or a positive in clinic urine
        pregnancy test prior to a scheduled second vaccination, she is not eligible to receive the
        study vaccine. If she later returns to clinic and reports having a negative home urine
        pregnancy test and this is confirmed by a negative in clinic urine pregnancy test and a
        negative blood pregnancy test she may be eligible for the second vaccination if she is
        still within the vaccination window and no other exclusion criteria are met. The following
        adverse events constitute contraindications to administration of vaccine at that point in
        time. If any one of these adverse events occurs at the time scheduled for vaccination, the
        subject may be vaccinated at a later date (within 28 days of scheduled administration) or
        withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator. The subject will not receive additional
        vaccination, but will continue with all scheduled follow-up procedures except vaccination.
        3. Acute disease at the time of vaccination (acute disease is defined as the presence of a
        moderate or severe illness with or without fever). The vaccine dose can be administered to
        persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or
        without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., temperature of &lt;38°C (100.4°F). 4. Temperature of
        &gt;38°C (100.4°F) at the time of vaccination. 5. Immunization against another pathogen within
        14 days of vaccination
