  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cardiac abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis are already reported from the 50's, in
      studies of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Further studies have shown that these cardiac
      changes were caused not only by the myotoxic effects of alcohol, but also are present in many
      patients regardless of etiology of cirrhosis.

      These changes are characterized by abnormalities of systolic contraction in patients
      undergoing physical or pharmacological stress, changes in diastolic function and
      electrophysiological changes in a clinical condition known as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.
      Increased QT interval and the pre-ejection time changes are common in cirrhotic patients.

      To date no studies have evaluated the clinical relevance of changes in the heart of cirrhotic
      patients, or their relationship with the prognosis of affected patients. Til now, researches
      are based on strict echocardiographic parameters, not including several modern methods of
      assessment of cardiac systole and diastole. New techniques, such as two-dimensional strain,
      can bring new diagnostic and prognostic information, and it is not reported in the
      literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the morphological and functional
      cardiac changes in patients with cirrhosis and their prognostic role by evaluating new
      echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic readings.

    <description>Identify the occurrence of adverse events as defined as:
death due to liver failure, characterized by development of severe liver injury with impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy in a person who previously had well-compensated liver disease.
either upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, characterized by hematemesis (vomiting of blood or coffee-ground like material) and/or melena (black, tarry stools).
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, characterized by as an ascitic fluid infection without an evident intraabdominal surgically-treatable source.
