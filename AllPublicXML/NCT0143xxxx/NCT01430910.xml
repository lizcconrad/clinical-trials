  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised study divided into 2 parts. Part A investigates the effect of prolonged
      dosing (ten days) with Avibactam and Ceftazidime when given together and how this will effect
      how much Avibactam and Ceftazidime enters the blood. Part B investigates how much Avibactam
      (NXL104) and Ceftazidime enter the blood when Avibactam and Ceftazidine are given separately
      or together intravenously.
