    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent/assent from participant and/or participant's parent or legal
             representative.

          -  Participants with congenital hemophilia A with human factor VIII inhibitor ≤30 BU
             assessed within 90 days prior to study entry.

          -  Has previously or is currently demonstrating suboptimal hemostatic response to
             bypassing agents for treatment of bleeding episodes; suboptimal response is determined
             by the investigator , but minimally includes no or minimal evidence of response after
             at least two doses of bypassing agents, either for the current or a historic bleeding
             episode.

          -  Has an anti-OBI-1 titer ≤ 10 BU

          -  Has any serious or life-threatening bleeding episode; or requires a surgical procedure
             that could lead to a serious bleeding episode if not well controlled.

          -  Is willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits.

          -  Has no other significant hemostatic abnormality and:

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mm-cubed

               -  Prothrombin time &lt; 15 seconds

               -  INR &lt; 1.3

          -  Participants taking anti-thrombotics (such as clopidogrel, heparin or heparin
             analogue) may be included provided three half-lives of the agent have elapsed since
             the last dose of the agent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemodynamically unstable after blood transfusion, fluid resuscitation and
             pharmacologic or volume replacement pressor therapy. This hemodynamic instability is
             characterized by symptomatic hypotension resulting in vital organ dysfunction, such as
             cardiac ischemia, oliguria (urine volume &lt;0.5 mL/kg in the previous six hours),
             central nervous system hypoperfusion manifested by mental status change such as
             confusion (unless head injury or intracranial hemorrhage is present), pulmonary
             compromise, and/or acidosis (manifested by pH and lactate levels).

          -  Bleeding episode assessed likely to resolve on its own if left untreated.

          -  Use of hemophilia medication: recombinant factor VIIa within 3 hours prior to OBI-1
             administration or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) treatment within 6
             hours prior to OBI-1 administration

          -  Prior history of bleeding disorder other than congenital hemophilia A

          -  Known major sensitivity (anaphylactoid reactions) to porcine or hamster products.
             Examples include therapeutics of porcine origin (e.g. previously marketed porcine
             factor VIII, Hyate-C®) and recombinant therapeutics prepared from hamster cells (e.g.
             Humira®, Advate® and Enbrel®).

          -  Received any other investigational treatment within 30 days of the first OBI-1
             treatment.

          -  Anticipated need for treatment or device during the study that may interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety or efficacy of OBI-1, or whose safety or efficacy may be
             affected by OBI-1.

          -  Is planning to father a child during the study

          -  Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the participant's safety or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objectives of
             the study.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the study design, protocol requirements, or
             the follow-up procedures.

      <restrictive_agreement>Baxter's agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until the earlier of the primary multicenter publication or 12 months after study completion. Baxter requires a review of results communications (e.g., for confidential information) ≥30 days prior to submission or communication. Baxter may request an additional delay of ≤30 days(e.g., for intellectual property protection)</restrictive_agreement>
