  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the
      developed world. Despite available treatment, 25% of children in San Diego County
      appropriately treated for KD develop coronary artery abnormalities that could lead to
      complications later in life, including heart attack. Although investigators can identify
      children with KD that have these coronary artery abnormalities, there is no approved
      additional treatment to decrease coronary artery inflammation and arrest or prevent damage to
      the coronary arteries. Inflammation and damage to the arterial wall is central to these
      coronary artery abnormalities. Statins, a class of drugs that is known for lowering
      cholesterol, have also been shown to decrease inflammation in general as well as at the level
      of the vessel wall. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the safety of the drug
      atorvastatin in children with coronary artery abnormalities from KD.
