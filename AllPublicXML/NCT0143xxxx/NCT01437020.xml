    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infection caused by parasites carried by sand flies. The
      parasites cause fever, weight loss, and enlargement of the spleen and liver. They can also
      affect the blood and immune system. One possible treatment for VL involves an experimental
      drug called SCH708980, which may help to prevent the immune system from becoming suppressed
      and worsening the VL. Researchers want to give the drug along with AmBisome(Registered
      Trademark), which kills the parasites, to see if it is a safe and effective treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To study the safety and effectiveness of SCH708980, alone and combined with
      AmBisome(Registered Trademark), as a treatment for visceral leishmaniasis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 18 to 60 years of who have been diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis in the
           past 4 to 5 days, are HIV-negative, and are willing to stay in the hospital for 30 days.

        -  All participants will come from and be treated at the Kala-Azar Medical Research Center
           in Muzaffarpur, India.

      Design:

        -  This is a two-part study. Participants will be assigned to only one part of the study.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam; blood, urine,
           and stool samples, spleen or bone marrow samples; spleen measurements; a chest xray; and
           a heart function test.

        -  Part 1 participants will be separated into two groups: a larger group will have a
           selected dose of the study drug followed by AmBisome 7 days later, and a smaller group
           will have a placebo treatment followed by AmBisome.

        -  Part 2 participants will have either the study drug or a placebo plus AmBisome, based on
           the test results from the Part 1 participants.

        -  All participants will be monitored in the hospital for 30 days, and will have the
           following tests:

        -  Regular blood samples

        -  Urine and stool samples (day 14)

        -  Spleen measurements (days 8, 14, 21, and 30)

        -  Spleen or bone marrow sample (day 30 only). Participants who still have VL symptoms will
           give another sample on day 45.

        -  At 6 months after the start of treatment, participants will have a follow-up visit with
           spleen measurements, blood and stool samples, and possible spleen or bone marrow samples

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis, which can
      be fatal if left untreated. The majority of VL cases are found in resource-poor regions,
      including India (Bihar), Bangladesh, Brazil, Nepal, and Sudan. VL pathogenesis has been
      linked to an overproduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, which can
      promote parasite replication and disease progression. Experimental models have shown that
      IL-10 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of VL.

      The current study has two parts. Part 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalating design to
      determine the safety and tolerability of SCH708980 used in combination with
      AmBisome(Registered Trademark). Part 2 will be a randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design. A total of 50 subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will be
      enrolled in part 1 of the study. A group of 10 subjects will be observed for 7 days prior to
      receiving AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on the 8th day, as part of the control
      group. Subsequently, 40 subjects (10 subjects/group) will receive a single intravenous (IV)
      infusion of SCH708980 (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) followed by a single IV
      infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) 7 days later. The first 2 subjects from
      each dose group to receive SCH708980 will be followed for 3 days after the drug is
      administered before treatment is initiated in the remaining 8 subjects in that group. Also,
      all individuals in each group will be followed for 7 days after AmBisome(Registered
      Trademark) is administered before the next higher dose-level group is enrolled in the study.
      Dose escalation will continue to the next dose level unless dose-limiting toxicities occur in
      &gt; 20% of subjects in any cohort.

      The dose level of SCH708980 to use in part 2 of the study will be decided 30 days after the
      start of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) treatment in the group receiving the highest dose in
      part 1. Randomization and accrual for part 2 of the study will begin at this time. The
      highest safe dose of SCH709890 (&lt; 20% of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity) will be
      administered to subjects, not to exceed 10 mg/kg. Thirty subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will
      be randomized to 1:1:1 to receive:

        1. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (3.75 mg/kg) on day 8.

        2. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (5 mg/kg) on day 8.

        3. A single dose of placebo on day 1 followed by a single IV infusion of
           AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on day 8.

      SCH709890 and placebo will be administered over 60 minutes, while AmBisome(Registered
      Trademark) will be administered over 120 minutes.
