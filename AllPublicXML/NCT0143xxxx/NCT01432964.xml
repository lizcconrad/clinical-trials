  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In craniofacial trauma, the involvement of orbital structures is noted in up to 40% of cases
      (Ellis 1985). Post-traumatic orbital deformities caused by incorrect reconstruction of
      orbital dimensions are severe complications causing enophthalmos, diplopia and visual acuity
      disturbance. To prevent such complications, immediate repair of orbital injuries with the
      restoration of normal anatomy is indicated in orbital floor fractures. With the help of
      biodegradable implants small and medium-sized defects are easily managed (Büchel 2005, Lieger
      2010). In extensive fractures however, only calvarian bone and titanium mesh considered to
      provide a sufficient support of the orbital content.

      Calvarial bone can be difficult to mould and to adapt to the form and size of the orbital
      lesion. In addition, donor site morbidity cannot be disregarded. Orbital reconstruction mesh
      on the other hand is always available and easier to apply. There are however important
      requirements for these meshes, such as biocompatibility, excellent stability, optimal
      adaptability and patient comfort. Recently, the company Medartis developed a titanium mesh
      featuring a low profile. In order to regain normal function, normal anatomy has to be
      re-established. It therefore seemed reasonable to assess an implant, which would facilitate
      orbital reconstruction without disturbing normal anatomy by its size, profile height or
      properties.

      The purpose of this study was to assess the use and accuracy of the low profile titanium mesh
      for primary internal orbital reconstruction.

      Background

      Extensive bone loss after orbital trauma requires reconstruction to preserve ocular function
      and aesthetics. The optimal material for orbital reconstruction remains controversial. Today
      a multitude of both autogenous and alloplastic materials have been used for orbital
      reconstruction, including methylmethacrylate, Teflon, silicone, Supramid, Marlex, Silastic,
      gelatin film, bioactive glas, bone and cartilage (Haug 1999). The use of alloplastic
      materials has been tempered by complications such as infection, displacement and extrusion,
      fistula and cyst formation. During the past two decades, autogenous bone grafts have become
      increasingly popular for orbital reconstruction. Unfortunately, problems with bone grafts can
      occur and include unpredictable rates of bone resorption and the risk of subsequent dystopia
      or delayed enophthalmos, donor site complication, time consumption with harvesting and
      variable graft thickness and irregularities along with difficulty in graft contouring (Park
      2001). These problems have revived interest in alloplastic alternatives, particularly in
      titanium and its alloys (Park 2001). Titanium shows a low infection rate, related in part to
      its excellent biocompatibility, which manifests as osseointegration. This circumstance is
      thought to lessen the rate of infection.

      During the past decade, different studies have examined a titanium meshes for orbital repair.
      Plates used in these studies demonstrate a minimum profile height of 0.25mm.

      Objective

      Assess the use and accuracy of the low profile titanium mesh for primary internal orbital
      reconstruction

      Methods

      Clinical assessment prior to operation by a maxillofacial surgeon with regards to bone and
      soft tissue lesions as well as concomitant injuries. An ophthalmologist then assessed eye
      lesions and quantified eye mobility (in mm), bulb positioning (Hertel's exophthalmometry, in
      mm) as well as the field of binocular vision (Goldmann perimetry, in % of the total).

      Preoperative 1mm CT-scans were obtained to analyse size and location of the defect as well as
      extend of muscle entrapment. The fractures were classified according to the scores introduced
      by Jaquiery(Jaquiery 2007).

      Follow up by at 2, 6 and 12 weeks after the operation (assessments see above), including
      postoperative CT-scan within 12 weeks. Volume analysis of CT comparing the two orbits (OsiriX
      Medical Image Software (Version 3.7.1, www.osirix-viewer.com).

    <description>Surgical revisions were performed under general anaesthesia. The orbital floor was routinely exposed via a transconjunctival incision. In patients with involvement of the medial wall, a combined transconjunctival-transcaruncular approach was used. Herniated or incarcerated tissue was then complete repositioned. Stable borders around the bony defect in the orbital floor were exposed. The aluminium template was pre-bend and controlled in situ. Type and size of mesh were chosen and adjustments performed, as needed. Following the bending of the titanium mesh according to the template, it was inserted and fixed with 1.5mm screws. Alternatively the mesh could be preformed, using a sterilized skull model to shape and contour it to a normal orbit. Finally the eye bulb mobility was controlled using fine forceps (forced duction test) and the wound closed (Vicryl 5/0 rapid; optional).</description>
