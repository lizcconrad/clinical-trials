  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care transition interventions have been successful in reducing medication-related problems
      and associated rehospitalization primarily by focusing on medication reconciliation conducted
      by trained healthcare professionals. Programs to improve the medication reconciliation
      process have largely been effective, but have limitations including the expense associated
      with recruiting, training, and retaining care transition healthcare professionals (e.g.,
      nurses and nurse practitioners) the ability to provide services within a finite geographic
      area, and the retrospective nature of the reconciliation process which usually occurs in the
      home following hospital discharge. Our short-term objective is to use Pennsylvania Department
      of Aging resources to assess the feasibility of using a telemedicine medication delivery unit
      for frail older adults that require medication assistance in their home immediately following
      an acute hospitalization. As part of this feasibility assessment, the investigators will
      assess (1) recruitment process and procedures, (2) data collection procedures, (3) resource
      utilization, (4) drop-out rates, (5) acceptability and usability of the EMMA速 telemedicine
      medication delivery unit, (6) medication adherence, and (7) medication-reconciliation errors
      during transition from hospital to home.

      Care transition interventions have been successful in reducing medication-related problems
      and associated re-hospitalization primarily by focusing on medication reconciliation
      conducted by trained healthcare professionals. Medication reconciliation is the process of
      identifying discrepancies in drug regimens prescribed in different care settings or at
      different time points within the same setting, to inform prescribing decisions and prevent
      medication-related problems, including medication errors (MEs) and adverse drug events
      (ADEs). MEs and ADEs are particularly common during and following hospitalization, when
      multiple changes to a patients' medication regimens may be accompanied by inadequate patient
      education,\ follow-up, and continuity of care with primary care physicians and case managers.
      As a result of these problems, as many as 42% of general medical patients experience an ME or
      ADE after hospital discharge, with disproportionate impacts on older adults with chronic
      medical conditions. Post-hospital ADEs can be expensive, as12% result in an emergency
      department evaluation and 5% in readmission, which is associated with a significant increase
      in healthcare resource utilization and further fragmentation in care.

      Programs to improve the medication reconciliation process have largely been effective, but
      have limitations including the expense associated with recruiting, training, and retaining
      care transition healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses and nurse practitioners), the ability
      to provide services within a finite geographic area, and the retrospective nature of the
      reconciliation process, which usually occurs in the home following hospital discharge. The
      investigators short-term objective is to use Pennsylvania Department of Aging resources to
      assess the feasibility of using a telemedicine medication delivery unit for frail older
      adults that require medication assistance in their home immediately following an acute
      hospitalization. As part of this feasibility assessment, the investigators will assess
      several methods and intervention-related components.

    <intervention_name>Computerized medication delivery unit (Electronic Medication Management Assistant (EMMA)</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient's prescriptions and refills are packaged in standard-sized blister cards and loaded into EMMA units. The EMMMA identifies each medication automatically - no patient input is required. When activated by the patient, the medications are selected from the blister cards and released into the delivery tray. The EMMA will remain in the patient's home for a period of 30-days immediately following hospitalization. After 30 days, the EMMA MDU will become available for the next eligible patient. This maximizes the number of patients that can benefit from the MDU, while addressing the transition period when medication-reconciliation problems are most common.</description>
