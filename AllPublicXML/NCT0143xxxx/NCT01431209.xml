  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in treating patients with
      diffuse large B-cell or peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned (relapsed)
      or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) after donor stem cell transplant.
      Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of subjects with relapsed diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who are relapsed or refractory to
      front-line treatment and ineligible for stem cell transplantation or have recurrent disease
      after stem cell transplantation to oral ruxolitinib (ruxolitinib phosphate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety of oral ruxolitinib in subjects with DLBCL and PTCL. II. Determine
      progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and overall response (OS) in subjects
      with DLBCL and PTCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between responses to oral ruxolitinib and alterations in gene
      expression profiling (GEP) signatures as well as biomarker immunophenotypic changes related
      to JAK2/STAT3, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR pathways.

      II. Evaluate potential effect of oral ruxolitinib exposure on JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition
      in serial tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used.

Logistic regression will be utilized to assess the effects of markers at baseline on response to therapy.</description>
