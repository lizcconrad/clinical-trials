      A 1-year prospective, randomized, investigator-masked trial comparing the confocal and
      clinical effects of treatment with unpreserved prostaglandins (tafluprost) versus preserved
      prostaglandins (latanoprost) in newly-diagnosed glaucoma patients.

      The study protocol comprises 5 visits: baseline, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12.

      At baseline a clinical evaluator will perform a complete ophthalmologic evaluation to confirm
      diagnosis. The following examinations will be done in the following sequence: anterior
      segment examination, Shirmer test, Break-up time test. Thereafter, a confocal evaluator will
      perform confocal microscopy of the central and the peripheral cornea. Finally, contact
      measurements will be done in the following order: IOP (which will be measured at 3 pm),
      pachimetry (only at baseline visit) and gonioscony (only at baseline visit). A 15 minutes
      interval will elapse between two consecutive tests.
