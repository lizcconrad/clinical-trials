  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to understand how to treat Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). The goals of
      treatment are to control the lymphoma with the least amount of side effects. In many cases,
      MCL is treated with an antibody plus chemotherapy. An antibody is a laboratory-produced
      substance created to attach to proteins on the cancer cells, eventually destroying them.
      Chemotherapy is medicine that specifically destroys cancer cells.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drugs Ofatumumab
      and Bendamustine have on this type of cancer. Patients in this study will either receive
      Ofatumumab alone, or Ofatumumab combined with Bendamustine.

    <description>The proposed study is a Simon 2 stage optimal study design investigating the activity of ofatumumab alone or in conjunction with Bendamustine for patients with MCL who are either not candidates for ASCT or aged 65 or older. The study design will allow for an estimation of the single agent response of ofatumumab in patients at low biologic risk for immediate disease progression.</description>

    <description>The proposed study is a Simon 2 stage optimal study design investigating the activity of ofatumumab alone or in conjunction with Bendamustine for patients with MCL who are either not candidates for ASCT or aged 65 or older. The combined regimen will assess the response rates of the combined chemo- immunotherapy program in patients with need for cytoreductive therapy, or high risk for disease progression. Patients with a leukemic phase only presentation of mantle cell lymphoma generally have clinically low-risk disease, regardless of mantle cell IPI calculations. Upon reciew with the principal investigator, these patients may be stratified to the immunotherapy only arm if clinically appropriate.</description>

          -  Known pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Medical illness unrelated to MCL within the prior one month that will preclude
