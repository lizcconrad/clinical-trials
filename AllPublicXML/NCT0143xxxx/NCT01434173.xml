    <textblock>
      Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent used to treat common community-acquired
      respiratory tract infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and pelvic inflammatory
      disease. In the clinical development program, moxifloxacin was associated with some hepatic
      adverse drug reactions. To evaluate further the hepatic safety profile of moxifloxacin, a
      retrospective cohort study with nested case-control analysis will be conducted to assess the
      rate of noninfectious acute liver injury among new users of moxifloxacin and of other
      antimicrobials prescribed for similar indications, including amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus
      clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, and telithromycin.

      The study will be implemented in the population included in the HealthCore Integrated
      Research Database (HIRD). Eligible patients are adults aged 18 years and older with
      continuous enrollment in the HIRD for at least 6 months before their first claim for a
      prescription for a study antimicrobial. Follow-up will start at the date of the first
      prescription until the date of the earliest of the following events: noninfectious acute
      liver injury, occurrence of an exclusion criterion, end of study period, disenrollment from
      database, or death. Patients with chronic alcoholism or cirrhosis, infectious hepatitis,
      HIV/AIDS, or pregnant women will not be included.
