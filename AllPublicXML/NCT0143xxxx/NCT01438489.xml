    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI-546 compared to
      placebo in subjects with chronic, moderately-to-severely active systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) with an inadequate response to standard of care treatment for SLE.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 intravenous (IV) treatment
      regimens in adult participants with chronic, moderately-to-severely active SLE with an
      inadequate response to SOC SLE. The investigational product (anifrolumab or placebo) will be
      administered as a fixed dose every 4 weeks (28 days) for a total of 13 doses.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index [SRI (4)] Response With Oral Corticosteroids (OCS) Tapering at Day 169</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>An SRI (4) responder defined as a participant who had 1) a reduction in baseline Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4 points; 2) no worsening of disease from baseline as measured by the Physician Global Assessment (MDGA) (worsening was defined as an increase of &gt;= 0.3 from baseline on a 0 to 3.0 visual analog scale); and 3) no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) Index 'A' organ system score and no more than one new or worsening BILAG-2004 Index 'B' organ system score. OCS tapering requires a sustained reduction of OCS from Day 85 through Day 169 [less than 10 milligram per day (mg/day) and less or equal to the dose received on Day 1]. SRI was analyzed by a logistic regression model.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Type I Interferon (IFN) Test High Participants Achieving an Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI) (4) Response With Oral Corticosteroids (OCS) Tapering at Day 169</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>Type I IFN signature in whole blood assessed by using a 4-gene diagnostic test. The blood samples collected were to be used to prospectively identify participants as IFN test-high or test-low. The results of this test were used to stratify participants. An SRI (4) Responder was defined as a participant who had 1) a reduction in baseline SLEDAI-2K disease activity score of &gt;= 4 points; 2) no worsening of disease from baseline as measured by the Physician Global Assessment (MDGA) (worsening was defined as an increase of &gt;= 0.3 from baseline on a 0 to 3.0 visual analog scale); and 3) no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) Index A organ system score and no more than one new or worsening BILAG-2004 Index B organ system score. OCS tapering requires a sustained reduction of OCS from Day 85 through Day 169 [less than 10 mg/day and less or equal to the dose received on Day 1]. SRI was analyzed by a logistic regression model.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 365</time_frame>
    <description>An SRI (4) Responder was defined as a participant who had 1) a reduction in baseline SLEDAI-2K disease activity score of &gt;= 4 points; 2) no worsening of disease from baseline as measured by the MDGA (worsening was defined as an increase of &gt;= 0.3 from baseline on a 0 to 3.0 visual analog scale); and 3) no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) Index A organ system score and no more than one new or worsening BILAG-2004 Index B organ system score. OCS tapering requires a sustained reduction of OCS from Day 281 through Day 365 (less than 10 mg/day and less or equal to the dose received on Day 1). SRI was analyzed by a logistic regression model.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) to Day 422 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly (in offspring of participant). AEs may be treatment emergent (TE) [that is, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product] or non-TE. An AESI is one of scientific and medical concern specific to understanding biologics and requires close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to sponsor.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index [SRI (4)] Response With Oral Corticosteroids (OCS) Tapering at Day 169</title>
        <description>An SRI (4) responder defined as a participant who had 1) a reduction in baseline Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4 points; 2) no worsening of disease from baseline as measured by the Physician Global Assessment (MDGA) (worsening was defined as an increase of &gt;= 0.3 from baseline on a 0 to 3.0 visual analog scale); and 3) no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) Index ‘A’ organ system score and no more than one new or worsening BILAG-2004 Index ‘B’ organ system score. OCS tapering requires a sustained reduction of OCS from Day 85 through Day 169 [less than 10 milligram per day (mg/day) and less or equal to the dose received on Day 1]. SRI was analyzed by a logistic regression model.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index [SRI (4)] Response With Oral Corticosteroids (OCS) Tapering at Day 365</title>
          <description>An SRI (4) Responder was defined as a participant who had 1) a reduction in baseline SLEDAI-2K disease activity score of &gt;= 4 points; 2) no worsening of disease from baseline as measured by the MDGA (worsening was defined as an increase of &gt;= 0.3 from baseline on a 0 to 3.0 visual analog scale); and 3) no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 (BILAG-2004) Index A organ system score and no more than one new or worsening BILAG-2004 Index B organ system score. OCS tapering requires a sustained reduction of OCS from Day 281 through Day 365 (less than 10 mg/day and less or equal to the dose received on Day 1). SRI was analyzed by a logistic regression model.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly (in offspring of participant). AEs may be treatment emergent (TE) [that is, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product] or non-TE. An AESI is one of scientific and medical concern specific to understanding biologics and requires close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to sponsor.</description>
