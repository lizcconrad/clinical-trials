  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies are at risk for bleeding in their brains, which can result in developmental
      delays or other neurological problems such as cerebral palsy. Clamping the baby's umbilical
      cord immediately after birth is standard, but delaying this procedure allows more of the
      baby's blood to move from the placenta into the baby and prevents head bleeds. However, a
      delay in clamping the umbilical cord is not usually done in very premature babies, because it
      would delay their treatment and they could get cold. Milking the umbilical cord is another
      way to give premature babies more of their own blood while avoiding a delay in treatment.
      Umbilical cord milking has been shown to improve blood pressure, decrease the need for blood
      transfusions, and increase the amount of urine made in the first few days of life.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether umbilical cord milking improves blood flow in
      premature babies, and thereby reduce the occurrence of neurological problems. The
      investigators predict that the blood flow measured by ultrasounds of the heart will be higher
      in babies who receive umbilical cord milking compared to those whose cords are clamped
      immediately. Secondly, the investigators predict that cord milking will improve blood volume,
      blood pressure, and urine output, and delay the need for blood transfusions.

      This will be the first study to look at the effect that umbilical cord milking has on
      important measures of blood flow, which can predict bleeding in the head and subsequent
      developmental problems in very premature babies.

Neurodevelopmental follow-up data including cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior composite scores from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) will be recorded when available.
