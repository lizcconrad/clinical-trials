      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MediTate Temporary
      Implantable Nitinol Device (TIND) used to alleviate symptoms of Bladder Outlet Obstruction
      (BOO) secondary to Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH).The TIND is inserted in the bladder neck
      and prostatic urethra under local anesthesia for few days and taken out some 5 days later in
      the doctors office.
