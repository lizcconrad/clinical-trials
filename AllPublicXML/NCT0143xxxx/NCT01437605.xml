      The overall purpose of this research study is to find a better way to treat melanoma.

      The goals of this study are:

        1. To measure the side effects of and find out how well patients tolerate the recMAGE-A3 +
           AS15 ASCI (MAGE-A3 ASCI) treatment with or without the Poly IC:LC

        2. To see how well the patient's immune system responds to the MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment with
           or without the Poly IC:LC

        3. To measure the rate of return of the patient's tumor after the MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment
           with or without the Poly IC:LC

        4. To measure the rate of return of the patient's tumor in two groups of patients: one
           group positive for the gene signature, and the other group not positive for the gene
           signature in their tumor after the MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment with or without the Poly
           IC:LC.

      In the first year, participants may receive up to 8 injections given in the following order:

        1. 5 ASCI injections with or without Poly IC:LC with a 3-week interval between each.

        2. 3 ASCI injections with or without Poly IC:LC with a 3-month interval between each.

           During years 2 through 3, participants may receive up to 5 ASCI injections with or
           without Poly IC:LC given in the following order:

        3. During year 2, ASCI injections with or without Poly IC:LC will be given every 3 months
           for a total of up to 3 injections.

        4. During year 3, ASCI injections with or without Poly IC:LC will continue to be given
           every 3 months for a total of up to 2 more injections.

             cutaneous or mucosal melanoma. In terms of the American Joint Committee on Cancer
             (AJCC) classification [AJCC, 2009], this means that patients with resected M1a-b-c
             (stage IV) disease may be enrolled.

             series.

          -  Men must also agree to use an adequate method of contraception.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with all the

             systemic corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agents. The use of prednisone,

             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

          -  The patient has previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except
             effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
