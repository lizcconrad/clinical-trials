    <description>Beginning on day one of the chemotherapy cycle, ET will be given orally in a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 7 consecutive days for the first cycle. If there is no Grade ≥ 2 toxicity attributable to ET after the first cycle, the dose will be escalated to 150 mg daily for 7 days in divided doses of 100 mg/50 mg for the second cycle. After the second cycle, if there is no Grade ≥ 2 toxicity attributable to ET, the dose will be escalated to 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for the third and subsequent cycles.
Treatment with ET will continue for six cycles at the maximum dose achieved or until toxicity requiring discontinuation of study chemotherapy, or the site investigator, after consulting with the A5263/AMC 066 CMC, has determined that alternative therapy is required, whichever occurs first.</description>
