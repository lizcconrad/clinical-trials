      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the worksite parenting program
      intervention will show significantly better parent-child communication than will participants
      in the no-treatment (wait-list) control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In South Africa, &gt;5 million people, including many adolescents, are living with HIV.
      Prevalence is increasing throughout South Africa, most precipitously in the Western Cape, the
      site of our proposed study. The investigators propose to pilot test a multisession
      worksite-based program to help parents learn how to take an active role in rearing sexually
      healthy youth. Our specific aims are to: (1) Culturally adapt our US-developed worksite-based
      program for parents of adolescents to the South African context; (2) Examine whether a
      worksite-based program for parents of adolescents in South Africa improves the parent-child
      relationship, including general parent-child communication and communication about sexual
      health and HIV risk-reduction, as perceived by parents and adolescents; (3) Explore program
      effects on parents' HIV testing and sexual behaviors; and (4) Explore program effects on
      theoretically important psychosocial mediators of behavior change (e.g., greater
      self-efficacy for refusing sex and using condoms, and more perceived disadvantages of
      unprotected sex). The proposed research is a unique opportunity to adapt and pilot test an
      innovative HIV prevention intervention that promotes the health of families in a culturally
      acceptable and sustainable setting.

      The research is being conducted in three phases. In Phase 1, the investigators conducted
      formative qualitative interviews with South African community members who work with
      adolescents and parents, who work on HIV prevention, and who hold relevant positions at
      worksites. The investigators used this information from key community members to culturally
      adapt the program. In Phase 2, the investigators are conducting a process evaluation of one
      intervention group of 15 parents using qualitative debriefing interviews and quantitative
      data. In Phase 3, the current phase, the investigators aim to conduct a pilot intervention to
      refine the program even further and test the evaluation methods with 60 Xhosa and
      Afrikaans-speaking parents and their 11-15-year-old adolescents (who will participate in the
      evaluation but not the program). Their outcomes will be compared to a wait-list control group
      of 60 Xhosa and Afrikaans-speaking parents and their 11-15-year-old adolescents.

    <description>Measured using the Parent-Child Communication Scale (communication on sexual and HIV topics that the intervention covers) for both parent and child participants in pre- and post-assessments. This is a measurement of the number of sex and HIV topics discussed. 16 topics were assessed, including how women get pregnant, how to use condoms to prevent pregnancy and HIV, and how to recognize sexual pressure.
For each topic, participants answered yes or no if they discussed it, and then rate between 1-16 to indicate their communication (higher scores mean better communication). The total scores is reported as the sum of the 16 items, and can range from 0-16.</description>

        <title>Number of Topics Discussed Between Parent and Child</title>
        <description>Measured using the Parent-Child Communication Scale (communication on sexual and HIV topics that the intervention covers) for both parent and child participants in pre- and post-assessments. This is a measurement of the number of sex and HIV topics discussed. 16 topics were assessed, including how women get pregnant, how to use condoms to prevent pregnancy and HIV, and how to recognize sexual pressure.
For each topic, participants answered yes or no if they discussed it, and then rate between 1-16 to indicate their communication (higher scores mean better communication). The total scores is reported as the sum of the 16 items, and can range from 0-16.</description>
