  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well SNS01-T is tolerated by relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma, B cell lymphoma or plasma cell leukemia patients when given by
      intravenous infusion at various doses.

      The main purpose is to test the safety and tolerability of SNS01-T. The first group of
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia or B cell
      lymphoma will be given a relatively low dose. If tolerated, a second group will receive a
      higher dose. If tolerated by the second group, a third and then a fourth group will receive
      higher doses. Treatment-related adverse events (side effects), changes in vital signs,
      physical examination, and laboratory values will be monitored. Patients will receive twice
      weekly infusions for 6 weeks and then will be followed monthly for 6 months. A secondary
      purpose is to explore whether SNS01-T is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma, B cell
      lymphoma and plasma cell leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. B cell lymphoma patients must have had their diagnosis confirmed histologically.
             Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients must have peripheral clonal plasma cells &gt;20% of
             peripheral WBC and &gt;2 x 109/L. Multiple myeloma and PCL patients must have been
             diagnosed by having met all three of the following IMWG criteria:

               -  Clonal bone marrow plasma cells &gt;10%

               -  Presence of serum and/or urinary M-protein or, if absent, kappa or lambda serum
                  FLC must be &gt; 10 mg/dl accompanied by an abnormal kappa to lambda ratio (&lt;0.26 or
                  &gt;1.65)

               -  Evidence of end-organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell
                  proliferative disorder, specifically, one or more of the following:

                    -  Hypercalcemia: serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/100 mL

                    -  Renal insufficiency: serum creatinine &gt;2mg/dL

          2. B cell lymphoma patients must have measurable disease defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured for response in at least two perpendicular dimensions.
             Multiple myeloma patients must have measurable disease defined by the following:

               -  Serum M-protein ≥0.5g/dL or urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours by protein

         10. Be currently receiving steroids unless equivalent to 20 mg of prednisone or less

         11. Be receiving or have received heparin therapeutically within two days before and after
