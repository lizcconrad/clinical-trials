  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a devastating and costly illness. One-third to one-half of people with
      schizophrenia do not respond to the most current drugs leaving clozapine as the best
      alternative for treatment. However, over 60% of people treated with clozapine continue to
      have persistent symptoms and cognitive impairments. Little data is available to support
      evidence-based recommendations to guide clinicians in treating these patients. Preliminary
      data has suggested that adjunct treatment with minocycline may offer robust symptom
      improvement in patients with schizophrenia, including those taking clozapine. Minocycline has
      had interesting effects; including suggesting it may have a significant role in treatment of
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Minocycline is currently available generically; its
      side effects are well-described and minimal. The proposed double-blind treatment study seeks
      to demonstrate that adjunctive minocycline offers patients superior efficacy for persistent
      positive symptoms, cognitive impairments, and/or other components of schizophrenia pathology.
      This knowledge could lead to the more effective treatment of patients with schizophrenia. The
      research itself may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of positive
      symptoms and cognitive impairments, which could contribute to improved treatments in the
      future.

    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Positive Symptom Domain Scores Between Minocycline and Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline to clozapine will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy to improve positive psychotic symptoms. The 4 item positive sub factor of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) will be the primary outcome over the 10 week randomized study. Total maximum score is 28, and total minimum score is 4. The positive domain score consists of conceptual disorganization (item 4), suspiciousness (item 11) hallucinatory behavior (item 12), and unusual thought content (item 15). All data is reported as the difference between baseline and 10 weeks. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Effect of Minocycline on Cognitive Symptoms as Measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy in improving cognitive function. Neuropsychological testing will be done at baseline and endpoint using the MATRICS battery. A composite score as well as individual scores will be will be the primary outcome over the 10 week randomized study. This assessment total minimum score of -10 and maximum score of 80. He higher the score the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>The Effect of Minocycline Compared to Placebo to Improve Negative Symptoms as Measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) will be used to test changes in the total SANS score in adjunct minocycline compared to placebo in the 10 week study. This assessment has 22 items (scored 0-5) with a total minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 110. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>The total score of the Calgary Depression Rating Scale will be used to examine the efficacy of minocycline compared to placebo in improving depressive symptoms. This assessment has 9 items (scored 0-3) with a total minimum socre of 0 and maximum score of 27. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>Minocycline Dosing:
Minocycline (Dynacin® or generic) will be available in 50, 75 and 100 mg capsules. There will be matched placebo-minocycline capsules for each minocycline capsule strength. During the first week subjects will receive one 50 mg capsule twice per day (minocycline 100 mg total or matching placebo) and during weeks 2-10 subjects will receive 2- 50 mg capsules twice per day If a subject should complain of any side effect, then the blind psychiatrist will be allowed to omit the next dose of study medication and then continue the subject on the optimal treatment dose. If, despite this intervention, the subject is still unable to tolerate the 200 mg/day dose, then the dose may be lowered to 150 mg to alleviate side effects and minimize attrition.</description>

        <title>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Positive Symptom Domain Scores Between Minocycline and Placebo.</title>
        <description>Adjunct minocycline to clozapine will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy to improve positive psychotic symptoms. The 4 item positive sub factor of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) will be the primary outcome over the 10 week randomized study. Total maximum score is 28, and total minimum score is 4. The positive domain score consists of conceptual disorganization (item 4), suspiciousness (item 11) hallucinatory behavior (item 12), and unusual thought content (item 15). All data is reported as the difference between baseline and 10 weeks. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The BPRS is a scale that measures major psychotic and non psychotic symptoms in persons with psychotic disorders. It is an 4 item scale with a score range of 1-7 on each item. Results are reported as total score. Total maximum score is 28, and total minimum score is 4.</population>

During the first week subjects will receive one 50 mg capsule twice per day (minocycline 100 mg total or matching placebo) and during weeks 2-10 subjects will receive 2- 50 mg capsules twice per day If a subject should complain of any side effect, then the blind psychiatrist will be allowed to omit the next dose of study medication and then continue the subject on the optimal treatment dose. If, despite this intervention, the subject is still unable to tolerate the 200 mg/day dose, then the dose may be lowered to 150 mg to alleviate side effects and minimize attrition.</description>

        <title>The Effect of Adjunct Minocycline to Placebo on Global Clinical Improvement of Symptoms.</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression Severity score will be used to examine the effect of minocycline compared to placebo. This assessment has 2 items (scored 0-7) with a total minimum socre of 0 and maximum score of 14. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>

Minocycline (Dynacin® or generic) will be available in 50, 75 and 100 mg capsules. There will be matched placebo-minocycline capsules for each minocycline capsule strength. During the first week subjects will receive one 50 mg capsule twice per day (minocycline 100 mg total or matching placebo) and during weeks 2-10 subjects will receive 2- 50 mg capsules twice per day If a subject should complain of any side effect, then the blind psychiatrist will be allowed to omit the next dose of study medication and then continue the subject on the optimal treatment dose. If, despite this intervention, the subject is still unable to tolerate the 200 mg/day dose, then the dose may be lowered to 150 mg to alleviate side effects and minimize attrition.</description>
