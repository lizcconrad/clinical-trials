      This randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, crossover study will evaluate the abuse
      liability potential of RO4917838 in recreational drug users. In a pre-study (Part 1),
      subjects will receive a single dose of either diazepam or placebo in an inpatient crossover
      design, with a wash-out period of at least 10 days between treatments. Subjects who are
      clearly able to distinguish the positive control from placebo will be enrolled in the main
      study (Part 2) and will be randomized to single oral doses of RO4917838 (3 dose levels),
      diazepam and placebo in a double-blind, double-dummy inpatient crossover design.
      Washout-periods between the 5 treatment periods in Part 2 will be at least 10 days.
