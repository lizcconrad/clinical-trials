      OPTIMS is a non interventional validation study of the calculator developed by Bayer for
      clinician's use in the prophylactic treatment by factor VIII of patients with severe or
      moderate Haemophilia A with a severe clinical profile.

      The study takes place during a single visit, at the time of patient enrollment in the study
