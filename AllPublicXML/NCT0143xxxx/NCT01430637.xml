      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying genes in samples from younger patients with
      desmoplastic small round cell tumor registered on COG-D9902 or COG-ABTR01B1.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform whole-exome sequencing on desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) samples
           and their available matched normal samples to identify novel mutations, single
           nucleotide polymorphisms, or copy number changes associated with these tumors.

        -  To identify regions of interest that may be involved in the pathogenesis (including the
           region of EWSR1-WT1 translocation) from the whole-exome sequencing and perform detailed
           resequencing and transcriptone sequencing to further define the molecular aberrations at
           the RNA level.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for DNA sequencing, effects of RNA on gene
      expression levels, novel RNA isoforms, splice variants, and translocations.
