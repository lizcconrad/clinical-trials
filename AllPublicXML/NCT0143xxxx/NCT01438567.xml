  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary research objective is to demonstrate that subjects taking OXN PR have improvement
      in symptoms of constipation as measured by the Bowel Function Index (BFI) compared to
      subjects taking OxyPR tablets alone with cancer and non-cancer related pain without reducing
      the effectiveness of pain relief as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

      The study OXN3506 is a multicentre, multiple-dose, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy,
      active-controlled, parallel-group study in male and female subjects with non-malignant or
      malignant pain requiring opioids to assess analgesic efficacy and symptoms of constipation
      secondary to opioid treatment. Subjects will be randomised to two treatment groups and will
      be treated with OXN PR or OxyPR for up to 5 weeks. The study is composed of three phases, a
      pre-randomisation phase, a double-blind phase and an extension phase.
