      This study is investigating the effect of switching from Flolan® to Epoprostenol for
      Injection (EFI/ACT-385781A) in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients currently treated
      with Flolan®. For this purpose patients being treated for at least 12 months with Flolan®
      will be switched from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and followed-up for 90 days. During these 90
      days safety and tolerability of EFI/ACT-385781A will closely be monitored in all treated
      patients. This 90 follow-up will provide clinical evidence on the safety, tolerability,
      efficacy and treatment satisfaction of switching from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

    <description>The Borg dyspnea score was assessed at Screening or Day 1, prior to switch from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and at EOT. The Borg scale is a category-ratio scale, commonly used to evaluate the effects of exercise on dyspnea. The original and modified scales have ratio properties ranging from 0 = nothing at all to 10 = very, very severe, with descriptors from 0 to 10. Descriptors have been modified by others so that 10 has been labelled &quot;extremely severe,&quot; or &quot;the worst possible dyspnea imaginable.&quot;</description>

    <description>NYHA FC was assessed at Screening or Day 1, prior to switch from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and at EOT. Disease severity was assessed by NYHA classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension criteria: Class I: no limitation of physical activity (PA). Ordinary PA: no undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class II: slight limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class III: marked limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class IV: inability to carry out PA without symptoms. Right heart failure. Dyspnea/fatigue may even have been present at rest. Discomfort increased by any PA.</description>

        <description>NYHA FC was assessed at Screening or Day 1, prior to switch from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and at EOT. Disease severity was assessed by NYHA classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension criteria: Class I: no limitation of physical activity (PA). Ordinary PA: no undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class II: slight limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class III: marked limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class IV: inability to carry out PA without symptoms.

The TSQM-9 is a validated instrument to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, including a three question effectiveness scale. The TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>
