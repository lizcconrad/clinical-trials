  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      36 healthy adult men and women will be enrolled with the goal of having 24 subjects complete
      the entire study. The study will consist of a pre-treatment phase and a treatment phase. The
      pre-treatment phase will include screening and baseline period 1. The treatment phase
      consists of 4 treatment period: Treatment Period 1 - administration of the first E5501 oral
      dose; Treatment Period 2 - administration of verapamil and the second E5501 oral dose;
      Treatment Period 3 - administration of the third E5501 dose; Treatment Period 4 - concomitant
      administration of cyclosporine and the fourth E5501 dose. A baseline period will precede each
      treatment period. The screening period will be up to 13 days in duration. After fulfilling
      screening requirements, subjects will check into the clinic on Day -1 for baseline
      assessments. They will be domiciled in the clinical testing facility for 6 days for Treatment
      Periods 1, 3, and 4 and will return intermittently for study procedures for 8 outpatient
      visits. They will be domiciled in the clinical testing facility for at least 14 days for
      Treatment Period 2 and will return intermittently for study procedures for 7 outpatient
      visits.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception, other than estrogen-based hormonal contraceptives, during the treatment
             phase of the study

        Exclusion:

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal,
             respiratory, endocrine, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease or

             PK of the study

          -  Agents associated with thrombotic events (including oral contraceptives) must be
             discontinued within 30 days of first study drug administration
