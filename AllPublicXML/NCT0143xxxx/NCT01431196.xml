    <textblock>
      Molecular expression in breast cancer (BC) defines special fenotypes with different
      prognostic and predictive features.Since the addition of trastuzumab and lapatinib to
      chemotherapy, HER2 overexpressing tumors have become the best responders to systemic
      therapies, reaching pathologic complete response rates (pCR) around 50%. But HER2 negative
      tumors (luminal A and triple negative) are characterized by low chemosensitivity (luminal A)
      or early distant relapse after diagnosis (triple negative BC) . In this open, prospective,
      non-randomized and multicentric phase II study the investigators include stage II and III
      HER2 negative BC patients that are going to receive neoadjuvant sequential chemotherapy
      Epirubicin+Ciclofosfamide x 4 and then Docetaxel x 4)with an individualized vaccination with
      autologous dendritic cells pulsed with their own tumor. The hypothesis is that the
      reinforcement of the immune system with the autologous dendritic cell vaccination against
      HER2 negative BC could increase pathologic complete responses (pCR) and disease free
      survival(DFS), when added to chemo, surgery and radiation therapy and in a maintenance
      schedule.

      Chemotherapy schedule:

        -  dose dense epirubucin 100 mgr/m2 plus ciclofosfamide 600 mgr/m2 every two weeks for four
           cycles with with GM-CSF support on day +1 (pegylated filgastrim) or on days +5 to +9
           (filgastrim) subcutaneously

        -  docetaxel 80-100 mgr/m2 every three weeks for four cycles. Addition of GM-CSF if
           docetaxel doses are &gt; 85 mgr/m2
