  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 and
      FOLFIRI. We will utilize a sequential dose-escalation design to define the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of SOM 230 when combined with standard doses of FOLFIRI.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230, also known as
      Pasireotide long-acting release (LAR), in addition to standard therapy of FOLFIRI (5FU,
      leucovorin, and irrinotecan) can shrink or slow the growth of gastrointestinal malignancies.
      The safety of this drug in combination with standard chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) will also be
      studied. The participant's physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory
      findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Pasireotide LAR is safe and effective.

             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to administration of pasireotide. Oral,
             implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450
             interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study
