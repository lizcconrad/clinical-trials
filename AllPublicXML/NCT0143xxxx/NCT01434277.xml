      This study is to evaluate the safety of a new preservative in a lubricant eye drop used four
      times a day in healthy adults and subjects diagnosed with dry eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-site, open-labeled study. Twenty two subjects will be enrolled into the healthy adult
      group and twenty two subjects into the dry eye group. Each subject will be in the study for
      approximately 2 weeks (treatment) and seen at three study Visits: Visit 1 (Day 0, Baseline),
      Visit 2 (Day 7 +/- 1) and Visit 3 (Day 14 +/- 1). Dosing regimen is 1-2 drops into each eye,
      four times daily, for two weeks. Assessments will be comprised of visual acuity, slit lamp
      biomicroscopy, fluorescein corneal staining, and product comfort.

    <description>Product (ocular) comfort was assessed for each eye immediately, and at 1, 2, and 3 minutes following dosing at Visit 1 and 3 using a scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 is very uncomfortable and 10 is very comfortable.</description>

It measures visual acuity loss; positive values indicate vision loss, while negative values denote normal or better visual acuity.)</description>
