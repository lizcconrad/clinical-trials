  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because many women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are very sensitive to the use of
      gonadotropins, several strategies have been proposed to reduce the risk of Ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancies.

      The low dose step-up protocol and the step-down protocols in PCOS patients have been
      described in literature.

      The step-down regimen is designed to achieve the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) threshold
      through a loading dose of FSH with a subsequent stepwise reduction as soon as follicular
      development is observed on ultrasound. On the contrary the step-up regimen is based upon the
      principle of a stepwise increase in FSH supply to determine the FSH threshold for follicular
      development. After commencement of gonadotropin administration, if follicle development is
      not observed on ultrasound after 1 week, an increase in the dose is recommended. Once
      follicle growth is observed, the same FSH dose is maintained until follicular selection is
      achieved.

      Preliminary studies report that both step-up and step-down regimens achieve similar high
      rates of monofollicular development. However, the largest study published so far has shown
      that the step-up regimen is safer in terms of monofollicular development.

      Recent data demonstrate that metformin administration in infertile PCOS patients who are at
      high-risk for OHSS reduces the incidence and severity of OHSS during gonadotropin ovarian
      stimulation in a step-down regimen for in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs.

      The aim of the present study will be to compare the conventional low dose step-up protocol
      and the combined protocol consisting in metformin and gonadotropin step-down regimen.
