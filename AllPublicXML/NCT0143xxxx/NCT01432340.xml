  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an important cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI) worldwide. Seasonal
      influenza causes an estimated 250,000-500,000 deaths and 3-5 million severe illnesses each
      year (WHO, 2009), and pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza has caused morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. In Kenya, influenza accounts for up to 50% of all ARI during the peak influenza
      season, based on Kenyan Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation and KEMRI/CDC surveillance
      data. Influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce influenza-associated ARIs in developed
      countries. However, little is know about the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the
      developing world. In Kenya, a commercial trivalent injectable vaccine is licensed, but less
      than 30,000 doses are sold annually. The International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP)
      under KEMRI/CDC currently conducts population-based disease surveillance (PBDS) for severe
      acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) in two sites in Kenya, Lwak
      (Nyanza province) and Kibera (Nairobi). The investigators propose to conduct a three-year
      influenza vaccine effectiveness study using the commercially available southern hemisphere
      seasonal vaccine for 2010, which includes the pandemic 2009 H1N1 component, and for 2011 and
      2012. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing
      laboratory-confirmed influenza, non-specific ARIs at the clinic and household level, and
      secondary influenza infection and secondary ARIs. Our study hypothesis is: Immunizing
      children with influenza vaccine will decrease influenza-associated acute respiratory
      infections among children and may reduce the number of non-specific acute respiratory
      infections in vaccinated children and their household contacts.

      Vaccine will be donated by Sanofi Pasteur in a quantity large enough to vaccinate the
      eligible population. Vaccine will be made available to infants from 6 months of age through
      children up to 10 years old. This includes an age group that is at high risk for severe
      outcomes (&lt;5 years) and an age group (school-age children, 5-10) that is considered most
      likely to spread the infection.

      Ascertainment of Influenza Illness:

      Primary Outcome Measure

      â€¢ Laboratory-confirmed influenza infection

      Secondary outcome measures

        -  Medically attended ILI, SARI

        -  Community-reported ILI SARI

        -  Laboratory-confirmed influenza, medically attended ILI and SARI, and community-reported
           ILI and SARI in non-immunized household members

      In Lwak and Kibera, field workers visit households weekly and encourage residents to go to
      the free clinic if they have respiratory symptoms. Currently, from KEMRI/CDC surveillance
      data, in Kibera, approximately 57 % of people in the catchment area seek medical care for ILI
      (Range: 62% children - 52% adults) and of those people who seek care, 72% seek care at
      Tabitha clinic. In Lwak, approximately 77% of people in the catchment area seek medical care
      for ILI (Range: 75% children - 80% adults) and of those people who seek care, 34% seek care
      at Lwak clinic.

      The surveillance for ILI and SARI will continue as usual, with weekly field worker (also
      called community interviewer) household visits, clinic-based surveillance for ILI and SARI at
      Tabitha clinic and Lwak clinic, and sampling of all patients who meet the case definition for
      ILI and SARI
