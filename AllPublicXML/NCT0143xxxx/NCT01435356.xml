      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the benefit of the immunotherapeutic
      product recMAGE-A3 + AS-15 given to patients with bladder cancer after removal of the
      bladder. A course of 13 injections will be administered over 27 months.

      This study will assess an investigational treatment for patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder
      Cancer in whom the urinary bladder has been surgically removed. The investigational treatment
      aims to increase the body's immune response to a specific antigen expressed by the cancer.
      The tumour tissue will first be tested whether it expresses the MAGE-A3 antigen.

      The MAGNOLIA study is open to male and female patients with pathologically confirmed muscle
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder with expression of the antigen
      MAGE-A3 with or without limited lymph node involvement who have no evidence of disease after
      surgery confirmed with imaging procedures (scans CT/MRI).

             than the study medication within the 30 days preceding the first dose of study
             medication, or plans to receive such a drug during the study.

         11. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability

         12. The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy,
             that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk. For example, but not limited to: uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure or uncontrolled hypertension, unstable heart disease (coronary heart disease
             or myocardial infarction), uncontrolled arrhythmia or patients taking anticoagulant
             treatment or having a coagulation disorder.
