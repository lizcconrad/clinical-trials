  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project will evaluate a new mind-body intervention called Mind-Body Bridging (MBB)
      for reducing substance abuse problems in women who are undergoing a substance abuse treatment
      program. The main hypothesis is that MBB will be more effective than the control (standard)
      intervention program in helping people reduce their craving for illicit substances and/or
      alcohol.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical pilot study in which MBB will be compared with a standard
      treatment program for substance abuse. Both groups will run concurrently over the course of a
      10-week period, twice per week.

    <description>Impact of Events Scale - Revised (IES-R) is a 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales.</description>

    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (Baseline) Mid (Week 5), Post (Week 11)</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) provides an index of sleep problems and incorporates six sleep scale scores: 1) sleep disturbance, 2) sleep adequacy, 3) daytime somnolence, 4) snoring, 5) waking up short of breath with a headache, and 6) quantity of sleep. The MOS-SS is similar to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) developed at the same time, which includes more questions about sleep disturbance with seven more items overall. The 1-week assessment is adapted from the normal 4-week retrospective assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre (Baseline) Mid (Week 5), Post (Week 11)</time_frame>
    <description>Self compassion is measured by the Self-Compassion Scale that comprises 26 items. Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression).</description>

    <description>The Substance Abuse Education (SED) group will serve as the control intervention in which participants will receive instruction on a variety of topics included in the substance abuse treatment program curriculum. These will include, but are not limited to, information about anger management, smoking cessation, women's issues, and stress management, and approaches to help reduce cravings. Each week the TAU group will meet and a House of Hope (HOH) clinical staff member will discuss the above and related issues and how these may help individuals deal with their substance abuse and related psychological issues.</description>

A workbook will be incorporated into the curriculum to provide MBB participants with daily exercises and activities to help facilitate adherence to the MBB program.</description>
