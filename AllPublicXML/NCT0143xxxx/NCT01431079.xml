  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to (1) identify predictors of Human papillomavirus (HPV)
      vaccine acceptability among college men based on the Health Belief Model through focus
      groups, (2) triangulate focus group results with a prior quantitative study in developing an
      intervention based on the Health Belief Model to enhance HPV vaccine acceptability, and (3)
      test the efficacy of the above intervention based on the Health Belief Model by comparing it
      to a knowledge-based intervention. Approximately five focus groups with ten participants in
      each group with college students in the ages 18-25 years will be conducted at a large
      Midwestern University for the qualitative piece. Data will be analyzed for categories and
      triangulated with previous study to develop a theory based intervention. For the quantitative
      piece a randomized controlled design with 45 participants in each arm (theory based
      intervention and knowledge based intervention) will be implemented.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to this date, there was a lack of qualitative research on vaccine acceptability among men
      and theory-based interventions that promote HPV vaccination among men. A few studies have
      been conducted with parents and physicians regarding HPV vaccination with girls, and a few
      regarding women's awareness and acceptability. Results indicated increasing awareness of HPV,
      informing costs and benefits associated with the vaccine, and perceived susceptibility. Based
      on this information, it is crucial to obtain a further understanding of knowledge, awareness,
      and predictors related to HPV and its vaccination in men. Information obtained can be
      utilized in developing an intervention to increase intentions of taking the HPV vaccine.
      Refining results will lead to a standardization of an intervention that can be implemented
      across college campuses.

    <description>Before the interventions, post test after the interventions and follow-up 1 to 3 months after the interventions (health belief model based and knowledge based) participants will be asked about their intent to take the HPV vaccine on a scale of 0-4 Likert units and changes noted.
Posttest was conducted immediately after the intervention. Minimum score = 0 indicating no intent to take vaccine; Maximum score = 4 indicating strong intent to take vaccine. Scale was a single item scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Post Intervention to Follow-up (up to 3 Months) After the Interventions in Score of Perceived Susceptibility for HPV</measure>
    <time_frame>Post interventions and up to 3 months after the interventions</time_frame>
    <description>Before the interventions, after the interventions and up to 3 months following the interventions the health belief model construct of perceived susceptibility for HPV scores will be measured on a paper pencil self-report test and changes noted. Perceived susceptibility for HPV will be measured as a summative score on a three item Likert subscale with a range of 0 to 12 (0- not likely and 12-very likely). The subscale has acceptable validity and reliability.
Difference between posttest and pre-test was done. This value was then used to run the multiple regressions.</description>

    <description>Before the interventions, after the interventions and one month following the interventions the health belief model construct of Perceived benefits of HPV vaccine scores will be measured on a paper pencil self-report test and changes noted. Perceived benefits of HPV vaccine will be measured as a summative score on a four item Likert subscale with a range of 0 to 16 (0-not very likely and 16- very likely). The subscale has acceptable validity and reliability.

Perceived susceptibility for HPV will be measured as a summative score on a three item Likert subscale with a range of 0 to 12 (0- not likely and 12-very likely). The subscale has acceptable validity and reliability.

The subscale has acceptable validity and reliability.

        <title>Change From Baseline and After the Interventions to up to 3 Months Follow-up in Score of Self-efficacy for Receiving HPV Vaccine</title>
        <description>Before the interventions and after the interventions the health belief model construct of self-efficacy for receiving HPV vaccine scores will be measured on a paper pencil self-report test and changes noted. Self-efficacy for receiving HPV vaccine will be measured as a summative score on a three item Likert subscale with a range of 0 to 12 (0- not likely to 12- very likely). The subscale has acceptable validity and reliability.
The difference between post and pre-test was taken to determine a change score. This score was then used for regressions.</description>

        <population>A sample size of 90 men total (Erdfleder, Faul, &amp; Buchner, 1996) was needed for the intervention. This was calculated by G*Power based on: alpha= 0.05, power=.80, groups=2, measurements=2, effect size=.20, correlations among repeated measures-0.5, nonsphericity correction ε=1, giving us total sample of 90.</population>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Overall limitation of the trial were due to attrition at the one month follow up.
This was due to the end of school year.This meant that students were busy preparing for finals, starting co-ops/internships, moving back home, or lack of interest.</limitations_and_caveats>
