  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women in the United States.
      CVD disproportionately affects underserved populations, specifically low-income, minority,
      and rural women who have higher obesity rates and experience other health disparities. There
      is a need for replicable, evidence-based programs that target women, particularly midlife and
      older women who represent an increasing proportion of the U.S. population, to reduce their
      CVD risk . StrongWomen - Healthy Hearts is a 12-week, community-based program that has
      demonstrated effectiveness at improving CVD risk factors, including body weight, diet
      quality, and physical activity in a controlled, randomized trial conducted with midlife and
      older overweight and obese subjects in Arkansas and Kansas.

      The central objective is to rigorously evaluate dissemination of the StrongWomen - Healthy
      Hearts Program using the RE-AIM framework to achieve maximal public health impact. Expanded
      dissemination will occur through the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension
      Service (CSREES) This partnership will leverage a long and successful collaboration between
      Tufts University and CSREES that provides strength training programs to older women in 41
      states.
