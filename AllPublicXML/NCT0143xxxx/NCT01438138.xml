      RATIONALE: A screening test, such as My Profile Pediatric Assay, may help doctors predict a
      patient's risk of relapse and plan better treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying using the My Profile Pediatric Assay to see how well
      it works in predicting risk of relapse in bone marrow cell samples from younger patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To validate the accuracy of the My Profile Pediatric Assay to predict risk of relapse in
           pediatric patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who responded to
           cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To validate the continuous score from the pre-specified classifier as a predictor of
           relapse after response to induction chemotherapy, while controlling for the simultaneous
           effects of the following clinical and laboratory variables: age, WBC, ethnicity,
           cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD, NPM1, MRD, and bone marrow (BM) donor availability.

        -  To validate the accuracy of the prespecified low versus high relapse indicator variable
           (I_L/H) as a predictor of relapse after induction therapy.

        -  To validate the accuracy of the prespecified I_L/H as a predictor of relapse after
           induction therapy, while controlling for the simultaneous effects of the following
           clinical and laboratory variables: MRD, age, WBC, ethnicity, cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD,
           NPM1, and BM donor availability.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow mononuclear cells are analyzed by single cell network profile
      assay, the My Profile™ AML Risk of Relapse Assay. Molecular markers analyzed include
      Flt3-ITD, NPM1, and MRA. Results are then correlated with each patient's clinical data
      including patient's age, race/ethnic background, gender, treatment received, and outcomes.

    <description>A gate-keeper strategy will be applied to control the experiment-wise type I error rate at 0.05. The null hypothesis will be tested using a likelihood ratio test that will compare the likelihood for a full (LF) and a reduced (LR) logistic regression model of relapse (early relapse vs continuous complete response), where the full model will include the covariates and the continuous score from the pre-specified classifier and the reduced model will include only the covariates.</description>
