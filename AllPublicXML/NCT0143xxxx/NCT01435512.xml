  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study funded by the Department of Defense to test a therapeutic
      intervention for male combat veterans who engage in intimate partner violence (IPV). The
      investigators hope to decrease the recurrence of relationship aggression and help veterans
      manage anger. The primary aim of the study is to test the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop, standardize, and test an intervention for combat
      veterans exposed to trauma who engage in intimate partner aggression (IPA). This
      intervention, formerly labeled PTSD-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Partner Violence
      (PFCBT), and currently called the Strength at Home, Veteran's Program, incorporates
      components of interventions for IPA and trauma and will target mechanisms implicated in the
      relationship between trauma and IPA. This project addresses a number of the research gaps in
      this area of research including: (a) the development of a novel treatment approach to improve
      functioning and well-being of affected individuals; (b) tertiary prevention (of repeated IPA)
      during re-integration; and (c) examination of the efficacy of a program providing support for
      the families and caregivers of veterans with combat history.
