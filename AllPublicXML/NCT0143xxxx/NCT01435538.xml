      Care pathways are complex interventions to support the interprofessional team in the redesign
      of their care process. This international cluster randomised trial will analyse the impact of
      the development and implementation of care pathways on the interprofessional teamwork.

      Background Although care pathways are often said to promote teamwork, high-level evidence
      that supports this statement is lacking. The objective of the European Quality of Care
      Pathway (EQCP) study is therefore to study the impact of care pathways on interprofessional
      teamwork.

      Methods/design An international post-test-only cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT),
      combined with process evaluations, will be performed in Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.
      Teams caring for Proximale Femur Fracture (PFF) patients and patients hospitalized with an
      exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) will be randomized into an
      intervention and control group. The intervention group will implement a care pathway for PFF
      or COPD containing three active components: a formative evaluation of the actual teams'
      performance, a set of evidence based key interventions and a training in pathway-development.
      The control group will provide usual care. As effect measures a set of team input, process
      and output indicators will be used. Main outcome indicator is the team process indicator
      relational coordination. Next to these, process measures will be used to evaluate the
      implementation process. In total, 132 teams agreed to participate, of which 68 were randomly
      assigned to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. Based on power analysis, a
      sample of 475 team members per arm is required. To analyze results, multilevel analysis will
      be performed.

      Discussion The EQCP-study on teamwork is the first cluster-randomized controlled trial on the
      impact of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork. Results from our study will enhance
      understanding on the active components of care pathways. Through this, preferred
      implementation strategies can be defined.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion on cluster level requires the written agreement to participate form the
             hospital management, the medical head of the division and the head nurse

          -  Next to this, they have to agree that they will not develop and implement a care
             pathway for COPD- exacerbation of PFF within the time frame of the study when
             randomized in the control group

          -  Finally, the participating hospitals need an expected volume of more than one hundred
             COPD-exacerbation or PFF patients annually.

          -  To have a comparable sample across all clusters, the following inclusion criteria on
             individual level are set:

               1. All professionals that according to the medical head of the division and head
                  nurse are member of the interprofessional team caring for COPD-exacerbation or
                  PFF patients from admission until discharge out of the acute hospital ward

               2. To be part of the interprofessional care team is further conceptualized as being
                  part of the group of clinicians and staff who have a shared clinical purpose and
                  direct care responsibilities for the respective patient group during the set time
                  period

               3. All individual participants need to be member of the team during one specific
                  week, where patients are being followed for the two other trials of the
                  EQCP-project (8). This specific week is chosen by the study coordinator and can
                  be defined as an average week, with normal staff ratios

               4. Because we want to study interprofessional teamwork, each cluster is asked to
                  minimally include the orthopedic surgeons/pneumologists, head nurse, nurses,
                  physiotherapists and social workers in their sample. Based on their own judgment,
                  the chief medical doctor, in consensus with the head nurse, can decide to include
                  other professional groups in their sample

               5. In some hospitals COPD-exacerbation or PFF patients are being admitted at
                  multiple nursing wards, e.g. due to capacity problems or other organizational
                  issues. If that is the case, then the clusters are asked to only include these
                  team members that are working on the ward where the respective patient groups are
                  being admitted most frequently.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All team members that are not working (e.g. on leave) during the chosen week

          -  All team members who are only temporarily part of the team (e.g. student nurses in
             training).
