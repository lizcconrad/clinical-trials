      Specific Aim: Compare the endothelial function, arterial stiffness and components of
      metabolic syndrome of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) survivors to healthy
      sibling controls. Plan: A cross sectional study comparing ALL survivors to sibling controls
      including measures of endothelial function and arterial stiffness obtained form a peripheral
      artery tonometry device, height, weight, waist circumference, fasting lipid, glucose and
      insulin.

        This descriptive, healthy sibling control study will utilize a convenience sample of 20
        childhood ALL survivors, recruited from the Survivorship Program at Johns Hopkins (SPJH).
        The study will be introduced to survivors/parent/guardians during routine clinic visits. If
        they are interested in participation the consent form for both the survivor and sibling
        will be reviewed and taken home to discuss with the sibling and other family members.
        Follow-up phone call and questions will be encouraged. If all parties agree to participate
        an appointment will be set up to enroll the survivor/sibling and face to face informed
        consent will be obtained.

        A second method for recruitment will include mailings (see attached) to ALL survivors
        seen/treated at Johns Hopkins. Letters will include phone and email contacts to acquire
        further information and a post card to decline further contact.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Survivor:

        Inclusion

          1. Ages 8-28 (8 is chosen as lower age limit because developmental understanding will
             allow survivor to follow instructions for procedures, 28 is chosen as upper limit to
             include age ranges seen for treatment in the pediatric program)

          2. Off therapy for at least 6 months and not more than 10 years (6 months

        Inclusion

          1. Biological sibling

          2. Ages 8-28 (when more than one sibling is available the one closest in age will be
             chosen.))

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled medical conditions that could interfere with participation or
             interpretation of results

          2. History of relapsed ALL or history of bone marrow transplantation
