  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the magnitude and duration of the reduction in pH
      (acidification) following a single dose of Acidform vaginal gel containing 3, 4, or 5 g
      compared with hydroxyethylcellulose placebo gel (4 g) or no treatment. Vaginal pH will be
      measured 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, then once daily for 7 days. In addition, the participants will
      be assessed for an exploratory endpoint to the determine effect of one dose of Acidform gel
      (3, 4 or 5 g) or placebo gel (4 g) or no treatment, on asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV).

      One hundred healthy volunteer women, 20 per each treatment arm, will be treated with either
      IVAG Acidform gel, 5 g dose (GROUP A), Acidform gel, 4 g dose (GROUP B), Acidform gel, 3 g
      dose (GROUP C), Universal Placebo Gel (UPG), 4 g (GROUP D) or no treatment (GROUP E). For
      GROUPS A, B, C and D, treatment is defined as speculum exam plus instillation of
      Investigational Product (IP) or placebo gel. For GROUP E (control), no treatment is defined
      as speculum exam and no gel instillation.

      At least 15 women in each group will be of either African American or Hispanic ethnicity.
      Routine screening tests will be performed on admission; and subjects will be assessed for BV
      via vaginal swabs obtained for grading by Amsel criteria.

      A direct vaginal pH reading will be research staff-obtained before the speculum exam, as well
      as one hour, and six hours post-treatment (Day 0). At the one hour and six hour post
      treatment time points, the direct vaginal pH readings will be taken on specimens collected
      from two different positions in the vagina, in case of incomplete distribution of the IP soon
      after administration. Both readings will be included as data points. At the six hour
      timepoint, subjects will be trained on self-collecting vaginal swabs and performing the
      vaginal pH test. At 12 hours post-treatment, subjects will perform the vaginal pH test
      themselves using self-obtained swabs, and record their results for clinician review.

      Subjects will stay overnight in the domiciliary unit, and vaginal pH and Amsel criteria will
      be measured again by research staff at 24 (+/- 2) hours post-treatment before discharge on
      Day 1. The subjects will be discharged with the appropriate pH testing supplies and diary.
      All women must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse, douching and use of any
      intravaginally applied products or devices until after their final study visit on Day 7.

      Subjects will measure their vaginal pH at 24 (+/-2) hour intervals for 5 days (Days 2-6) as
      outpatients and record the pH test results, and any change in vaginal comfort, in a provided
      diary. Subjects will also record any activities engaged in from the abstinence criteria in
      the study exclusion list, if applicable, each day. On Day 7, subjects will return to the
      clinic with their diaries, have their vaginal pH and Amsel criteria determined by the clinic
      staff, and queried as to any vaginal discomfort (vaginal comfort assessment) over the course
      of the study, as self-recorded in their diaries.

    <description>Vaginal swabs will be used to collect samples from the vagina of women dosed with Acidform, HEC placebo, or no treatment. The pH of the samples will be measured at pre-determined time points over the course of 7 days. pH data will be compared across interventions to determine an appropriate dose and dosing interval for a Phase 2 trial to determine the ability of Acidform to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis.</description>
