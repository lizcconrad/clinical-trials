      This is a retrospective and prospective designed study, included hospitals are 1:1 assigned
      into two groups: ①Interventional hospital, which will receive 3-month medical education;
      ②Non-interventional hospital, which will not receive 3-month medical education. During 1
      month before education, all the electronic records of outpatients and inpatients who visit
      the included rheumatologists will be collected and the data of test and evaluation results of
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients diagnosed according to new Assessment of Spondylo-Arthritis
      International Society (ASAS) criteria will be collected from outpatient electronic records
      and inpatients medical charts; in the 3 months after education, the same data will be
      collected and compared with the data before education, and the impact of medical education on
      physician behaviour will be analyzed. Meanwhile, the understanding and acceptance level will
      be evaluated by the questionnaire, the differences before and after education and the impact
      of education on physician cognition will be evaluated.
