      The Double Sensor examined in this trial was developed by Dräger Company and is a novel non-
      invasive device for assessing core body temperature. In a preliminary research investigators
      have conducted the Double Sensor was found promising for potential use of physiological heat
      stress early detection. This follow-up experiment was designed to validate the data during
      high and changing body core temperatures and to examine the Double Sensor performance while
      integrated into a helmet as in intended application.

      12 healthy civilian volunteers will arrive to our lab and will undergo 4 experiment days:
      Recruitment day + VO2max test, 3 random days performing experiment protocol, dressed in
      uniforms: sitting in thermoneutral condition for one hour, afterwards they will walk on a
      treadmill in 5.5 km/h and 4% incline in hot chamber (40% celsius and 40% relative humidity)
      for 1.5 hours. Once connected to rectal thermistor and to the Double Sensor attached to the
      skin surface by sticker, once same as the day before with addition of cooling system of
      Icetron Technologies Ltd. worn on the wrist, and once connected to rectal thermistor and to
      the Double Sensor integrated into a helmet.
