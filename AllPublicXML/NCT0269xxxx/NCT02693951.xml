      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficiency and safety of prophylactic use of
      antibiotics in endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive in gastric varices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is still a controversy about the application of antibiotics in the
      treatment of patients with non acute hemorrhage of esophageal varices. This study is a
      randomized controlled trial. Patients randomly enter two treatment groups:

        1. the prophylactic use of antibiotics group

           and

        2. the non-prophylactic use of antibiotics group

      Treatment allocation is by block randomization with an equal number for both groups. The
      incidence of infection after endoscopic treatment will be analyzed.
