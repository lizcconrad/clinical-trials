  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in transplant
      recipients. Current recommendations suggest a 4 week waiting period between vaccination and
      transplantation and consideration of booster immunizations if antibody response does not
      reach target levels. This four week waiting period can result in delayed transplant,
      rejection of an optimal organ, or missed opportunity to vaccinate. However, these
      recommendations are not evidence based.

      This is a prospective study to look at the immune response to varicella vaccine in children
      with chronic liver disease.

      Investigators will evaluate:

        1. the time at which VZV DNA becomes undetectable in blood and saliva by PCR after
           vaccination in children with chronic liver disease and

        2. the difference in humoral and cell mediated immune response to varicella immunization
           between children with chronic liver disease and healthy children.
