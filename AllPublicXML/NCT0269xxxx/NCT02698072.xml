    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the combination of a therapeutic exercise program and dry needling in
      the treatment of knee osteoarthritis in older adults. Half of participants will receive
      therapeutic exercise program and dry needling in combination, while the other half will
      receive the same therapeutic exercise program and sham dry needling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic exercise and dry needling each relieve pain and improve function, but they are
      different treatment tools.

      Therapeutic exercise takes a multitude of forms and results in numerous systemic and local
      effects, some of which have been investigate among people with knee osteoarthritis.
      Therapeutic exercise covers a range of targeted physical activities that directly aim to
      improve muscle strength, neuromotor control, joint range of motion and aerobic fitness. One
      of the main aims of this therapeutic approach is to improve muscle strength, given that
      weakness is common in knee osteoarthritis. Enhanced strength of the lower limb may lessen
      internal knee forces, reduce pain and improve physical function.

      Primary knee osteoarthritis provokes pain and disfunction is thought mediated by joint damage
      and changes in joint homeostasis. Recently, investigations focused in impaired neuromuscular
      system as a contribution to the above mentioned symptoms in the knee osteoarthritis syndrome
      explore the use of dry needling. Dry needling is a therapeutic approach for decreasing pain
      and improve function with high recommended evidence (grade A) effectiveness for upper-quarter
      myofascial pain, but poorly understood in knee osteoarthritis patients.

    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed using a NPRS of 11 points (from 0, no pain, to 10, maximum pain). The patient determined their subjective pain intensity of the painful knee by pointing with 1 of their fingers to mark the level of pain on the scale. .</description>

    <description>The Barthel Index is considered to be the best of the activities of daily living measurement scales. The modified scoring of the Barthel Index by Shah achieved greater sensitivity and improved reliability than the original version, without causing additional difficulty or affecting the implementation time.</description>
