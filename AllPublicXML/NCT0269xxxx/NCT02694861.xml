  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to collect real world 30-day and 1-year follow-up data for
      patients undergoing TMR with the CardioGenesis Holmium:YAG Laser System either as a sole
      therapy procedure or in conjunction with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to provide ongoing clinical data regarding the
      characteristics of the patient population undergoing TMR in community practices. Secondary
      objectives include rates of postoperative mortality and MACE at 30-days and 1-year, and
      benefit of sustained improvement in angina at 30-days and 1-year.

      The study includes two patient populations:

        -  Registry Group: Patients from selected centers who previously participated in the ANGINA
           RELIEF Registry and are eligible for a one-year, prospective follow-up;

        -  Prospective Group: Up to 100 new, prospectively enrolled TMR patients from selected
           centers.

      The study objectives are as follows:

        -  Track &quot;real world&quot; performance outcomes and physician experience using the CardioGenesis
           Laser System;

        -  Further define the disease characteristics of the population being treated;

        -  Examine transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) usage characteristics, including
           surgical procedure information, and 30-day and 1-year outcomes;

        -  Further assess the risk factors for adverse events at 30-days and 1-year;

        -  Further define MACE rates and angina scores at 30-days and 1-year. To limit the
           potential for bias, all patients eligible for TMR treatment who meet the Inclusion and
           Exclusion Criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll in the study at
           participating centers.

      Primary Endpoint:

      - 1-year Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina class

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  All-cause mortality at 30-day and 1-year.

        -  Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 30-days and 1-year, defined as
           the incidence of cardiac-related death, myocardial infarction (Q-wave and non Q-wave),
           congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and serious arrhythmia.

      The definitions for MACE events are as follows:

        -  Cardiac-related death: any death that is not clearly attributable to a non-cardiac
           cause, and includes death due to any of the following: acute myocardial infarction,
           heart failure, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia, or
           post-procedural complications (i.e., bleeding).

        -  Q-wave myocardial infarction: the appearance of new Q waves of 40 or more milliseconds
           in 2 or more contiguous leads and elevation of CK-MB.

        -  Non Q-wave myocardial infarction: the elevation of total CK more than twice normal with
           elevated CK-MB.

        -  Congestive heart failure: Symptoms of pulmonary vascular congestion or a low output
           state that is due to left ventricular failure and is new in onset or results in
           re-hospitalization.

        -  Cerebrovascular accident: Any sudden development of neurological deficits due to
           vascular lesions of the brain such as hemorrhage, embolism, or thrombosis that persists
           for &gt; 24 hours.

        -  Serious arrhythmia: Supra-ventricular or ventricular arrhythmias that require sustained
           intravenous pharmacologic treatment, temporary or permanent pacing, or immediate
           electrical cardioversion or defibrillation. Arrhythmias resulting in syncope, myocardial
           ischemia, or death are also classified as serious.

        -  Any other serious operative complications related to the procedure: example: major
           bleeding requiring transfusion.

    <description>Class I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walking and climbing stairs. Angina with strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion at work or recreation; Class II: Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, or in wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening. Walking more than two blocks on the level and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions; Class III: Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Walking one or two blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at normal pace; Class IV: Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, anginal syndrome may be present at rest.</description>
