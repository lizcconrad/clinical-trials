      Background: Ankylosing spondylitis imposes burdens on individuals and society that AS costs 3
      times higher than general population. Conventional approaches for AS have their limitation.
      Previous studies demonstrated acupuncture has significant therapeutic effects for AS in
      diminishing joint pain, enhancing functional disorders and modifying spinal deformity.
      Although acupuncture is effective in relieving pain in AS patients, the evidence is very
      limited due to methodological flaws.

      Design This study will be a single-arm pilot study in patients with AS. Eligible subjects
      will receive electroacupuncture treatment twice per week for at least 6 weeks (12 sessions in
      total). The length of treatment can be extended to a maximum of 10 weeks (20 sessions in
      total) if participants request a prolonged treatment. The acupuncturist, who is a registered
      Chinese medicine practitioner, of this trial will not participate in data collection and data
      entry.

      Objective: To explore the treatment effect of electroacupuncture for relieving pain in
      ankylosing spondylitis.

      Setting: Hong Kong

      Participants: 20 subjects with a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis

      Main Measures: Pain Severity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Adverse events

      Data analysis All data will be double-entered and checked for consistency before conducting
      the analysis. Binomial test will be used to analyze the percentage of responders to treatment
      compared with a reference value of 10%. Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to compare the
      values of all continuous variables between baseline and post treatment. The population for
      safety analyses will include all subjects who receive at least one acupuncture treatment.
      Adverse events will be coded using the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology Dictionary. Special
      attention will be given to those subjects who have discontinued treatment due to adverse
      events or who experience serious adverse events.
