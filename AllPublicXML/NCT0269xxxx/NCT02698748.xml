    <textblock>
      One of the proposed ideas for malaria elimination includes the use of drugs to interrupt
      malaria transmission by exhausting the human reservoir of infection. Theoretically, mass
      treatment of an entire population with a very effective and rapid-acting drug (for instance
      an ACT), followed by the administration of an effective prophylactic regime during a minimum
      of four weeks, so as to outlast the typical development period of Plasmodium parasites in
      Anopheline mosquitoes, could achieve the same objective. In this respect, chloroquine (CQ)
      would be an appropriate candidate. This drug exhibits two conditions that make it attractive
      for elimination campaigns: 1) It has been demonstrated to have an excellent safety profile,
      allowing for its use in all age groups including pregnant women and children; and 2) Its
      relatively long elimination half life (t1/2=1-2 months) can provide a long post-treatment
      prophylactic effect. Recent evidence suggests that CQ sensitivity may be returning in places
      where discontinuation has reduced the drug pressure to the parasite populations. In countries
      such as Malawi, P. falciparum seems to have regained full sensitivity to CQ, and molecular
      markers of antiCQ resistance have nearly disappeared. While this does not support the
      reintroduction of CQ as first line therapy, it does suggest that, if proven sensitive in a
      given area, it could play a prophylactic role in malaria elimination strategies when used in
      combination with other drugs or tools. Thus, we intend to evaluate the potential role of
      chloroquine in preventing infections during elimination campaigns by performing a randomized,
      single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic Mozambican adults.

      Choosing asymptomatic parasitaemic adult males from a malaria-endemic area as our study
      population introduces limited risks when administering a drug with an uncertain efficacy (47%
      efficacious in 2001-2002). In malaria-endemic areas, this age group has a remarkably low risk
      of developing severe disease (irrespective of clinical symptoms), and it is foreseeable that
      parasitemia may be well tolerated, and in certain cases, spontaneously cleared from the
      individual's blood as a result of the immune system. In the unlikely event of any clinical
      symptomatology appearing throughout the follow-up, individuals will be examined by a study
      clinician and treated immediately with the country's first-line malaria treatment
      (artemether-lumefantrine, Coartem ®).

      This surveillance study is a two-arm prospective evaluation of parasitological responses to
      directly observed treatment with CQ (vs. placebo) for the clearing of asymptomatic
      parasitemia. People with asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitaemia, defined as the presence of
      a P. falciparum infection in the absence of any clinical symptomatology including fever,
      history of fever in the preceding 24 hours, malaise, fatigue, chills, or any other symptoms
      that may be derived from the malarial infection, who meet the study inclusion criteria will
      be enrolled, treated on site with CQ phosphate (25mg/Kg CQ base divided in three daily doses:
      10mg/kg day 1 (usually 4 tablets); 10mg/kg day 2 (4 tablets) and 5mg/kg day 3 (2 tablets)) or
      placebo pills (same schedule, 4 tablets day one and two; and 2 tablets on day three), and
      monitored for 28 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and
      corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these
      assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or
      an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the
      follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis will
      be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence due to treatment failure and episodes of
      reinfection.
