  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal reader study is to assess the comparative accuracy of Fujifilm
      FFDM plus DBT versus FFDM alone in the detection of breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and effectiveness of FFDM + DBT are both linked to the ability of radiologists
      interpreting FFDM + DBT images to accurately diagnose breast cancer. Each study endpoint
      therefore addresses both safety and effectiveness.

    <description>The study will be considered to have successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness of the Fujifilm Aspire Cristalle: FFDM +DBT system if the per-subject average AUC for FFDM+DBT is statistically significantly superior to the average AUC for FFDM alone at the alpha = 0.05 significance level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects under protocol FMSU2013-004A, defined as female subjects with known
             true clinical status and with complete FFDM and DBT examinations, in which there is
             sufficient anatomical coverage, sufficient contrast, and no significant motion or
             other artifacts, as determined by the image-acquisition sites.

          -  Meet none of the exclusion criteria under protocol FMSU2013-004A.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are in violation of protocol FMSU2013-004A.

          -  Subjects who meet exclusion criteria under protocol FMSU2013-004A.

          -  Subjects with unknown clinical status.

          -  Any subject whose positive mammogram was not read during the truthing process (see
             section 8) will not be considered for the pivotal MRMC reader study.
