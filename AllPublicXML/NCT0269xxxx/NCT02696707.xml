  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several large adjuvant trastuzumab trials have demonstrated improved overall survival, in
      participants with early stage breast cancer, with a 33% decrease in risk of death. However,
      retrospective analyses of participant outcomes in these trials have demonstrated increased
      risk of cardiotoxicity (i.e damage to the heart) in a small number of patients (4-8%).

      At this time, investigators are unable to predict which participants are at increased risk of
      cardiac-related treatment complications. Currently all patients receive regular cardiac
      imaging throughout their one year of trastuzumab treatment.

      At this time, the optimal monitoring schedule for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity remains
      unknown, and several published consensus guidelines are currently in use as &quot;standard of
      care.
