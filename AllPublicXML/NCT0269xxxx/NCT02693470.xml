  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Psoriasis, a common inflammatory disease, is associated with atherosclerotic
      vascular diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and impaired microcirculations,
      among which circulating microparticles play an important role. In severe psoriasis, there are
      increased endothelial- and platelet- microparticles that are reduced by TNF-Î± blockers in
      parallel with clinical improvement. However, whether Stelara(ustekinumab) treatment would
      decrease the level of microparticles remains unknown.

      Objective: The investigators will evaluate the level of microparticles among normal control,
      severe psoriasis before and 4 months after ustekinumab treatment.

      Methods: The investigators will recruit 50 patients with severe psoriasis who received
      ustekinumab and 50 control subjects without psoriasis from August 2014 to July 2016.
      Concentrations of microparticles with expression for surface markers (Annexin V, CD31, and
      CD41a) will be measured in peripheral blood using flow cytometry.

    <description>50 patients with severe psoriasis received ustekinumab 45mg at 0 and 1 month. There were 50 healthy controls. The levels of circulating CD31 and CD41a positive microparticles are measured. In patients with psoriasis, the investigators measure microparticles in the baseline and 4 months after ustekinumab. For control group, the investigators measure microparticles in the baseline.</description>
