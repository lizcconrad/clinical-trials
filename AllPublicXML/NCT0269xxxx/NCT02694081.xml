      To search which is the better reconstructions by comparing and analyzing the advantages and
      disadvantages between Uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstructions after
      laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

      Method: It's a prospective study including all patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal
      gastrectomy (LADG) in the First Hospital of Jilin University, from February 2016 to February
      2017. All surgical procedures will be performed by the single surgery team, which is leaded
      by professor Wang Quan. The reconstruction method will be selected randomly from Uncut
      Roux-en-Y and Billroth II anastomosis by drawing lots preoperatively without distinct
      indications. Clinical data, operation data and perioperative complications and related
      physiological indexes of differences.
