  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of OSA is 3.5~4.6% in Chinese adults. OSA leads to repetitive hypoxemia,
      hypercapnia, and arousal from sleep and is an independent risk factor for hypertension,
      stroke, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. CPAP is the first-line
      treatment for OSA. But many patients do not adhere to therapy.

      The upper airway(UA) anatomical abnormality is a prominent risk factor in Asian OSA patients,
      which might be improved by surgical strategies. However, surgery shows variable clinical
      effectiveness. One important reason for patients responding poorly to single treatment
      procedure is that multiple abnormal physiological traits contribute to OSA.

      High loop gain is one of the key non-anatomical risk factors. It will be useful to
      individualize therapy in OSA by better understanding the reversibility of increased LG, the
      interaction of LG and UA anatomical change as well as the condition that trigger reduction of
      LG.

      The project will test the hypothesis of 1) Elevated LG is induced in some patients and is
      reversible by treatment of OSA; 2) Change of LG is related to the improvement of sleep apnea;
      3) An elevated LG is related to residual sleep apnea after upper airway surgery, which might
      be eliminated by adjunct CPAP therapy after surgery. The results would improve the efficiency
      of non-CPAP treatment and provide a potential combined treatment option for those patients
      with both elevated loop gain and anatomy risk factors in the Asian population.

    <textblock>
      Unstable respiratory control (high loop gain) is an important non-anatomical risk factor for
      obstructive sleep apnea. Studies showed high loop gain might also be acquired from long-term
      hypoxemia/hypercapnia due to OSA, and could be decreased by CPAP therapy in some of the
      individuals. Whether another treatment, i.e. upper airway surgery, could achieve a similar
      improvement in is not known. We hypothesize that 1) high LG could be reversible with improved
      hypoxemia and reduced apnea hypopnea index (AHI) by surgical treatment; 2) high loop gain at
      baseline may be associated with poor treatment outcomes.

      PSG was performed pre- and postoperatively to assess the OSA severity in participants who
      underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and concomitant transpalatal advancement pharyngoplasty.
      Loop gain were calculated using a published method by fitting a feedback control model to
      airflow. The loop gain values at baseline and follow-up were compared. The association
      between loop gain change and improvement of OSA were analyzed.
