      The aim is to evaluate if internet- delivered CBT, based on behavioral activation and
      exposure principles, improves wellbeing and QoL in symptomatic AF patients.The study will
      include 30 patients with symptomatic AF despite optimal medical treatment in accordance with
      current guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
      affecting 3% of the population. AF is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and large
      costs for society. In a considerable proportion of patients, AF symptoms (e.g., palpitations,
      fatigue, and chest pain) are not alleviated by current medical or interventional treatments.
      Psychological factors can worsen AF symptoms, and anxiety and depression are common among AF
      patients. Symptom preoccupation and avoidance of social and physical activities are likely to
      play important roles in the development of anxiety, depression, disability and healthcare
      utilization.

      The aim is to evaluate if CBT, based on behavioral activation and exposure principles,
      improves wellbeing and QoL in symptomatic AF patients.

      Method: Pilot study with a pre-post-design and no control group. The internet-delivered
      CBT-program will last for 10 weeks and include weekly therapist support, consisting of online
      messages and telephone calls.

    <description>The CBT treatment lasts for 10 weeks and includes the following: Education on the role of anxiety on cardiac function and the effects of symptom preoccupation and avoidance QoL and depression in AF, creating a vicious cycle; exposure to physical sensations that are similar to AF symptoms (e.g.,palpitations due to physical activity or stress) to reduce fear of these symptoms; exposure to situations or activities previously avoided and abolishment of behaviors that fruitlessly aim to prevent triggering of AF episodes or to control symptoms; and behavioral activation aiming to increase social and physical activity and reduce depressive symptoms. Therapist support is provided at least once weekly through the platform developed for the purpose. Therapists are trained CBT-psychologists.</description>
