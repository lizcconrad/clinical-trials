      This study investigates the effect of titanium-prepared platelet-rich fibrin (T-PRF)
      treatment on the angiogenic biomarkers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in infrabony
      defects of patients with chronic periodontitis. In each patient, the infrabony defect of one
      side of arch was designated as control group (allograft), while the infrabony defect on the
      contralateral side of same arch was designated as test group (allograft+T-PRF).

      Platelets are the cells initiating the wound healing and also supporting it by secreting
      various growth factors actively. These growth factors released by platelets act the increase
      of connective tissue healing, bone regeneration and repair, fibroblast mitogenesis, wound
      angiogenesis and the activation of macrophages by stimulating cell proliferation signals.

      Titanium-prepared, platelet-rich fibrin (T-PRF), is a new platelet concentrate, is formed in
      titanium tubes may be more efficient to activate platelets in comparison with glass tubes.The
      titanium tubes is utilized to refrain any inverse effects of glass tubes and also silica.
