    <textblock>
      The Bakri intrauterine balloon can achieve haemostasis in cases of postpartum haemorrhage,
      including haemorrhage associated with placenta previa by compressing the lower uterine
      segment.

    <intervention_name>Abdominal traction stitch</intervention_name>
    <description>Abdominal traction stitch to prevent prolapse of the Bakri balloon. A suture is tied through the uterine end shaft hole of the Bakri balloon. The other end of the suture is placed through the uterine wall. The balloon is positioned in the lower segment.The abdominal traction stitch is held by forceps and fixed, with cephalad traction applied continuously to the balloon, preventing balloon prolapse.The abdominal traction stitch is fixed by an umbilical cord clamp on the abdominal wall, preventing the suture from receding into the abdominal cavity, and, thus, maintaining the correct position of the balloon and preventing prolapse. Removal of the balloon is easy, with no resistance; the suture does not hinder balloon removal. At the time of balloon removal, the suture that was placed through the abdominal wall will traverse the intra-abdominal and intrauterine cavities, and should be kept clean.</description>
