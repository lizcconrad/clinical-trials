          -  Subject must be diagnosed with a ventral or incisional midline hernia.

          -  Mesh must be placed in the retro-rectus or intraperitoneal plane.

          -  Subject must be willing to undergo open hernia repair and be able to undergo all other
             study procedures as outlined in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically significant (not based solely on creatinine levels) kidney
             disease that limits ADL, is on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

          -  Subject is American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Class 4 or 5.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy &lt; 2 years at the time of enrollment.

             of the study.

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity to porcine products.

          -  Subjects with allergy, history of allergy or hypersensitivity to tetracyclines
             (including minocycline) or rifamycins (including rifampin).

          -  Subject has any condition in the opinion of the Investigator that would preclude the
