      The purpose of this study is to examine if a psycho-educational intervention for caregivers
      of patients with dementia will decrease caregiver burden, increase caregiver physical
      activity, and decrease the reporting of behavioral and psychological symptoms of the person
      with dementia.

    <description>Powerful Tools for Caregivers is a 6-week psychoeducational program. Each week the caregivers will attend a 90-minute workshop in a group setting. These sessions will be co-led by two trained and certified leaders who follow the scripted program. In addition to providing education about caregiving and the importance of self-care, the classes will help caregivers develop self-care tools to manage personal stress and improve communication skills.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Caregiver lives with or provides care for the care recipient for an average of at
             least 4 hours per day.

          -  Care for an individual with a physician diagnosis of dementia (mild to moderate stage
             of dementia).

          -  Care for a care recipient who experiences behavioral symptoms that bother or upset the
             caregiver moderately, very much, or extremely. The occurrence of problematic behaviors
             and caregivers' reactions will be assessed with 6-items adapted from the Revised
             Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (Teri et al 1992).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Care for a care recipient who is bed-bound or has advanced dementia: Functional
             Assessment Staging (FAST)(Sclan &amp; Reisberg 1992) stage 7.

          -  Caregiver's cognitive, hearing, visual, or other physical impairments lead to
             difficulty with informed consent process, assessment, or participation in the
             intervention.

          -  Caregiver who is involved in another trial that addresses caregiver burden or
             behavioral expressions.
