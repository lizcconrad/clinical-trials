  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramadan fasting entails abstinence from eating and drinking between dawn and sunset. During
      this month major changes in meal times and patterns, sleeping times and activity occur.
      Starvation is known to lead to a compensatory reduction in energy expenditure. However, the
      Ramadan fast is not synonymous with starvation as it involves intermittent periods of fasting
      followed by gorging. People who fast during Ramadan feel less energetic. However, little is
      known about the effects of this religious practice on energy metabolism. .

      The aim of this study is to assess energy dynamics before and/or after and during Ramadan
      fasting in non-obese participants. Resting metabolic rate (RMR), thermic effect of food
      (TEF), active energy expenditure (AEE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in free-living
      conditions will be measured . Indirect calorimetry will be used to assess RMR and TEF, doubly
      labeled water will be used to measure TEE and activity monitors will measure physical
      activity. In addition, body composition analysis will be performed by bio-electrical
      impedance. Blood sample will be taken to exclude medical factors affecting energy metabolism.
