      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment
      significantly reduces the number of epileptic seizures in cases of autoimmune epilepsy.
      Potential participants will be screened at an outpatient neurology clinic visit appointment.
      Interested qualified potential participants will be consented and offered participation in
      this trial. Once consent has been obtained, and it is determined that the participant meets
      all inclusion criteria, the participant will be randomized to either IVIG or placebo
      treatment for the next 5 weeks. Participants will return to Mayo Clinic for an evaluation.
      Those participants that received the placebo for 5 weeks will be given IVIG in an open label
      fashion for 5 weeks (week 7-11) then return to Mayo Clinic for evaluation. All participants
      will receive monthly phone calls after they complete the IVIG treatment for a period of 1
      year from the end of IVIG 5 week course.

    <description>Patients will maintain their stable dose of antiepileptic medications while receiving placebo. The dose will be based on ideal weight not to exceed 80 grams. Patients will receive placebo daily for 1 day [week 1 day 1], then they will receive placebo daily for 1 day [week 1 day 2]. Once every 2 weeks patients will receive placebo for 4 weeks [week 3 and 5] for 2 infusions. After completion of all 4 infusions all patients will be again evaluated at Mayo Clinic [week 6] and unblinded. The placebo group will then receive IVIG in an open label fashion in their homes through Option Care.
Option Care will administer IVIG (0.5g/kg not exceeding 80 gr) 1 day [week 7 day 1] then IVIG (1g/kg not exceeding 80 gr) for 1 day [week 7 day 2], then once every 2 weeks for 4 weeks (0.6g/kg IVIG) [week 9 and 11]. Patients will be evaluated at Mayo Clinic [week 12]. All will receive monthly telephone calls for one year after their last study infusion.</description>

    <description>Patients will maintain their stable dose of antiepileptic medications while receiving IVIG. The IVIG dose will be determined based on ideal weight with a dose not to exceed 80 grams. Patients will receive IVIG (0.5g/kg) daily for 1 day [week 1 day 1], then they will receive IVIG (1g/kg not exceeding 80 gr) daily for 1 day [week 1 day 2]. Patients will also receive 500 ml normal saline before and after the higher dose infusion of 1g/kg. Then once every 2 weeks patients will receive 0.6g/kg IVIG for 4 weeks [week 3 and 5] for 2 infusions. After completion of all 4 infusions all patients will be again evaluated at Mayo Clinic [week 6]. All patients will receive monthly telephone calls for one year after their last study infusion.</description>
