  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the recommended dose of MK-8628 (formerly known as OTX015) for
      further studies in participants with advanced nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline
      carcinoma (NMC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This is a two-part parallel study: Part A will
      establish the recommended dose by evaluating dose limiting toxicity (DLT), safety,
      discontinuation, and early efficacy and Part B will enroll participants with NMC only and
      will evaluate safety and efficacy in this population.

    <description>Participants (up to 14) in Part A will receive MK-8628 Dose Level 1. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be used to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) during the first cycle.
