  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the ability of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
      technologies to provide a diagnosis in a group of participants with suspected leukodystrophy
      as determined by clinical symptoms, including MRI imaging, but without a specific genetic
      diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness and clinical utility of whole genome sequencing will also be
      investigated as part of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with broad clinical
      manifestations and variable pathologic mechanisms. Leukodystrophies are a group of
      approximately 30 genetic diseases that primarily affect the white matter of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and remain a diagnostic challenge for clinicians and researchers. As a
      whole, leukodystrophies are relatively common (approximately 1 in 7000 births). This
      genetically heterogeneous set of disorders is categorized based on initial findings of white
      matter abnormalities in the CNS. Historically, these abnormalities were identified using
      gross pathology. More recently, neuroimagery has been used for diagnostic purposes. However,
      more than half of the suspected leukodystrophies do not have a definitive diagnosis, and are
      classified as &quot;leukodystrophies of unknown etiology&quot;. Even when a diagnosis is achieved, the
      diagnostic process lasts an average of eight years and results in test expenses in excess of
      $8,000 on average per patient, including the majority of patients who never achieve a
      diagnosis at all. These diagnostic challenges represent an urgent and unresolved gap in
      knowledge and disease characterization, as obtaining a definitive diagnosis is of paramount
      importance for leukodystrophy patients. The diagnostic workup begins with findings on cranial
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) followed by sequential targeted genetic testing, however
      next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) offer the promise of rapid and more cost
      effective approaches. In general, NGS has the potential to revolutionize medical research and
      diagnostics, particularly for rare diseases - 80% of which are genetic in origin. In the last
      two years, the pace of discovery has increased at a remarkable rate due to the use of whole
      genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Recent reports suggest that WES can
      yield insights into previously ambiguous rare genetic disorders. For example, large-scale WES
      projects have been used to identify new nosologic entities using clinical and molecular data
      in adult onset leukodystrophy, neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy/ epileptic
      encephalopathies, degenerative ataxia, and intellectual disability. In clinical settings, WES
      has also been shown to provide diagnoses for atypical presentations of established disorders.
      Overall, diagnostic yields for large disease cohorts range from 16-53%.

      Despite these advances in diagnostic efficacy, there are still significant issues with
      respect to implementation of NGS in clinical settings. Given the unmet diagnostic need
      amongst patients with persistently unresolved white matter disorders, and the potential for
      agnostic NGS testing to clarify these cases, the investigators propose a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of 200 leukodystrophy patients at the time of initial confirmation of
      MRI abnormalities, with prospective collection of patients randomly received on a &quot;first
      come, first served&quot; basis from a network of expert clinical sites. All participants will
      undergo WGS in parallel to standard clinical testing in a staggered fashion. The WGS testing
      will be performed in a clinical services laboratory that is certified under Clinical
      Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP). This
      approach aims to assess the diagnostic validity and utility of NGS approaches, with primary
      outcome measures including time to diagnosis and whether or not a diagnosis was achieved.

      The investigators anticipate that the results of this study will serve as a pilot for similar
      approaches in other rare disease cohorts, and will ultimately help in establishing the
      utility of WGS as a first-line diagnostic tool for patients with suspected genetic
      conditions.

    <description>Subjects will continue to receive standard clinical care according to existing algorithms based on MRI pattern recognition and will receive clinically indicated testing as considered appropriate by the expert clinician. This may include further clinical diagnostic testing as ordered by a neurologist or geneticist with specialized experience in leukodystrophy. The diagnostic testing must not include NGS (WES or WGS), though enzymatic assays, analytic testing, or sequencing by single or targeted panels will be permitted.
Crossover to Experimental Arm will occur if no diagnosis has been achieved within four (4) months of study enrollment.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo immediate WGS-based testing in a CLIA/CAP-certified laboratory. This testing will include tiered analysis of leukodystrophy associated genes, as defined by those disorders characterized by experts as resulting in leukodystrophies or genetic leukoencephalopathies. These results will be filtered for structural and copy number variations, and followed-up with comprehensive analysis of novel genes in coding regions if participants remain unsolved.</description>
