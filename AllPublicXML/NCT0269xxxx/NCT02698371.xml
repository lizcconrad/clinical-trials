      The purpose is to evaluate/compare clinical effectiveness of dual cure (DC) all-in-one
      Self-Etch (Futurabond® DC (FBDC)) adhesive and multimode/universal (Futurabond® U (FU) and
      Adhese® Universal (AU)) adhesives, with or without selective enamel etching, in non-carious
      cervical lesions (NCCL), during 24th months, using Word Dental Federation (FDI) and United
      States Public Health Services (USPHS) criteria.

      The null hypotheses are:

      H0 - Bonding to NCCLs with DC-SE and SE-Universal adhesives with SE strategies will result in
      similar (no significant differences) clinical (aesthetic, functional and biologic)
      behaviour/performance in a period of 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs with DC-SE
      and SE-Universal adhesives with SE strategies will result in similar restorations (aesthetic,
      functional and biologic) success rates over 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs with
      DC-SE and SE-Universal adhesives with SE strategies will result in similar restoration
      retention rates in a period of 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs DC-SE with enamel
      pre-etching and Universal adhesives with ER adhesive strategy will result in similar (no
      significant differences) clinical (aesthetic, functional and biologic) behaviour/performance
      in a period of 24thmonth evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs DC-SE with enamel pre-etching and
      Universal adhesives with ER adhesive strategy will result in similar restorations (aesthetic,
      functional and biologic) success rates over 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs
      DC-SE with enamel pre-etching and Universal adhesives with ER adhesive strategy will result
      in similar restoration retention rates in a period of 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to
      NCCLs with FBDC or FU (DC adhesives) and AU (Light-curing adhesive) with SE or ER adhesive
      strategies will result in similar (no significant differences) clinical (aesthetic,
      functional and biologic) behaviour/performance in a period of 24th month evaluation; H0 -
      Bonding to NCCLs with FBDC or FU (DC adhesives) and AU (Light-curing adhesive) with SE or ER
      adhesive strategies will result in similar restorations (aesthetic, functional and biologic)
      success rates over 24th month evaluation; H0 - Bonding to NCCLs with FBDC or FU (DC
      adhesives) and AU (Light-curing adhesive) with SE or ER adhesive strategies will result in
      similar restoration retention rates in a period of 24th month evaluation; H0 - FDI or USPHS
      criteria evaluation outcomes not differ for the same data.

      2.1- DESIGN The trial design will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT) statement (1, 2).

      Prospective, double blind, clinical trial; randomized allocation of NCCL restorations by six
      adhesion treatment groups (6 arms: G1 to G6) for examination of restorations performance.

      Study will take place in University Fernando Pessoa - Faculty of Health Sciences (UFP-FHS),
      Dental Medicine School Clinic. Patients recruitment between November 2015 and April 2016.
      Restorations estimated to be done until April 2016.

      Period of Study The study is scheduled to last 24th months. Baseline clinical observation
      will be done 30 days after placement of adhesion restoration (First data), second evaluation
      12th months after baseline (Second data), and last evaluation 24th months after baseline data
      (Third data). Clinical trial may continue for similar assessment intervals, after 24th months
      evaluation. This situation requires new analysis according to clinical and economics
      conditions, at that time.

      2.2- POPULATION AND PARTICIPANT SELECTION

      All participants will be informed (Written and verbal information) about the trial conditions
      and purposes, but will not be aware of what tooth will received the adhesion treatment
      strategy under evaluation. Written informed consent, according to World Medical Association
      Declaration of Helsinki (3), will be obtained from all participants prior to starting the
      treatment. University Fernando Pessoa Ethics Committee review and approved the present
      protocol. This clinical trial is done according to the National Law 21/2014, of 16 April, and
      was analysed, approved and authorized by the National Competent Authorities:

        -  INFARMED, National Authority of Medicines and Health Products, IP (No.EC/011/2015;
           DPS/DM/450.10.053/2015/0314; Authorization at 4th August 2015)

        -  CEIC, National Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (No.20150305; Approved at 3th
           August 2015)

        -  CNPD, Portuguese Data Protection Authority (Authorization and registry 6430/2015 at 7
           July 2015; No.2536/2015).

      The decision to participate in this study is voluntary as well as the decision to refuse
      participation and decision of withdrawal of the same, at any time of the study course, are
      rights of the patient/participant. Given the purpose of this study, and the fact of existing
      multiple and several market therapeutic alternative for this type of interventions, the fact
      that participate in this study will not entail any additional cost, the one described in the
      fee schedule of Dental Medicine School Clinic-UFP. They will not be granted any incentives or
      financial benefits (payment of travel or counter-parties) to participate in the trial. The
      participant has as cost the &quot;restoration of the tooth surface, which of course would have to
      make even not participating in this investigation. The clinical observations, temporarily
      established (3 appointments in two years), to evaluate the performance of the restorations
      will be free for the participants. All other acts that the patient needs or intends to
      perform, not included in the protocol of this trial, should meet the same, the fee scale of
      Dental Medicine School Clinic-UFP. Dental restorations are applied to tooth surfaces
      requiring intervention/repair for the maintenance of dental structure in oral cavity of the
      patient. The operator (Dentist and Associate Professor of FHS-UFP) inform the
      patient/participant in all aspects related to the study. Refusal of patient participation,
      the participant's withdrawal and revocation of consent to participate in this study are
      rights of the patient/participant without any consequences or reprisal, and without
      interference in the relationship between users and teachers/ researchers / University,
      clinical entities.

      SAMPLE:

      Patients with clinical diagnosis of tooth structure coronal loss and needs for cervical
      (vestibular surface) restoration without chemical or bacterial origin, called non-carious
      cervical lesion (NCCL) located in pre- molars/molars (PM/M) teeth, with cavity dimensions
      defined in the study design; a patient can have up to 16 teeth (8PM + 8M) with NCCL.

      Two hundred and ten restorations will be performed, randomized in order to be allocated to
      six interventions, named as adhesion intervention groups.

      Within this trial, the number of teeth to be restored by participant will be between a
      minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. The allocation of the study group (G1 to G6) to a particular
      tooth is random with the information available to the operator/principal investigator in
      sealed envelopes and previously prepared by the investigator-professional statistics. The
      allocation of the study group (G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6) to each tooth for a patient is
      performed randomly, but ensuring that the distribution of the groups is not repeated in the
      same patient. For this purpose, 210 envelopes with 35 sequences of 6 study groups will be
      organized by the statistical investigator (wherein each order of 6 groups is randomized).

      If the patient has more than six teeth that meet the inclusion criteria, the selection of the
      premolars and molars to be included in the clinical trial will be conducted randomly by
      scenarios randomized by the investigator of the statistical area after participation and
      contact for the effect (not done a priori, since it is necessary 19448 scenarios prior
      randomization before observing any patient, whereas the possible teeth be selected for
      treatment is between 6 and 16 and the teeth to select from 6).

      The participant has as cost the academic/scientific honorary, as in usual clinical context of
      Dental School Clinic of Faculty of Health Sciences - UFP as &quot;restoration of a tooth surface&quot;/
      by tooth to restore (One to six teeth), which of course would have to make even not
      participating in the investigation, as the Dental School Clinic fee scale.

      The restorations included in this trial will be evaluated for clinical performance, for three
      time periods (Baseline, 1 year and 2 years), by the three calibrated examiners. These 3
      observation appointments, as part of the clinical trial, will be free for participants.

      2.3- STUDY ADHESION ARMS Six groups (G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6) of NCCL restorations will be
      randomized allocated according to adhesion strategy intervention.

      2.4- OPERATOR / EXAMINERS CALIBRATION Operator will do one restoration of each group in order
      to identify all steps involved in the application technique. This procedure will be done
      three times, with one week, interval. All restorations done by the same calibrated operator.
      Three experienced and calibrated dentists, not involved with the restoring procedures and
      therefore blinded to the group assignment, will perform the clinical evaluation. For training
      purposes, the examiners observed 10 photographs that were representative of each score for
      each criterion, in 10 cervical restorations (not included in this trial), each one, on two
      consecutive days. An intra-examiner and inter-examiner agreement will be calculated.

      2.5- DATA REGISTRY/PROTECTION AND RESTORATIONS PROCEDURES Photographs (digital data
      registration) will be carried out by the operator/responsible for research, strictly made to
      NCCL cavities and restorations as part of this trial. No photographs will be made to identify
      the patient, including photographs of the patient face or profile. All photographs taken in
      the context of this study will be &quot;identified&quot; (file name) with a single key (alphanumeric
      key without any kind of relationship with file number, name, date of birth or other
      information associated with the participant patient). Only in the registration database (with
      access to the principal investigator and other team members, with the exception of the
      statistical investigator for the purposes of observational clinical records) there should be
      registration/membership of this key with the code-process of patients. The database in
      question will be lodged in own servers with restricted access levels and well identified. The
      servers that lodge the photos/ records and the database belong to Dental School Clinic of
      Faculty of Health Sciences - UFP and are located in data centre with fully controlled access.
      This mechanism ensures the concealment of identity of the user (as name and other information
      identifying the participant) in the photographs and other records file, having access to them
      only the investigator and research team (except investigator of statistics). This mechanism
      fulfilled the recommendation and Authorisation of CNPD, Portuguese Data Protection Authority
      (Authorization and registry 6430/2015 at 7 July 2015; Case 2536/2015).

      Appointment and restorative procedures, in accordance with the following steps:

      One week, before the Restorative procedure (1st appointment): Inform the patient
      (Written/Verbal); Patient signature of informed consent; Fulfilment of the project clinical
      file (patient identification, general clinical summary, oral clinic examination, oral hygiene
      state); Dental prophylaxis with fluoride toothpaste and water with a nylon brush. Vitality
      tests (cold and hot) executed with spray Endo cool (ethyl chloride) and warm instrument;
      Pre-operative sensitivity evaluation by applying air for 10 seconds from a dental syringe
      placed 2 cm from the tooth surface (4); NCCLs cavities will be evaluated according to the
      degree (1, 2, 3, 4) of sclerotic dentin (5), cavity dimensions (H-height, W-width, and
      D-depth) in millimetres (mm) and geometry (evaluated by profile photograph, as Angles Acute
      (A), Severe (S), Obtuse (O) (4); 1st Appointment-Intervention: Initial intra-oral/cavity
      surface and tooth digital photography; Teeth anaesthesia with 3% mepivacaine (Scandinibsa,
      Sintra Business Park, Portugal); Operatory field isolation with cotton rolls and retraction
      floss (Ultradent). All cavities cleaned with pumice and water in a rubber cup, followed by
      rinsing and drying. Selection composite colour by shade guide; Adhesive interventions
      according to G1 to G6 arms assignment. Adhesive systems will be used as SingleDose mode.
      Composite restorations (AdmiraFusion Universal nano-hybrid composite) with incremental
      filling technique (two increments maximum), light-cured (LED Unit) with an intensity of
      1000mW/cm2, during 40 seconds. Restorations will be finished immediately with diamond disks
      (OptiDisc® medium 40μm; Kerr) and burns. Polishing performed with diamond-impregnated
      silicone polishers (Dimanto, Voco, CuxHaven) during 10 seconds. Intra-oral digital
      photography of the restoration.

      2.6- CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP Baseline (30 days after restoration), 12th and 24th months
      Appointments

      1 - Intra-oral digital photography of the NCCL restoration; 2- Post-operative sensitivity
      evaluation by applying air for 10 seconds from a dental syringe placed 2 cm from the tooth
      surface (4); 3 - Direct evaluation by 3 calibrated examiners according to FDI (6, 7) and
      USPHS (8); 4- Data register Study variable definition - Clinical/direct observation and
      performance evaluation acceptance by means of FDI (FDI World Dental Federation - clinical
      criteria for the evaluation of direct restorations) (6, 7) and USPHS (8).

      2.7- DATA BASE AND STATISTICAL ANALISYS Data statistical analysis and description according
      to aims of this trial; Specific program for statistical data analysis (IBM(c) SPSS(c)
      Statistics vs. 23 or later) will be used.

      The changes in parameters will be assessed Qui2 and Fisher exact tests for the cross
      sectional assessment of the six groups treatment groups at baseline, one year and two years.
      For a paired comparison analysis and to determine differences between treatments with regard
      to aesthetic, functional and biological parameters between baseline and the two-year
      follow-up (longitudinal assessment), the McNemar test will be used. To quantify the relative
      influence of patients' covariates (ie, smoking habits, oral hygiene) on clinical performance
      of the restorations, Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression will be used. Differences will be
      considered to be significant at P&lt;0.05.

      2.8- OBSERVATIONS REGARDING SAMPLE CALCULATION Was assumed that the minimum number of bonded
      restorations to be held in each of the six arms (G1 to G6) is 35 (210 restorations). The
      researchers did not have detailed information that allows the estimation of the sample size
      based on power analysis (the effect of the expected difference to the end of the time
      considered for the study). Thus, using rules of thumb usually considered in research
      situations where there is no prior information concerning the performance evaluation of these
      class IIa medical devices available on the market. In this case, considering that it intends
      to make a prospective longitudinal study, in which the result &quot;failure&quot; can be data
      processing target through Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression to determine factors
      associated with failure rate and reduced clinical performance criteria of the restorations
      (evaluation of clinical performance over time, of the medical devices under study), and to
      detect effects depends the number of events (failure, for example, or other event that is to
      be considered in the defined evaluation criteria) and not the number of
      patients/participants, the thumb rules stipulate a minimum of 10 cases by group. Moreover,
      when considering an &quot;simple&quot; analysis comparison using a McNemar test (repeated measures) in
      six groups would be necessary in total, including at least 80 cases (to restore teeth) in the
      sample. When considering at least 35 restorations by group, researchers are greatly
      increasing the minimum number stipulated in any of the aforementioned techniques. In
      addition, clinical studies previously performed on this issue (between 2004 and 2012)
      relative to the post-market clinical evaluation performance of class IIa medical devices, in
      the context of restorative dentistry field, has enabled to measure a minimum of 30
      restorations as viable for determining events in a short/medium-term as the clinical
      performance evaluation of a similar nature of medical devices.

      2.9- GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH

      Reporting mechanism of possible adverse incident during the investigation will be held
      according to Medical Devices (MD) commercially available in the market, so it interprets and
      assumes the issue as applicable to assumptions in the Portuguese National Law (Article 22)
      21/2014, of 16 April, calling up a mechanism for reporting any incidents inherent to medical
      devices or resulting from the use of medical devices. In this way, and considering the type
      of intervention to carry out in this research (restoration of very small extension of NCCL
      with dental adhesives), the medical devices (Adhesive systems) are not described in the
      literature and not known records for the occurrence of undesirable incidents, with
      interpretative effects as Serious or Unexpected &quot;adverse incidents&quot;. However, and according
      to good clinical practice for clinical research, the reporting mechanism of Serious or
      Unexpected incidents (protocol version FHS-UFP-FFP-2014 April-19.07.2015) for this research
      are approved by CEIC (National Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (No.20150305; Approved
      at 3th August 2015), as followed:

        1. Clinical knowledge of the incident taken by the principal investigator;

        2. Register of occurrence and possible reasons associated with it;

        3. Clear Information to the participant about the serious or unexpected adverse occurrence,
           providing urgent measures as may be appropriate to safety protect the subjects against
           any immediate risk or any fact relating to the conduct of the trial.

        4. The investigator notifies the clinical Director and the Sponsor within 24 hours of all
           serious or unexpected events, and the defects of devices that could have led to a
           serious adverse event, except those conditions that are identified in the protocol (loss
           of retention of the adhesive restoration) or in the investigator's brochure as not
           requiring immediate reporting;

        5. Investigator presents to the sponsor a detailed written report, within five days.

        6. The Sponsor ensure that:

             1. All important data regarding serious adverse events related to the clinical trial,
                which has caused or may cause death or severe deterioration of the health status of
                participants, users or third parties involved in the study, they are recorded and
                notified to the National Authorities INFARMED (National Authority of Medicines and
                Health Products, IP) and CEIC (National Ethics Committee for Clinical Research),
                immediately and not more than two days from the moment in which aware of them;

             2. - Another type of adverse events, in particular regarding defects of medical
                devices that could have led to a serious adverse event and new data on any adverse
                event is recorded and notified National Authorities, INFARMED (National Authority
                of Medicines and Health Products, IP) and CEIC (National Ethics Committee for
                Clinical Research), within a period of seven days, starting from the moment they
                become aware of them. All supervening information considered relevant by the
                competent authorities will be notified within eight days from the closing date
                provided for in the preceding paragraph.

        7. The investigator sends to the sponsor, the CEIC and INFARMED any additional information
           that may be requested.

        8. Sponsor keeps detailed records of all adverse events, which are reported to him, by any
           investigator.

        9. Other suspected serious and unexpected adverse events are reported by the sponsor to the
           CEIC, INFARMED and CNPD within 15 days from its notice by the promoter.

      Sponsor reports annually to CEIC and INFARMED a list of all suspected serious adverse events,
      during this period as well as a report on the safety of participants, if applicable. Under
      the study protocol (Version FCS-UFP-FFP-2014 April-19.07.2015), all the possible non-serious
      adverse events such as, clinical signs or symptoms associated with loss of aesthetic,
      functional and biological performance of restorations and situations described in the
      instructions, labelling and safety data sheets of medical devices or even, without incident
      and security maintenance data of the participants the sponsor notifies the CEIC and INFARMED,
      only by the final evaluation of this study (two years of clinical performance), as set forth
      in article 24th of Law 21/2014 of 16 April, which will include a report of suspicious
      occurrences and safety records and, if applicable, in the clinical trial in the period
      Evaluation of two years. Or annually, if the CEIC advise, even in the absence of adverse
      events or information, justifying changes to the safety of participants.
