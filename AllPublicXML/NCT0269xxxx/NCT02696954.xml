      Primary Objective

        -  To characterize the potential pharmacokinetic interactions of artemether -lumefantrine,
           amodiaquine and primaquine in healthy adult subjects.

      Secondary Objectives

           and primaquine when given alone and in combination.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of co-administered artemether-lumefantrine,
           amodiaquine and primaquine.

        -  To investigate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting drug levels of
           artemether-lumefantrine, amodiaquine and primaquine and their metabolites.

      The study design is an open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy G6PD normal Thai subjects.
      This study will enroll 16 healthy subjects. Participants who pass the screening process will
      have 6 admissions in the hospital to receive 6 drug regimens as below

      First admission visit: The subject may be randomized to receive either
      Artemether-Lumefantrine or Amodiaquine with 6-10 weeks washout period.

      Second admission visit: Subject who receives Artemether-Lumefantrine from previous visit will
      receive amodiaquine in this visit and vice versa. This visit will required 6-10 weeks washout
      period.

      Third admission visit: Every subject will receive Artemether-lumefantrine and Amodiaquine
      with 6-10 weeks washout period.

      Forth admission visit: Every subject will receive Primaquine with 1-5 weeks washout period.

      Fifth admission visit: Subject may randomize to receive either Artemether-Lumefantrine and
      Primaquine or Artemether-Lumefantrine and Amodiaquine and Primaquine in this visit with 6-10
      weeks washout period.

      Sixth admission visit: Subject who receives Artemether-Lumefantrine and Amodiaquine and
      primaquine from previous visit will receive Artemether-Lumefantrine and Primaquine in this
      visit and vice versa.

               -  or of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
                  and prior to start the study drug in each period, and abstain from sexual
                  intercourse or agrees to using effective contraceptive methods (e.g.,
                  intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptive drug, tubal ligation or female
                  barrier method with spermicide) during the study until completion of the
                  follow-up procedures

          4. A male is eligible to enter and participate in this study if he: agrees to abstain
             from sexual intercourse with females of childbearing potential or lactating females;
             or is willing to use a condom/spermicide, during the study until completion of the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or are lactating.

          2. The subject has evidence of active substance abuse that may compromise safety,
             pharmacokinetics, or ability to adhere with protocol instructions.

          3. A positive pre-study hepatitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis C antibody, or
             positive human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antibody result at screening.

             arrhythmias, syncopal episodes, or additional risk factors for torsades de pointes
             (heart failure, hypokalemia) or with a family history of sudden cardiac death.

          5. A creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault equation:

             CLcr (mL/min) = (140 - age) * Wt / (72 * Scr) (multiply answer by 0.85 for females)
             Where age is in years, weight (wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine (Scr) is in units of
             mg/dL [Cockcroft, 1976].

          6. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within 6 months of the study.

          7. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs except paracetamol at doses of up to 2

             Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 times
             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety; the investigator will take advice from the manufacturer
             representative as necessary.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 x half-life, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             medication.

          9. The subject is unwilling to abstain from ingesting alcohol within 48 hours prior to
             the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic
             sample during each regimen.

         10. Subjects who have donated blood to the extent that participation in the study would
             result in more than 300 mL blood donated within a 30-day period. Note: This does not
             include plasma donation.

         11. Subjects who have a history of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.

         13. AST or ALT &gt;1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)

         14. Subjects with history of renal disease, hepatic disease, and/or cholecystectomy

         15. G6PD deficient

         16. Abnormal methemoglobin level (more than 3 mg/dL).

         17. History of antimalarial drugs use including but not limited to mefloquine,
             chloroquine, primaquine, artesunate, piperaquine and pyronaridine treatment within 6
             months.

         18. Subject who received quinacrine in last 30 days.
