  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute or chronic liver failure (fulminant hepatitis or advanced cirrhosis) disrupts brain
      physiology. Beyond classical hepatic encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension may
      occur.During liver transplantation (LT) surgery, many factors can lead to cerebral assault.
      In addition, intracranial hypertension measured with invasive methods has been described in
      certain phases of LT, especially at the time of reperfusion.

      The invasive monitoring of the intracranial pressure is not used in these patients, due to a
      high risk of infection and bleeding. The non-invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure has
      been widely developed in recent years : transcranial doppler and recently ultrasound of the
      optic nerve sheath (ONSD) allow an effective detection of intracranial hypertension.
