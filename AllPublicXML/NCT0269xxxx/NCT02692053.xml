  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis induces hemostatic disorders due to the exessive or inappropriate activation of
      inflammation, which could lead either to hypercoagulability or hypocoagulability. It is
      currently not possible to determine the hemostatic status of a given patient. This
      instability of hemostatic system is not revealed by classical tests. Thus, a better
      characterization of hemostatic status could certainly improve patient care. This study aims
      at characterizing disorders of coagulation and fibrinolysis using &quot;global&quot; tests such as
      thrombin generation test or coagulolytic test. Furthermore, the association with biological
      markers of interest (such as microparticles, neutrophil elastase or histones) will be
      evaluated.
