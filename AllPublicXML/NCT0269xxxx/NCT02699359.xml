    <textblock>
      The HS-1000 is an innovative non-invasive monitoring device that employs advanced acoustic
      signal analysis to calculate ICP on a continuous basis. Initial HS-1000 clinical data also
      shows promise in assessing a variety of cerebral hemodynamic parameters such as cerebral
      blood-flow, auto regulation monitoring, and cerebrovascular vessels compliance. In the
      absence of a non-invasive monitor of intracranial pressure (ICP), the relationships, if any,
      that may exist between concussion, timing of the concussion (e.g. acute, resolving, resolved)
      and ICP is unknown. The new HS-1000 non-invasive device may provide insight into assessment
      of possible ICP changes following concussion in children.

    <textblock>
      Unlike fractures, concussion can be difficult to recognize and diagnose, given lack of
      specific diagnostic tests or clinical findings. Current diagnostic recommendations include a
      multi-factorial approach involving symptom inventory, baseline and post-injury
      neuropsychological assessment, and balance testing.

      Lacking from this paradigm is a truly objective measure of physiological changes associated
      with concussion. In addition, post-concussion symptoms are unique to each individual and vary
      in occurrence, degree, and severity. For these reasons, a clinical diagnosis of concussion
      should be made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in
      concussion symptom recognition and evaluation.

      This study aims to determine ICP measurements derived from the HS-1000 non-invasive device in
      children and adolescents seen in the Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic for
      concussion (anytime during their care) compared to ICP values obtained in age and gender
      matched Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic patients with no history of head
      injury.

      Patients with a history and/or symptoms of head trauma cared for in the Akron Children's
      Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic will be invited to participate in this study. Study
      participants will receive HS-1000 ICP readings for a continuous 16 minute interval in a 30
      degree supine position. Recordings will be obtained in one session. When possible, these
      recordings will be obtained at their initial examination and all follow-up visits. Sports
      Medicine staff will coordinate the HS-1000 device earplug insertion and recordings so as not
      to interfere with, nor marginally delay the patient's normal, routine clinical evaluation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients 12 to &lt; 18 years of age being seen for, diagnosed with, and/or treated
             for traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine
             Concussion Clinic are eligible for enrollment in this study.

          -  The control group will consist of demographically comparable patients being treated at
             the Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Center unrelated to head trauma. These
             non-brain injured study participants will receive the same ICP monitoring device
             measurements at their initial examination and follow-up visits as performed in
             concussed patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving therapy for otitis media

          -  Subject with bony abnormality of the skull secondary to previous fracture or other
             cause that may impede HeadSense device

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the test materials or contraindication to
             test materials

          -  For females of childbearing potential: pregnancy (positive pregnancy test)

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in or less than 30 days post-participation in other
             investigational device or drug study(s), or receiving other investigational agent(s)

          -  Any condition that may jeopardize study participation or interpretation of study
             results (e.g., abnormal clinical finding), or may impede the ability to obtain
             informed consent (e.g., developmental delay of patient or caretaker)
