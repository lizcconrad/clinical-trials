  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants were classified as normal or malnourished according to anthropometric measures.
      Serum albumin and zinc were recovered on the 1st and 7th days of hospitalization. Lymphocyte
      count was also recorded on the 1st and 7th days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 14 consecutive patients with sepsis. Patients were classified as
      normal or malnourished according to anthropometric measures. As an additional evaluation of
      nutritional status, serum albumin and zinc were recovered on the 1st and 7th days of
      hospitalization. Lymphocyte count was also recorded on the 1st and 7th days. Investigators
      correlated nutritional status with lymphocyte count and zinc dosage.
