      Quantitative Genioglossal muscle strength in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSAS) defined in the
      clinical spectrum of subjects with Snoring Disturbance, Oral Appliance Therapy Responsive,
      and CPAP Responsive
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To describe by statistical analysis the normal distribution domain of genioglossus muscle
      strength in each of the four clinical stages of Sleep Apnea; and, by regression analysis, to
      explore the possibility of an inverse relationship between decreasing genioglossus strength
      and progression of the clinical stages of OSAS.

      1.3. To test the hypothesis that a &quot;subpopulation of subject&quot; exists within the clinical
      spectrum of OSAS, in whom decreasing strength of the genioglossus muscle may represent a
      common element in spite of differing possible pathophysiologic pathways leading to
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea in man. 1.4. The major hypothesis of this proposal is thus that
      &quot;Genioglossal Strength is inversely correlated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Pathology.&quot;
