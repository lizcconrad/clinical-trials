  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicentre, double-blind, controlled, randomized phase II study
      comparing the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib versus
      fulvestrant plus placebo in postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic
      breast cancer who have received ≥5 years of endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting as
      treatment for early disease and remained disease free for &gt; 12 months following its
      completion or have &quot;de novo&quot; metastatic disease. Patients must have at least one lesion
      (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is
      suitable for repeated assessment by CT, MRI or plan x-ray. Patients with bone-only disease
      must have a lytic or mixed (lytic + blastic) lesion, which has not been previously irradiated
      and can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI or x-ray. Approximately 190 patients will be
      randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (approximately 95 patients treated with
      fulvestrant plus palbociclib) and the control arm (approximately 95 patients treated with
      fulvestrant plus placebo).

      Primary Objective:

      • To compare the efficacy of fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib versus fulvestrant
      plus placebo in terms of the rate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 1 year in
      postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously
      treated with endocrine therapy for at least 5 years and remaining disease free for more than
      12 months following its completion or have &quot;de novo&quot; metastatic disease

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has signed and dated the informed consent document and it has been
             obtained before conducting any procedure specifically for the study.

          2. Availability of a tumor tissue sample, archival (primary tumour) or from the
             metastatic lesions (preferable) for the central ER, PgR and HER2 testing.

          3. Histological/cytological confirmation of breast cancer with evidence of metastatic
             disease (loco-regional or distant), not amenable to resection or radiation therapy

             on the most recent tumour biopsy.

          5. Documented HER2-negative tumour based on central testing on the most recent tumour
             biopsy. HER2-negative tumour is determined as immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or

          6. Patients must have received at least 5 years of endocrine therapy in the adjuvant
             setting as treatment for early disease and remained disease free for more than 12
             months following its completion or have &quot;de novo&quot; metastatic disease. Patients that
             have been scheduled 5 years with adjuvant endocrine therapy and stopped treatment, by
             patient's own decision, after completing at least 3 years of treatment, can be also be

                  protocol, e.g. uncontrolled cardiac disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

          9. QTc interval &gt; 480msec, family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome,
             Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes.

             bowel syndrome, unresolved nausea, vomiting, active inflammatory bowel disease or
             diarrhoea of CTCAE grade &gt; 1.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
