      The goal of this research study is learn if Behavioral Activation Treatment (BATS) or Health
      Education/Smoking Cessation counseling (HE), combined with the nicotine patch, can help
      people with different types of emotion and attention levels quit smoking.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to Group 1 or 2.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive an active nicotine patch and BATS counseling,
           which focuses on helping to increase rewarding experiences while quitting smoking.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive an active nicotine patch and Health Education/
           Smoking Cessation counseling, which focuses on coping strategies for not smoking and
           related health issues.

      You will not know which group you are assigned to.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will start using your nicotine patches on your scheduled quit day, which is about 4 weeks
      from the beginning of the study (the day before Visit 4).

      You should apply the nicotine patch to the upper arm. You should put it in a slightly
      different place each day to avoid skin irritation. You may take the patch off at night to
      avoid sleeping problems.

      You will be given a study diary to record how many cigarettes you smoke (if any) each day
      while you are on study.

      You must return your study diary and any unused study patches at Visit 9.

      Study Visits (Visits 1-9):

      At Visit 1:

        -  Urine or saliva will be collected for a routine test to check your nicotine, cotinine
           and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when it breaks down
           nicotine and will show whether and how much you have recently smoked. Anabasine is used
           to show if nicotine is found in the urine due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from
           tobacco use.

        -  Your CO level and weight will be measured.

        -  You will also perform tasks related to smoking behavior that will take 45 minutes.

      At every study visit:

        -  You will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide,
           your smoking behavior, and any side effects from the study patch. These questionnaires
           should take about 45-60 minutes in total to complete. Your counselor will not have
           access to the computer questionnaires so that your responses will be kept confidential.

        -  You will receive counseling about quitting smoking, where you will talk about possible
           &quot;triggers&quot; for smoking and strategies for dealing with quitting smoking. These sessions
           will take about 45 minutes each. These sessions may be audiotaped.

      During counseling on Visit 1, you will set a &quot;quit date&quot; for stopping smoking, about 3 weeks
      later. You should not quit smoking before the quit date. You may also set goals to reduce
      your smoking before that point. You should try to stay smoke-free after the quit date. You
      will also be given a drug instruction sheet, a card with emergency contact information, and a
      participant manual to help you follow along with the topics discussed during counseling.

      You may be asked to complete assignments at home in between visits.

      Lab Session:

      You will take part in a lab session at or before Visit 1 to test your brain activity. You
      will be asked to watch a series of slides. The slides will include pictures of people,
      nature, and artwork. Slides showing nude people, medical procedures, and victims of car
      crashes will also be shown. You will be shown examples of these slides before beginning the
      procedure and given the opportunity to withdraw from the study at that point.

      During the lab session, your brain electrical activity will be checked with an
      electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, small sensors will be placed on your scalp and face.
      You should not drink more than 2 cups of coffee or other caffeinated drinks for at least 2Â½
      hours before the session. At the lab session, you may be asked to smoke a cigarette if the
      doctor thinks it is needed for you to show your normal smoking behavior.

      You will also complete computer tasks, including questionnaires that will measure your
      emotions and attention level. These tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete.

      The lab session may last up to 2 hours total.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will receive the nicotine patch and counseling for up to 8 weeks. You will be taken off
      study early if the study staff thinks it is in your best interest or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (Visits 9 and 10,
      below).

      End-of-Treatment Visit (Visit 9):

      After you have finished using the nicotine patch, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  Urine or saliva may be collected to measure your cotinine and anabasine levels.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.

      Follow-Up Visit (Visit 10):

      At about 3 months after you have stopped smoking, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  Urine or saliva may be collected to measure your cotinine and anabasine levels.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.

      This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch is FDA approved and commercially
      available to help people stop smoking.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the study. All will take part at MD
      Anderson.
