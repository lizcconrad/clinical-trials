  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patient birthing experiences differ between the
      family-centered and traditional cesarean methods. We hypothesize that the family-centered
      cesarean method will lead to more unique and personalized cesarean birthing experiences
      without increasing the risks of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes from those documented
      with the traditional cesarean.

      Patients will be consented and randomized to one of two delivery methods by the research
      coordinator, resident physician, charge nurse or nurse on the day of their planned cesarean
      section. Several variables of interest will be collected via the electronic medical record
      and within the OR. Additionally, assessment of patient satisfaction will be conducted
      following delivery. Questions from an 11-item questionnaire will be asked of the patient by
      the study coordinator, resident physician, nurse or charge nurses.

    <description>Procedure involves lowering part of the surgical drape exposing a transparent window through which the mother can watch the birth of her baby; the baby will be placed on her chest immediately after the delivery. Cleaning and evaluation of the baby will be done by a nurse who is standing at the head of the bed.</description>

    <description>Procedure involves keeping the surgical drape up throughout the entire surgery so that the birthing process will not be visible to the mother, and the baby will be taken to the warmer to be evaluated and cleaned after birth but is available to be laid on the mother's chest at any point upon request.</description>
