      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders
      (SRBD) in clinically stable cardiologic outpatients of a German university clinic by means of
      polygraphy.

      Furthermore, the practicability of the underlying diagnostic process in clinical application
      is assessed as well as the sensitivity and specificity of polygraphy as compared to the
      reference standard of polysomnography. Another aim is to determine the individual
      cardiovascular risk profile by pulse wave analysis and risk classification according to
      European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), &quot;ESH/ESC
      risk&quot;.
