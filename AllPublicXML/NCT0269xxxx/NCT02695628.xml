  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well 18F-fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works after transcatheter arterial embolization in
      imaging tumors in patients with liver cancer. Transcatheter arterial embolization blocks
      blood flow to tumor cells by inserting tiny foreign particles into an artery near the tumor.
      [18F]FMISO is a type of radioimaging agent that binds to large molecules in tumor cells that
      have a low level of oxygen, and the radiation given off by [18F]FMISO is picked up by a PET
      scan and this may help researchers learn whether changes occur in the tumors after treatment,
      which can help decide how well the treatment worked earlier than is currently possible

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the variability of 18F FMISO uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors
      compared to normal liver after transcatheter arterial embolization by determining the
      difference in the mean of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and tumor-to-liver
      ratio (TLR) of a region of normal liver and of up to 5 index tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if areas of tumor recurrence as determined by CT or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) within a 6 month period after transcatheter arterial embolization show evidence of
      increased 18F FMISO labeling on the initial post treatment 18F FMISO PET/CT.

      II. Determine the variability in SUVmax and TLR of untreated (non embolized) HCC lesions
      compared to normal liver by determining the difference in the mean of the SUVmax and TLR of
      normal liver and tumor.

      III. Determine any toxicities related to [18F]FMISO use for PET/CT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transcatheter arterial embolization. Patients also receive
      18F-fluoromisonidazole intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scans within 4 weeks prior to
      embolization treatment and in the 20 hours following completion of treatment.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 3 months.

    <measure>Change in SUVmax and TLR of tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours prior to embolization treatment up to 20 hours following embolization</time_frame>
    <description>TLR of SUVmax will be calculated for all imaged tumors and analyzed on the logarithmic scale. A variance components model (linear mixed effects with a random intercept for subject effect) will be fitted to the TLR; in such a model the antilog of the overall intercept can be interpreted as an overall TLR averaged across tumors and subjects. Up to 5 tumors per subject will be obtained. The between subject and within subject variance components will be used to plan further studies. The overall TLR will be reported with a P value obtained from the variance components model. A P value less than 0.0</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of SUVmax and TLR of tumors with recurrence to tumors without recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Logistic regression analysis will be performed on the independent variables, SUVmax and TLR, and the dependent variable, recurrence of tumor. An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval will be obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of unanticipated toxicities related to 18F-fluoromisonidazole use over a 10 half-life period beginning from injection according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4</measure>
    <time_frame>18 hours following injection</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity rates will be calculated and reported as a proportion of number of complications/number of total treatments with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of SUVmax and TLR of untreated HCC tumor compared to normal liver, defined as any tumor that has not undergone any locoregional or systemic treatment within 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TLR of SUVmax will be calculated for all imaged tumors and analyzed on the logarithmic scale. A variance component model will be fitted to the TLR. The overall TLR will be reported with a P value obtained from the variance components model. A P value less than 0.05 will be considered significant.</description>
