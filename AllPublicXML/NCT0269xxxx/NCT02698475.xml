  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in pediatric
      participants aged greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6 through less than (&lt;) 12 years with
      moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis

      This is an open label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study staff)
      and multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study) study. The participant population will be comprised of boys and girls who
      have had a diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to first study drug
      administration and who have moderate to severe disease defined by Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index score (PASI) &gt;=12, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) &gt;=3, and Body Surface Area (BSA)
      &gt;=10 percent (%). The study consists of Screening Phase (up to 10 weeks before administration
      of the study drug), Treatment Period (Week 0 up to Week 52) and Safety follow up (Week 56).
      Participants will be primarily evaluated for efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety.
      Following completion of the Week 52 visit, participants who have had a beneficial response
      from ustekinumab treatment as determined by the investigator, and who have not yet reached
      the age of 12 years or older in countries where marketing authorization for ustekinumab has
      been granted for the treatment of psoriasis in adolescent participants (12-17 years), and are
      willing to continue ustekinumab treatment, may enter the long-term extension period (from
      Week 56 through Week 264) of the study.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is used to determine the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Overall lesions will be graded for induration scale which ranges from 0=no evidence of plaque elevation to 5=severe plaque elevation , erythema scale which ranges from 0=no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present to 5=dusky to deep red coloration, and scaling scale which ranges from 0=no evidence of scaling to 5=severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain a final PGA score (total score = 0 to 5).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve a Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=75) Percent (%) Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score (PASI) From Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index or PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. The severity of disease is calculated as follows. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u), and lower extremities (l), which account for 10%, 30%, 20% and 40% of the total Body Surface Area (BSA), respectively. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The scoring system for the signs of the disease (erythema, induration, and scaling) are: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) From Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a child's quality of life. The CDLQI, a 10-item questionnaire has 4 item response options and a recall period of 1 week. In addition to evaluating overall quality of life, the CDLQI can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment. The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater impairment in quality of life.</description>
