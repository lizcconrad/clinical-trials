    <textblock>
      Computerized tomography-guided Celiac plexus neurolysis has become a popular technique. As,
      it has Cross-section imaging system to avoids anatomic structures injury, it has high density
      resolution that clearly display the retro-peritoneal anatomic structures ,it allow an optimal
      puncture site selection and measured the angle and depth of the needle insertion accurately
      with display the range of the neurolytic agent diffusion

      The aim of this study was to evaluate analgesic efficacy of a computerized tomography guided
      left lateral antero-crural approach near the origin of celiac trunk with patients position on
      their right side immediately after the procedure using a single needle injection technique
      for upper abdominal malignancy compared with the classic 2 needle posterior antero-crural
      injection technique and possible complications.

      All patients will take thin computerized tomography section in the axial plane to detect the
      site of celiac plexus and coronal plane for correct site for needle placement.

      Computerized tomography slices thickness will be from 3 mm at 5mm interval through all the
      abdominal and lower thoracic area. The celiac and superior mesenteric arteries will be
      identified after contrast injection.

      When an ideal needle position and tip were confirmed, the stylet was removed and aspiration
      was performed to ensure that there was no blood is withdrawn.

      A volume of 3 ml of lidocaine mixed with contrast was injected to confirm the position, after
      injection another cut has been taken to show the spread of contrast freely in the
      retro-peritoneal space around the celiac plexus and the aorta. After confirmation, that
      contrast was injected to surround the artery and make sure that there was no dorsal spread to
      avoid injury to somatic nerves. Also to make sure that there was no spread to the renal
      pelvis , injection of phenol 10% mixed with contrast through needle
