  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a study to learn how to support patients aged 60+ in taking more
      breaks from sitting and reducing total sitting time. The goal of the study is to find out if
      a sitting time reduction intervention reduces sitting time compared with a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one-third of American adults over 60 have a body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2. These older
      adults have more sedentary time than any other group -- an average of 10-11 hours per day.
      Reducing the sedentary behavior of older adults with obesity, rather than only promoting more
      intensive physical activity, could provide a more feasible approach to health promotion.

      This randomized control pilot trial will evaluate a 12-week intervention to decrease sitting
      time and increase standing time and light physical activity among sedentary older adults a
      body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2 as compared to control group. Baseline and 12-week measurements
      include anthropometric measures, blood draw by finger stick, cardiovascular health
      assessments, physical function tasks, and a survey. The intervention will consist of two
      in-person visits with a health coach followed by phone-based coaching.

            <description>Participants randomly assigned to the I-STAND intervention group will receive 2 in-person health coaching sessions and 4 biweekly phone-based health coaching sessions. They will receive a wristband that gives a mild vibration after 20 minutes of inactivity and will be encouraged to stand if possible after each inactivity alert. Participants may also choose to receive biweekly email reminders in the weeks between coaching calls. They will also receive a workbook with content around reducing sitting time.
