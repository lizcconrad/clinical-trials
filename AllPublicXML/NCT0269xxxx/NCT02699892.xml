  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV post-marketing, non-interventional, open label, non-comparative and prospective
      study will examine the efficacy and safety of rituximab in participants who had previously
      received rituximab in terms of everyday medical practice. Efficacy and safety of rituximab
      will be determined 24 weeks after receiving the first infusion, 24 weeks after the second
      infusion repeated courses of treatment (if the participants receive another course of
      rituximab) and 24 weeks after the third infusion repeated courses of treatment (if the
      participants receive third course of rituximab). Protocol does not specify the criteria for
      initiation of treatment with rituximab and procedure of the infusion of rituximab. Rituximab
      will be administered at the discretion of treating physician according to approved label.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Reduction From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints Count (DAS28) of More Than 1.2 Units After 24 Weeks of First Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks after first rituximab infusion (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 score is a measure of participant's disease activity calculated using tender joint count [28 joints] (TJC28), swollen joint count [28 joints] (SJC28), participant's global assessment of disease activity (PGH) [visual analog scale (VAS): 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 was calculated according to following formula: [0.56 multiplied by (*) square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28*√SJC]+[0.70*the natural logarithm (ln) ESR]+[0.014*PGH]. Total possible score of 0 to approximately 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. Scores below 2.6 indicated clinical remission, score of less than or equals to (&lt;/=) 3.2 indicated low disease activity, score of greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 indicated moderate disease activity, scores above 5.1 indicated high or severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, 48 and 72</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was assessed according to EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria, which defined clinically meaningful improvement at Weeks 24, 48, and 72. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in DAS28 score and on actual DAS28 score, at Weeks 24, 48, and 72. DAS28 score: participant's disease activity calculated using TJC28, SJC28, PGH [VAS: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and ESR. DAS28 was calculated by following formula: (0.56*√TJC)+(0.28*√SJC)+(0.70*ln ESR)+(0.014*PGH). Total possible score = 0-10, higher scores represented higher disease activity. EULAR Good response: DAS28&lt;/=3.2; reduction of DAS28 &gt;1.2.</description>

        <description>DAS28 score is a measure of participant’s disease activity calculated using tender joint count [28 joints] (TJC28), swollen joint count [28 joints] (SJC28), participant’s global assessment of disease activity (PGH) [visual analog scale (VAS): 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 was calculated according to following formula: [0.56 multiplied by (*) square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28*√SJC]+[0.70*the natural logarithm (ln) ESR]+[0.014*PGH]. Total possible score of 0 to approximately 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. Scores below 2.6 indicated clinical remission, score of less than or equals to (&lt;/=) 3.2 indicated low disease activity, score of greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 indicated moderate disease activity, scores above 5.1 indicated high or severe disease.</description>
