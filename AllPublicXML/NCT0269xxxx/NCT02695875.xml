  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a disease whose incidence rate is increasing and causing a severe disability
      to those who suffer it. Currently, other treatment resources are being implemented, such as
      aquatic therapy. This therapy seems to provide positive results in different dimensions of
      fibromyalgia.

      The main objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a physical therapy
      program in warm water vs. land-based therapy in women with fibromyalgia for pain reduction
      and improvement balance at the end of treatment and a month and a half later (follow-up).

      The type of study is a randomized controlled opened trial. The sample is composed of 34 women
      with age between 35 and 64 years and fibromyalgia diagnosis who will be divided into 2
      groups: Aquatic Therapy Group (n=17) and Land-Based Therapy Group (n=17). This study will
      have two primary outcomes: Pain and balance. The intensity of pain will be assessed using the
      visual analog scale (VAS) and the pain threshold for each one of the 18 tender points will be
      assessed using a electronic algometer. Static balance will be evaluated with the Romberg's
      test and the dynamic balance with the Timed Up &amp; Go test (TUG) and Berg Balance Scale. Both
      type of balance will be recorded in slow motion and then, will be analysed with a motion
      software. Secondary outcomes are: The impact of fibromyalgia on patient's lives, that will be
      measured with the &quot;Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire&quot; (FIQR); the sleep quality, that
      will be assessed with the &quot;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&quot; (PSQI); the fatigue, that will be
      evaluated witn the &quot;Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory&quot; (MFI); the physical capacity, that
      will be measured with the &quot;six minute walk test&quot; (SMWT) and confidence in balance that will
      be assessed with the &quot;Activities-specific Balance Confidence&quot; scale (ABC).

      Each intervention will last one hour and will be made 3 times a week for three months . It
      will consist of 4 sections: Warming, exercises for static and dynamic balance training,
      stretching and relaxation. Statistical analysis will be made using the Statistical Package
      for the Social Sciences software, version 21.0 for Windows. p ≤ 0.05 will be the significance
      level set for all analysis.

    <description>Aquatic therapy is the experimental group. This therapy will take place in a warm pool which is located in Rialta's Sports Complex. Aquatic therapy session will be conducted by the main researcher with the help of an assistant. Because the number of patients (n=17), they will be subdivided into two subgroups of 8 and 9 people respectively in order to ensure the safety and care of patients. The intervention will last for one hour: Warming (15 minutes); exercises to train the static and dynamic balance (25 minutes); stretching (10 minutes); relaxation (10 minutes). Over 12 weeks of treatment, difficulty in performing exercises to train balance will increase progressively.</description>
