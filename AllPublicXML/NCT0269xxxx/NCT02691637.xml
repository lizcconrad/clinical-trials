  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been associated with a development of atrophic
      gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori related atrophic gastritis and intestinal
      metaplasia have been regarded as pre-malignant lesion. However, the role of H. pylori
      eradication treatment in the reversibility of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia
      has not been clearly defined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      relationship between H. pylori eradication and the reversibility of atrophic gastritis and
      intestinal metaplasia in Korean patients.

      It is a prospective, case-control study to compare the status of atrophic gastritis and
      intestinal metaplasia from the patients who undergo H. pylori eradication treatment or not.
      After enrollment, each patient will be receive annual surveillance upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy. The present investigators will monitor the status of atrophic gastritis and
      intestinal metaplasia annually and finally compare the reversibility of them.

    <description>The improvement of Atrophic Gastritis and Intestinal metaplasia was defined as improvement of score compared with baseline.
The histological features of the gastric mucosa were recorded using updated Sydney system scores, that is, 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = marked.(Am J Surg Pathol 1996;20:1161-81.) Outcome measure will be done annually (per 1 year), final follow-up is 2019</description>
