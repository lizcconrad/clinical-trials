    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to identify predictors of success in the treatment of obesity
      after roux-en-y bariatric surgery. The specific aims of this proposal are to:

        1. employ behavioral tests of mechanisms that control food intake in normal weight
           individuals, to determine which intake control mechanisms lead to changes after
           Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGBP); and

        2. measure behavioral and psycho-social predictors of weight loss and food intake
           reduction, so as to determine which are most predictive of successful weight loss and
           food intake reduction.

      The mechanism investigators propose to account for success is reduction in food intake
      brought about by the pattern of hormone release, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1), and gastric distention, both known to underlie satiation, coupled with
      post-ingestive changes in reinforcing value of food and motivation to consume. Tests of the
      hypothesis will be done by measuring responses to tasting, working for, and consuming, foods
      on sensory, motivational, cognitive, and physiological variables, including amount consumed
      and rate of eating under standardized conditions, before surgery and at a two year follow up
      visit. In addition the inhibitor exendin-9-39 (EX9) will be infused before a meal to
      determine whether blockade of GLP-1 Receptor after surgery partially reverses intake
      reduction. Investigators predict that successful patients will show changes that favor
      reduction in food intake, rate of eating, motivation to consume, reward value of foods, and a
      hormone profile that has been shown to generate satiation and maintain reduction in intake
      (e.g. increased Cholecystokinin (CCK), GLP-1, reduced ghrelin). To the extent that
      psycho-social and cognitive factors may override physiological brakes to eating behavior, the
      subjects may fail to achieve success, and consequently the failure may be predicted from
      over-impulsiveness or inability to suppress working for rewarding food stimuli. To test these
      hypotheses, a total of 50 patients will be enrolled prior to RYGBP and restudied 2 years
      after the surgery. Based on known high attrition in this population and our past 10 year
      experience with bariatric research, it is estimated that 100 patients will need to be
      enrolled over 2 years to obtain 50 who complete testing at 2 years. EX9 studies will be done
      in a subset of 30 completers, only after roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGBP), 15 failure (&lt;15%
      weight loss) 15 success ( &gt;30% weight loss).

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health as well as economic (expense of treating) problem
      world-wide, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) surgeries are
      effective treatments. A barrier to progress is that between 25% and 40% patients were not
      successful in achieving and maintaining at least 30% weight loss, which is considered
      medically successful for this operation. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to
      success or failure of this operation is an unsolved problem in obesity research which this
      proposal is addressing. The focus of this project is to identify mechanisms that contribute
      to suppression of food intake following bariatric surgery, and to investigate whether these
      mechanisms predict long term success following bariatric surgery
