      This research study examines the feasibility of using an in-vehicle mobile technology
      monitoring system to measure teen secondary task engagement during on-road driving as the
      outcome measure for a web-based intervention to prevent risky driving in novice teen drivers.

      This research study examines the feasibility of using an in-vehicle mobile technology
      monitoring system to measure teen secondary task engagement during on-road driving as the
      outcome measure for a web-based intervention to prevent risky driving in novice teen drivers.
      Approximately 20 teens who have been licensed for less than 90 days will be enrolled and
      evaluated at baseline, ~1 week and ~4 weeks. Participants will complete an intervention after
      the ~1 week assessment. This study will provide information on the feasibility of the
      web-based intervention to prevent risky driving and estimation of effect size of the
      intervention on cell phone use while driving.
