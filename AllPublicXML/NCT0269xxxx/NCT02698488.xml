    <textblock>
      Identification of the embryo with the highest potential to implant and establish an ongoing
      pregnancy is a primary aim in human assisted reproduction. This task is undertaken every day
      by embryologists worldwide during the treatment of couples that wish to conceive by IVF. The
      optimal scenario is the transfer of a single embryo which gives rise to a singleton
      pregnancy. The current limitations in determination of embryos that have the highest
      implantation potential probably contribute to the low rates of pregnancy during IVF
      treatments. Hence, since the beginning of IVF, how to improve embryo selection has been a
      'hot research topic.' Morphology has been a very obvious parameter to assess embryos as it
      provides a chance to evaluate them from the oocyte stage all the way to the blastocysts
      stage. Hence, in the first era of IVF, there were number of studies that evaluated this
      parameter and associated morphology with IVF success rates. On the other hand, it has been
      previously stated that the slight increase in pregnancy rates during IVF treatment is mostly
      likely a result of better practices in laboratory than morphological evaluation. Due to the
      limitations of morphological evaluation, several researchers have investigated adjunctive
      non-invasive approaches for the assessment of the embryo, such as the metabolomic profiling.

      Recently mass spectroscopic (MS) approaches have been utilized in limited settings. Samples
      needed minimal preparation; analytical analysis was rapid and large amounts of data was
      available. Hence, MS might be a promising approach for metabolomic profiling of embryo
      culture media.

    <description>Embryos will be morphologically evaluated according to the number and regularity of blastomeres and fragmentation degree. Only embryo culture media of good quality embryos (embryos with ≥6 cells with no fragmentation) will be included in the study. After dilution, embryo culture media will be analyzed by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-QTOF) MS. The spectra will be collected in the negative ion mode. Abundance of ions in each spectrum will be further analyzed.</description>
