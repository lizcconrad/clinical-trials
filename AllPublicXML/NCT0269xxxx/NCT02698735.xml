  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable, devastating, inherited
      skin disease for which there is only supportive care. RDEB is due to mutations in COL7A1 gene
      that encodes for type VII collagen (C7), the major component of anchoring fibrils (AFs)
      mediating epidermal-dermal adherence. Approximately 20% of COL7A1 mutations are nonsense
      mutations leading to premature stop codons and a truncated C7 with diminished function. The
      investigators demonstrated that aminoglycosides such as gentamicin readily induce premature
      termination codon (PTC) &quot;read through&quot; and produce biologically functional C7 in 22 reported
      COL7A1 nonsense mutations. Importantly, aminoglycoside-induced C7 reversed the abnormal RDEB
      cell phenotype and incorporated into the dermal-epidermal junction. Herein, the investigators
      propose the first clinical trial of gentamicin (topical and intradermal) in RDEB patients
      with nonsense mutations that the investigators have fully characterized. The milestones
      include increased C7 and AFs at the patients' dermal-epidermal junction, improved RDEB
      Disease Activity Score, and absence of significant gentamicin side effects.
