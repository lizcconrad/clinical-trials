      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injection of autologous fat or
      hyaluronic-acid injections in temporal region are effective in the treatment of temporal
      hollowing after lateral wall decompression in patients with thyroid eye disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grave's disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. Thyroid eye disease is
      affecting nearly 50% of patients with Grave's disease. Surgical treatment may address several
      of the manifestations, including the increased volume of the orbital contents. Decompression
      of the orbit can be achieved by removing the lateral orbital walls; &quot;lateral wall
      decompression&quot;.

      In a retrospective study at the Department of Ophthalmology, Haukeland University Hospital,
      about half of the patients had a disfiguring hollowing in the temporal region after lateral
      wall decompression. The patient reported outcome of the procedure is clearly an indication
      for further esthetic treatment. However, until now the treatment option for these patients
      have been limited, or simply neglected. The investigators have contacted over 40 patients
      with this complication that want treatment.

      In this project the investigators will treat bilateral hollowing with injection of autologous
      fat in one temporal region and hyaluronic-acid injections on the opposite side. Participants
      with unilateral hollowing will be randomized to one of the treatment options. Outcomes will
      be evaluated by clinical examination, photographs and ultrasound volume measurement at 6, 12,
      18 and 24 months postoperatively. The participants will be retreated at these follow up
      intervals if necessary.

      The project will be an interventional, prospective follow-up study and is approved by the
      regional ethics committee. The study will be the first of its kind to date as the
      investigators will be able to prospectively evaluate the effect of autologous fat injections
      to hyaluronic-acid injections in the same patient for the same condition.
