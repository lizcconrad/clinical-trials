  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how blood serum handling conditions can affect the concentrations of
      ~1,000 serum metabolites and attempts to quantify the degree of attenuation and/or potential
      bias in epidemiologic associations that may result from less than optimal sample handling
      conditions.

      Metabolomics, the simultaneous quantification of concentrations of hundreds or thousands of
      metabolites simultaneously in a biological matrix, is a versatile analytical technique
      capable of accelerating biomarker-based discoveries in nutritional science. Recently,
      metabolomics has been applied to samples collected in feeding studies (1) and epidemiologic
      studies (2) to identify dozens of novel potential dietary biomarkers. Several large
      prospective cohort studies, many of which are collaborating in a metabolomics consortium led
      by the National Cancer Institute, have recently applied metabolomics to banked samples. This
      has made nutrition-related biomarkers suddenly available for tens of thousands of
      participants with follow-up for disease endpoints, enabling truly large-scale nutritional
      biomarkers and disease studies.

        Men and women will be recruited from the area surrounding the BHNRC. There are several
        thousand government and privately employed workers located within a 10-mile radius of the
        BHNRC and several residential communities from which a cohort of volunteers will be
        recruited. The population includes an ethnically diverse group of subjects.
