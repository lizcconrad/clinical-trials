  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase II, single arm, open-label, interventional trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic malignant peripheral
      nerve sheath tumour (MPNST).

      The patients will be treated with pembrolizumab for up to 10 cycles.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the percentage of patients with curatively unresectable
      MPNST who have achieved clinical response; complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or
      stable disease (SD) at 18 weeks as assessed by the Investigator, by using RECIST, v1.1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MPNST, who are not eligible for surgery of curative intent, will be considered
      for treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients will receive pembrolizumab treatment for up to 10
      cycles. The patients must discontinue study treatment earlier (before 10 cycles of
      pembrolizumab) if they experience symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity related to pembrolizumab, any medical condition that may
      jeopardize the patient's safety, use of other non-protocol anti-cancer therapy or pregnancy.

      Patients who have received 10 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.

      Patients who have achieved a clinical meaningful response after 10 cycles of pembrolizumab,
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if
      progression is detected after cycle 10.

      Due to the low incidence of MPNST, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a Simon's
      two-stage design is suggested (see Statistical Analysis Plans - Section 8.0).

      Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be performed after the first 7 patient
      has been treated for 18 weeks: In case of no responders; the trial ends. If one or more
      responders, the trial will continue into stage two to a total number of 18 patients will be
      included.

             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
