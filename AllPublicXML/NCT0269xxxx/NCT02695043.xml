      The primary purpose of this research is to increase adherence to outpatient rehabilitation of
      chronically underserved individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The intervention will
      be a TBI rehabilitation-focused education tool suitable for use with a wide variety of
      patients, including those with poor literacy skills and those with Limited English
      Proficiency (LEP), hereafter referred to as the Multimedia Multicultural Educational Program
      for TBI (MMEPT).
