      The present study is based on hypotheses that some as yet unknown genetic factors may result
      in recurrent miscarriage (RM). Consequently, the main aim of this study was to gain new
      information about the underlying genetic causes of RM in the Egyptian population and to
      investigate the expression of ERK and p-ERK protein in human placenta and their corresponding
      tissue, to assess the significance of MAPK signal pathway in progression of recurrent
      miscarriage and PI3K-Akt Pathway.
