  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, it is estimated that there are approximately 630,000 patients who have
      ESRD with two-thirds of those patients subsequently receiving maintenance dialysis. Studies
      have demonstrated that the initiation and timing of dialysis for those with ESRD seem to vary
      widely regionally - confirming the uncertainty of the benefits of chronic dialysis in this
      population

      Pre-dialysis education programs inform patients of all of their options allowing them to
      choose renal replacement therapy that is most consistent with their wishes. Recent evidence
      has supported using different methods of delivering education including videos to complement
      standard clinical care practices to promote informed decision making. This proposed study
      will serve to examine the effectiveness of a dialysis modality video decision support tool to
      inform chronic kidney disease patients of different dialytic and non-dialytic therapies.
