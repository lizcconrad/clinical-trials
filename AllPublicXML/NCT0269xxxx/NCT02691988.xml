  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Because long-term use of ICS is associated with an increased likelihood of
      side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia and loss of bone density, it is important to
      limit prescription of ICS to patients who have a clear indication for this treatment. In
      addition, avoiding unnecessary treatment with ICS could reduce the burden that chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) puts on healthcare budgets. The recently updated COPD
      guideline of the Dutch college of General Practitioners (NHG) emphasizes the importance of
      optimizing medical treatment for COPD patients with only limited room for the use of inhaled
      corticosteroids.

      Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate whether discontinuation of inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) for patients without a clear indication for ICS according to current
      guidelines results in a reduction of ICS use without adverse health effects for the patients
      involved.

      Study design: The study is a pragmatic, clustered, parallel group, non-inferiority trial in
      Dutch general practices with a follow-up of 26 weeks per patient.

      Study population: 620 COPD patients with confirmed chronic airflow obstruction, aged â‰¥ 40 yrs
      who use ICS for at least the prior 6 months without a clear indication.

      Intervention (if applicable): Guided ICS withdrawal in optimised COPD management. All study
      participants (of both study arms) will receive recommendations on optimal bronchodilator
      therapy and a personalized action plan to recognize symptom deterioration in an early stage.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Number of exacerbation-free weeks. Secondary study
      parameters: successful cessation of ICS, time to first exacerbation, number of moderate and
      severe exacerbations, health-related quality of life, health status, and pneumonias.
      Moreover, information on the process of care and costs will be collected.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Many COPD patients use ICS without a clear indication. Long-term use of ICS is
      associated with an increased likelihood of side-effects such as increased risk of pneumonia
      and loss of bone density and should be avoided in those who do not benefit from it. However,
      there is a small subgroup of COPD patients that have reduced numbers of exacerbations because
      of their ICS use and it is impossible to identify a priori the patients who this applies too.
      Therefore, it is important that the ICS discontinuation is guided to detect potential
      deteriorations early on.

    <description>A moderate exacerbation is defined as prescription of a course of oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics related to deterioration of COPD registered as episodes in the electronic patient record. A severe exacerbation is defined as a COPD-related ER visit and/or unscheduled COPD-related hospital admission.</description>

    <description>Health status will be measured using the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) which has been developed as a COPD specific health status measurement. CCQ questionnaires that are filled out at the start (t=0) and end of the study period (t = 26 weeks) will be used to evaluate the difference in change in CCQ score between the intervention and control groups.</description>
