  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well arsenic trioxide and itraconazole work in treating
      patients with basal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic
      trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Itraconazole may
      help treat fungal infections in patients with basal cell cancer. Giving arsenic trioxide with
      itraconazole may work better in treating basal cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response of arsenic trioxide/itraconazole in patients with refractory
      basal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if this treatment is associated with a reduction in Gli messenger ribonucleic
      acid (mRNA) levels in tumor and/or normal skin biopsy samples, when compared to baseline
      levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally (PO) and itraconazole PO daily for 50 days, followed
      by maintenance therapy consisting of 2 weeks off treatment and then 2 weeks on treatment for
      up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
