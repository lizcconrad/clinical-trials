  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ReDy™ System (Renal Dynamics) is a renal denervation device incorporating a variety of
      ablation features and technical improvements over previously designed systems into a single
      product. It is intended to treat uncontrolled (drug-resistant) hypertension by RF ablation of
      the sympathetic nerve network surrounding the renal arteries.

      This study will be carried out to validate the safety and the efficacy of the ReDy™ Renal
      Denervation device and to demonstrate that it performs according to its intended use, i.e.
      the treatment of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

         15. Any medical condition as estimated by the Study Investigator that may harm patient or
             jeopardize study participation, the interpretation of study results or may impede the
