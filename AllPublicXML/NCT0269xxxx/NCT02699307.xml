  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is the cornerstone of good diabetes management, and yet effective physical
      activity intervention is not available. The investigators developed a lifestyle intervention
      based on individual's home activity patterns. The goal of the study is to test the efficacy
      of this intervention among older adults with diabetes. In addition to physical activity, the
      investigators will also assess if the intervention will improve social participation.

      To tailor to the needs of older adults, the investigators developed an innovative lifestyle
      modification intervention that incorporates rehabilitation approaches to improve the
      participation of physical activities (PA) among sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes.
      The intervention is developed based on well-established health behavior theory (i.e.,
      self-regulation) and the conceptual framework from the World Health Organization, with
      several innovations not previously investigated in this population. The intervention:

        1. is tailored based on individual's unique patterns of daily PA performed within his/her
           environment as opposed to the total amount of PA performed in a day or a recall of
           activities over some time period;

        2. uses an accelerometer-assisted, field-based method to address the individual's unique
           physical and social environment;

        3. is delivered by a trained occupational therapist in brief counseling sessions, which can
           be easily translated into real clinical settings; and

        4. addresses participation, a patient-centered outcome that is associated with quality of
           life but has received limited attention outside of rehabilitation research.
