  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical manifestations of rotator cuff tear include shoulder pain, weakness, and stiffness.
      The level of pain is often a limiting factor when assessing shoulder range of motion and
      strength pre-operatively. Pain itself has even been a cause of weakness due to muscle
      atrophy.

      The purpose of this study is to further understand the effect pain has by measuring constant
      shoulder scores in patients before and after ultrasound guided subacromial (the outer end of
      the shoulder blade) injection of lidocaine (a local anesthetic or numbing agent) compared to
      saline (salt solution), in patients indicated for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The
      saline and lidocaine has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA). The constant shoulder score includes your level of pain, activity level, range of
      motion and strength measures.
