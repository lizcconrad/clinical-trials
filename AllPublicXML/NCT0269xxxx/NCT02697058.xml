      Study Part 1: To assess the safety and tolerability, and to characterize the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of BAX2398 in combination with 5-FU/calcium levofolinate in Japanese patients.

      Study Part 2: To compare the efficacy of BAX2398 in combination with 5-FU/calcium
      levofolinate versus 5-FU/calcium levofolinate as assessed by Progression Free Survival (PFS)
      using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

    <description>The EORTC-QLQC30 is a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life of cancer patients in multicultural clinical research settings. It incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures are also included. All scales and single-item measures range=0 to 100. High score for a functional scale=high/healthy level of functioning. High score for global health status/QoL=high QoL. High score for symptom scale/single item=high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

         10. Participant has been exposed to an investigational product (IP) within 30 days prior
             to the first dose of the study drug or is scheduled to participate in another clinical
