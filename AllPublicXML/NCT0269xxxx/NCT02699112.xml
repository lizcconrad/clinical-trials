      To assess patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure using echocardiography,cardiac output
      measurements and markers of neural respiratory drive (EMGpara) prior to, during and after
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) initiation, and to follow the patients for 3 months. The
      investigators hypothesize that the improvement in cardiac function and/or respiratory
      mechanics over time are associated with ongoing improvements in oxygenation, quality of life
      and exercise capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is characterized by the incapacity of the respiratory system to maintain
      the normal arterial blood gas homeostasis. Specifically, the overlap of hypoxaemia and
      hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6 kPa) is referred to as Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure (HRF). HRF is
      one of the most common causes for hospital admission with high re-admission rates, therefore
      constitute a major burden on healthcare systems. Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is a well
      established treatment in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who frequently suffer
      with associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). NIV helps to increase arterial oxygenation and
      reduces hypercapnia. It is used in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure caused by
      Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS). The associated degree of PH can lead to an increased
      afterload of the right ventricle (RV) that causes progressive remodelling of the right heart.
      RV dysfunction is correlated with a reduced long term prognosis in respiratory conditions. In
      literature NIV is shown as effective method to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in
      OHS.

      It has not been described how NIV impacts on cardiac function and NRD in OHS.
