    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the short term and long term effects of ketogenic
      diets on measures of cardiovascular health. Such measures include cholesterol levels, blood
      pressure, weight, and thickening of the blood vessel wall over time. Adults aged 18 or older
      who are already on a ketogenic diet for at least 12 months or who are interested in beginning
      on the modified Atkins diet may join.

      If participants agree to be in this study, the investigators will ask the participants to do
      the following things:

      At Initial enrollment for both longterm ketogenic diet and new modified Atkins diet
      participants

        -  Review of calendars (showing seizures) and 3-day food record

        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference

        -  Standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs will be drawn as well as levels of low density
           lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1

        -  Participant will receive a high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries in the
           neck performed either the day of enrollment or within 1 month of enrollment

      At follow-up clinic visits (month 3 and month 6) for new modified Atkins diet participants

        -  Review of calendars and food records

        -  Labs repeated - standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs as well as levels of low
           density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1

        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference

      At follow-up clinic visits (month 12 and month 24) for new modified Atkins diet participants

        -  Review of calendars and food records

        -  Labs repeated - standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs as well as levels of low
           density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1

        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference

        -  Participants will receive a high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries in the
           neck performed either the day of follow-up or within 1 month of follow-up
