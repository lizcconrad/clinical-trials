    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to look at differences in responsiveness to the subcutaneous
      injection of a standardized dose of rapid-acting insulin analog and blood glucose variability
      during different phases of the menstrual cycle in females with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease that leads to disability and premature death if
      not well treated. While females and males are equally affected by T1D, diabetes places
      additional burdens of care on females. Characteristically, females with T1D have worse
      glycemic control, a higher incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis, and a greater risk of
      cardiovascular complications as compared to their male peers. It has been hypothesized that
      variations in responsiveness to pre-meal bolus doses of insulin during menstrual cycling is
      an important underlying cause for increased management problems in females with T1D, but the
      hypothesis has not been adequately tested. Consequently, insulin treatment of females during
      the different cycles of menstruation remains a guessing game that often results in major
      swings in blood glucose from high to low levels. The unfavorable impact of this gap in
      knowledge extends to the efficiency and accuracy of artificial pancreas closed-loop (CL)
      system insulin delivery algorithms designed based on insulin action parameters. The proposed
      study addresses this unmet need in diabetes management for females both in open-loop (OL) and
      CL therapies.

    <description>The insulin glucodynamic action will be measured by the amount of dextrose infused during the study as previously described by DeFronzo. The primary outcome measure for the euglycemic clamp studies will be area under the glucose infusion rate (AUCGIR) that will be compared between luteal and follicular phases of menstrual cycle.</description>

    <description>During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, subjects will go through an insulin time action (clamp) study. Subjects are injected a bolus dose of insulin and blood sugar levels are kept within a 90-100mg/dL range by intravenous fluid infusion during fasting state. GIR stands for the glucose infusion rate that is measured in mg/kg/minute, indicating the amount of glucose delivered per minute per kilogram of body mass.</description>
