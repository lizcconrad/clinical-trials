    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand variation in the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
      This study uses an iPhone app to record these symptoms through questionnaires and sensors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Living with Parkinson disease means coping with symptoms that change every day. Yet these
      changes are not tracked frequently enough. Most people with Parkinson disease see a clinician
      only once or twice a year. This study measures changes in Parkinson disease symptoms in real
      time using an app. The app remotely monitors Parkinson disease symptoms using surveys and the
      sensors on mobile devices. This study may contribute to increasing our understanding of the
      variability in Parkinson disease symptoms. This knowledge could be used to improve quality of
      life for people living with Parkinson disease.

      <doc_url>http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201611</doc_url>
      <doc_comment>Here we present data from mPower, a clinical observational study about Parkinson disease conducted purely through an iPhone app interface. The study interrogated aspects of this movement disorder through surveys and frequent sensor-based recordings from participants with and without Parkinson disease. Benefitting from large enrollment and repeated measurements on many individuals, these data may help establish baseline variability of real-world activity measurement collected via mobile phones, and ultimately may lead to quantification of the ebbs-and-flows of Parkinson symptoms. App source code for these data collection modules are available through an open source license for use in studies of other conditions. We hope that releasing data contributed by engaged research participants will seed a new community of analysts working collaboratively on understanding mobile health data to advance human health.</doc_comment>
