      Objective: To evaluate the effect of Iron supplement with two different amounts (one in the
      higher limit and another in the lower limit of the suggested amount) according to the
      presence of mutations in the HFE gene in the physical, immune and neurobehavioral development
      in the 6 to 12 moth toddlers.

      Methodology: Subjects: 340 toddlers coming from Paediatric Serves of Sant Joan Hospital.
      Methods: At 6 and 12 months it done clinical history, food registry, biochemist
      determinations: haemoglobin, iron, transferrin, ferritin, reactive C protein and immune
      response (IL4, IL10, IL6 IFN, IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE). Mutations in the HFE gene: C282Y, H63D,
      S65D and hepcidin gene. Mental, psychomotor and behavioual development (Bayley Scales of
      Infant Development 2on Edition: 1993). We evaluate the level of language and communication
      (MacArthur), regulation and sensory process (Infant Toddler Symptom Checklist), familiar and
      environment surroundings (Scale Health General Parental Stress Index).

      Design: Randomised Clinical Trial with two groups of intervention. Group A received high-iron
      fortified milk (1.2mg/100mL) and Group B received low-iron fortified milk (0.4mg/100mL).

      Inclusion criteria: caucasian new-borns, term infants.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Families that refuse enter at the follow-up.

        -  Low-birth weight or preterm infants.

        -  Anaemic infants.

        -  Infants with congenital defects, immunodeficiency or hypothyroidism.
