      The purpose of the present study was to measure the effect of proprioceptive training,
      short-term, on dynamic postural balance during pregnancy and after 8 weeks of follow-up.

      Thirty-nine pregnant women were randomized to either the intervention group(n=20) , which
      would perform proprioceptive exercise, or the control group(n=19, no intervention) .

      Improvement in the postural balance of pregnant women may be the improvement in joint
      mechanoreceptor activation present in the joint capsules, medial ligament, posterior cruciate
      ligament, and meniscus, which result in improved articular stabilization and, consequently, a
      possible increase in the musculature's ability to provide co-contraction.

      Improved their postural control after the intervention may have been due to central and
      peripheral nervous system balance control circuits and strength gains, which showed
      improvements extending from the second to the third trimester . The maintenance of postural
      balance requires the integration of the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems.

      At the spinal level, first level of motor control, nervous reflex movement patterns are
      received from higher levels of the nervous system. This provides for reflex splinting during
      conditions of abnormal stress about the joint and has significant implications for
      rehabilitation.The muscle spindles play a major role in the control of muscular movement by
      adjusting activity in the lower motor neurons.

      The second level of motor control is the brain stem, where the joint afferent is relayed to
      maintain the posture and balance of the body. Information delivered to the brain stem
      emanates from the joint proprioceptors, the vestibular centers in the ears, and the eyes.The
      final aspect of motor control includes the highest level of CNS function (motor cortex, basal
      ganglia, and cerebellum)and is mediated by cognitive awareness of body position and movement.
      Movements that are repeated can be stored as central commands, and can be performed without
      continuous reference to consciousness. This better joint afferent between the peripheral and
      central nervous system control may be reflected in the improvement of balance during
      pregnancy, as observed in this study as a result of proprioceptive training delivered to
      pregnant women.
