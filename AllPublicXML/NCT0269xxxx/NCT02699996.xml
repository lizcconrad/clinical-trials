  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized pilot trial studies peer mentoring to see how well it works in
      promoting follow-up care self-management in younger childhood cancer survivors. Childhood
      cancer survivors require lifelong follow-up care to identify, monitor, and treat medical and
      psychosocial late effects stemming from their cancer, its treatment, and lifestyle factors. A
      peer mentoring program may improve disease knowledge, health motivation, problem-solving
      skills, stress management, and communication with caregivers and providers in adolescent and
      young adult cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adapt problem-solving skills training (PSST) with peer mentoring to improve adolescent and
      young adult (AYA) self-management of long-term follow-up care.

      II. Evaluate the feasibility of the self-management + peer mentoring program in a pilot
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      III. Assess preliminary efficacy of the peer mentoring program vs. widely available print
      brochure.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE 1: Participants (providers, survivors, and caregivers) complete a 60 minute interview
      to help adapt PSST to focus on AYA self-management of care.

      PHASE 2: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients complete the adapted PSST peer mentoring intervention comprising a
      videoconference or phone call with the peer mentor followed by secure text messaging weekly
      for 4 weeks and then monthly for 2 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive tailored survivorship educational materials from the Children's
      Oncology Group patient education &quot;Health Links&quot; as well as a brochure with self-management
      strategies entitled: &quot;Moving Into Adult Health Care: A Guide for Young Adults With and
      Without Disabilities&quot; via email or postal mail. Patients also receive general health tips
      (e.g., exercise and nutrition recommendations) via text message weekly for 4 weeks and then
      monthly for 2 months.
