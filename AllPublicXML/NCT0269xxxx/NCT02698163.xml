  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-surgical root canal therapy (RCT) represents a standard of treatment that addresses
      infected pulp tissue in teeth and protects against future infection while preserving the
      tooth for the patient for mainly cosmetic purposes. RCT is offered as the better cosmetic,
      cheaper, and less time intensive treatment option for a patient compared to those of dental
      implantation. Dental implantation is the alternative to RCT, and they are both originally
      offered at the time of the initial consultation. RCT involves non-surgically removing dental
      pulp comprising blood vessels and nerve tissue, decontaminating residually infected tissue,
      and using a filler material to replace the non-surgically created space where the pulp was
      removed. Currently, standard of care treatment for RCT utilizes gutta-percha as the root
      canal filling material. Our research group has previously demonstrated NDGP's improvement in
      tensile strength compared to those of gutta-percha. This research studies a new type of
      filler, gutta-percha modified by the addition of nanodiamond material (NDGP). This is an
      equivalence study of NDGP and standard gutta-percha administration.

    <description>For all the patients in the control arm of the study, standard treatment of care procedures will be given. Root canal therapy will be given according to the vertical obturation technique. The root canals will be filled with standard root canal filler material: gutta percha at the apical third up to and including the coronal third. The tooth will be restored with a crown for posterior teeth, or a composite filling for anterior teeth.</description>

    <description>For all the patients in the treatment arm of the study, standard treatment of care procedures will be given. Root canal therapy will be given according to the vertical obturation technique. The difference between the two arms will be the root canal filler material used. The root canals for the treatment arm of the study will be filled with gutta percha at the apical third, Nanodiamond gutta percha (NDGP) in the middle third, and again with gutta percha at the coronal third. The tooth will be restored with a crown for posterior teeth, or a composite filling for anterior teeth.</description>

    <description>Gutta percha is a device made from coagulated sap of certain tropical trees intended to fill the root canal of a tooth. The gutta percha is softened by heat and inserted into the root canal, where it hardens as it cools. Gutta percha is classified as Class I (general controls).</description>
