  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of Buddhify relaxation therapy in reducing the
      stress and anxiety levels of patients. The secondary aim is to investigate the effect of
      prior stress and anxiety levels on the perceived pain level of undergoing a medical
      procedure, reported post-procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Undergoing medical procedures is reported to cause stress and anxiety among many
      individuals.This can trigger the sympathetic nervous response, including decreased skin
      temperature, increased pulse, and increased blood pressure. While evolutionary advantageous,
      this response has deleterious effects on the healing process. Heightened stress levels can
      also trigger an increased release of cortisol, a naturally produced steroid hormone known to
      hinder the immune response. In response to high levels of stress, a patient's tolerance for
      pain decreases and the perceived pain level increases.

      Relaxation techniques can assist in reducing the stress and anxiety levels of a patient,
      which allows for lower perceived pain and more rapid healing. Many relaxation techniques
      exist, including acupuncture, child life intervention, breathing therapy and guided imagery.
      Buddhify, a mobile application, incorporates breathing therapy and audio-guided imagery into
      brief relaxation sessions, with the goal of reducing the stress and anxiety levels of the
      user. This application presents a convenient option for patients to use prior to undergoing a
      procedure. If proven to be effective, this application could be more widely used to help
      reduce the stress level, anxiety level and subsequent perceived pain level of patients,
      ultimately improving their healing reaction.
