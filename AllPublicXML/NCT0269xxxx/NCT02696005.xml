    <textblock>
      30 patients suffering from Heart Failure with Ejection Fraction less than 40% start Cardiac
      Rehabilitation Programme, serum KLOTHO Hormone level and other labs and Echo measurements
      will be taken on the first visit.

      After completion of 3-month Rehabilitation Programme the second set of labs and Echo
      measurements will be taken.

      Than participants will be divided for 2 groups: the patients who wish to continue
      Rehabilitation programme for additional 3-month period and the second group that prefer to
      stop Rehabilitation programme after completion of the first 3 month period.

      For both groups additional set of labs will be taken this time and at the end of the study.

      The Aim of the study: to investigate association between serum KLOTHO level, physical
      activity and possible correlation with laboratory and echocardiographic parameters in cohort
      of Heart Failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients, age range older than 18 years old suffering from Heart Failure, Functional
      capacity II-III and echocardiographic evidence of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction less
      than 40% beginning Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme. Following recruitment of patients to the
      study each one will undergo serum KLOTHO Hormone level assessment along with kidney
      functions, N terminal -Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide hormone activity and Echo measurements
      .

      After completion of 3-months Exercise based Rehabilitation Programme set at 70-80% of maximal
      individual exercise capacity,a second identical set of lab tests and Echo measurements will
      be performed.

      After than participants will be divided into 2 groups: Group I will comprise patients who
      wish to continue Rehabilitation programme for additional 3-months period and the Group II
      those who will stop Exercise Rehabilitation programme following completion of the first 3
      months.

      Both groups will undergo additional set of lab tests at this six-months-point. Except for the
      primary and secondary end-points all possible correlations between serum KLOTHO level and
      age, sex, Ejection Fraction, functional capacity, N terminal -Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide
      hormone activity hormone level and kidney function indices will be evaluated.
