  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is a potent and highly selective inhaled Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase delta inhibitor
      being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective agent for the treatment of
      inflammatory airway diseases. The study will be conducted at a single centre and in 3 Parts.
      The aim of Part A and B of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) single and repeat doses of a new formulation of GSK2269557 administered
      via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) to healthy subjects. This is the first study in
      which GSK2269557 will be administered via the ELLIPTA DPI. Part C of the study will
      investigate the proportion of the systemic exposure that post inhalation is due to the
      swallowed fraction of the inhaled dose. Part C will also be conducted using the ELLIPTA
      device and magnesium stearate formulation. Part A will be conducted first. Part B and Part C
      may be run sequentially or in parallel. Part A is a randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled, single dose, dose escalating incomplete block 2-period crossover study in healthy
      subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either one dose strength of GSK2269557 and
      placebo utilizing placebo replacement, or will receive both active dose strengths. Part B is
      a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, repeat dose study in healthy Subjects.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either repeat doses of GSK2269557 or placebo for 10
      days. Part C is a, randomized, open-label, crossover design to assess the systemic exposure
      of single doses of GSK2269557 administered via the ELLIPTA DPI to healthy subjects, with and
      without ingestion of activated charcoal. ELLIPTA is the registered trademark of
      GlaxoSmithKline groups of companies.

        continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent
        basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (e.g.
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.
