  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that in elderly and frail patients, a narrower
      control of intraoperative blood pressure (BP) by the use of a continuous and noninvasive BP
      monitoring, coupled with an adequate depth of anesthesia, will reduce the incidence of
      postoperative cognitive impairment and the hospital length of stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive impairment (delirium and cognitive dysfunction) are frequent and
      feared complications in the elderly; they increase the postoperative morbidity and mortality,
      worsen the cognitive and functional outcome with loss of independence and increase the
      hospitalization length and costs . However, the etiology of these postoperative cognitive
      impairment, although probably multifactorial, remains unclear and strongly debated.

      The investigators hypothesize that excessive anesthesia depths associated with intraoperative
      hypotension may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment following
      surgery.
