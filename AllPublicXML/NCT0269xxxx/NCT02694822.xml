    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of an
      anti-CTLA-4 human monoclonal antibody (AGEN1884) and to estimate the MTD in subjects with
      advanced or refractory cancer. The study will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation cohort
      starting at a near minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) dose with expansion
      cohorts at 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg..

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects must agree to use
             adequate contraception or abstain from sexual activity from the time of consent
             through 90 days after the end of study drug. Adequate contraception includes condoms
             with contraceptive foam; oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives;
             contraceptive patch; intrauterine device; diaphragm with spermicidal gel; or a sexual
             partner who is surgically sterilized or postmenopausal.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Other malignancies treated within the last 5 years, except in situ cervix carcinoma or
             non-melanoma skin cancer.

          2. Other form(s) of antineoplastic therapy anticipated during the period of the study.

             disease [including autoimmune endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, and insulin
             dependent diabetes mellitus], or usage of immunosuppressive medications).

          6. Subjects with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2, human T
             lymphotropic virus 1, hepatitis B virus, or active hepatitis C virus.

          7. Subjects with a history of connective tissue disorders.

          8. Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following
             intervals before the first administration of study drug:

               1. ≤14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy.
                  Subjects must also not have had radiation pneumonitis as a result of treatment,
                  and cannot participate in the study if they are on chronic corticosteroids for
                  radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation to
                  non-central nervous system (CNS) disease with sponsor approval.

                  Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications.

               2. ≤28 days for a prior immunotherapy. No prior therapy with check point inhibitors,
                  costimulatory agonists or immunomodulatory agents is allowed.

               3. ≤28 days for prior monoclonal antibody used for anticancer therapy with the
                  exception of denosumab.

               4. ≤28 days for prior systemic corticosteroid therapy.

               5. ≤7 days for immune-suppressive-based treatment for any reason. Note: Use of
                  inhaled or topical corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is permitted.

                  Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved
                  after consultation with the sponsor.

               6. ≤28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose for all
                  other investigational study drugs or devices.

          9. Has not recovered to Grade ≤1 from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or complications
             from prior surgical intervention before starting therapy.

             Note: Subjects with Grade ≤2 neuropathy is an exception and may enroll.

         10. Uncontrolled infection or other serious medical illnesses.

         11. History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is
             clinically meaningful. Screening corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt; 470 msec is excluded
             (corrected by Fridericia). If a single QTc is &gt; 470 milliseconds, the subject may
             enroll if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 470 milliseconds. For subjects with an
             intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 milliseconds), the JTc interval
             may be used in place of the QTc with sponsor approval. The JTc must be &lt; 340
             milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. Subjects with left bundle branch
             block are excluded.

             Note: QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal or with
             medical monitor approval.

         12. Any medications that are known to prolong the QTc interval.

         13. Any medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude use of
             AGEN1884, including AGEN1884 hypersensitivity.

         14. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

         15. Concurrent participation in other investigational drug trials.

         16. Subjects with a history of or active CNS tumors or metastases from non-CNS tumors.
