  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Cystic Fibrosis have increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant
      systems. Under certain conditions, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake may have a favorable
      role in reducing redox status.

      In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, DHA (Pro-Mind) and placebo (sunflower
      oil) capsules, will be given, daily to 10 patients, 5 mg/kg for 2 weeks then 10 mg/kg for the
      next 2 weeks. Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and vitamin E levels will be measured. Plasma
      and platelet lipid compositions will be determined.
