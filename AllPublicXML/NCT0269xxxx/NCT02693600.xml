      1. Introduction:

           Investigators think that surgery with preservation of healthy joints (hemitrapeziectomy)
           in trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis without affecting sapho-trapezo-trapezoid joints,
           is better for scaphoid stability by preventing its collapse and thus preserving the
           stability of the carpus.

        2. Objectives and Hypothesis:

           Ligamentoplasty with partial trapeziectomy in grades II-III Eaton presents better
           results in the pollicis-lateral pinch (key pinch) strength than ligamentoplasty with
           total trapeziectomy.

           Main Objective:

           To demonstrate using the dynamometer that the postoperative key pinch strength higher
           using ligamentoplasty with partial trapeziectomy in grades II-III Eaton.

           Secondary objectives:

           To measure the collapse of the first column of thumb using calibrated radiographic
           analysis. Pain (E.V.A Scale). Range of motion (measured with goniometer). Quality of
           life (DISABILITIES OF THE ARM, SHOULDER AND HAND questionnaire).

        3. Methodology:

      It is a single-center randomized trial, parallel-group, in which two types of surgical
      techniques (TT - TP) will be compared. Patients will be randomized in this two techniques
      will be followed for one year, in routine clinical practice.
