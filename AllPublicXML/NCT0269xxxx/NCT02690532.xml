    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of gluten on gut barrier function. Investigators at the
      Mayo Clinic have developed a new gut permeability test using rhamnose (sugar &amp; water
      solution), and are hoping to prove its effectiveness in a clinical setting.

      The aim of this study is to assess effect of gluten on the gut barrier function in patients
      at high risk for celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) patients. This study
      will assess the gut permeability in three groups of patients 1) children who are at high risk
      for developing celiac disease (CD) (siblings of patients with celiac disease), 2) Children
      who are self-diagnosed with NCGS and 3) control group of patients matched for age and gender.
      Patients will undergo celiac serologic and genetic testing, after which the rhamnose test
      will be performed to assess the presence of increased gut permeability.

        The study population will consist of three groups of children, aged 2-17 years. The first
        group will be children with siblings that have celiac disease, the second group will be
        children with non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the third group will be healthy children.
