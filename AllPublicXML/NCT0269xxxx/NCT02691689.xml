    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is
      associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality.

      Next to environmental risk factors, the investigators believe that there is an important role
      of genetic predisposition to develop PAH in CHD. There often is a discrepancy between the
      severity of PAH and the CHD, where it is useful to screen for PAH gene mutations. The
      investigators hypothesize that the genotype is partly responsible for the phenotypic
      variability in patients with congenital shunt lesions, where some develop PAH and others do
      not. If a genetic predisposition for PAH in CHD could be identified, then genetic screening
      could be a useful additional tool for early detection of patients at risk of pulmonary
      vascular disease and PAH development, with new opportunities for prevention or early
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) usually
      develops secondary to chronic volume overload of the pulmonary circulation following left to
      right shunt. This overload leads to elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and later to
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance. This causes pressure overload in the right heart,
      and thereby right ventricular and right atrial dysfunction, which may implicate considerable
      morbidity and even mortality.

      Since PAH nowadays is mostly detected when symptoms occur and PAP are elevated, the disease
      already evolved to an advanced (partially irreversible) stage and treatment is often
      initiated too late.

      Next to environmental risk factors, the investigators believe that there is an important role
      of genetic predisposition to develop PAH in CHD. In the past, certain genes have been
      identified that play a role in the development of atrial septal defect (ASD). There are also
      a lot of genes identified that play a role in PAH. Until now, not many research groups have
      studied a genetic link between CHD and PAH development. But it becomes more and more clear
      that there often is a discrepancy between the severity of PAH and the CHD, where it is useful
      to screen for PAH gene mutations. The investigators hypothesize that mutations in some of
      these known PAH genes or in other, still unidentified, genes are partly responsible for the
      phenotypic variability in patients with congenital shunt lesions, where some develop PAH and
      others do not. If a genetic predisposition for PAH in CHD could be identified, then genetic
      screening could be a useful additional tool for early detection of patients at risk of
      pulmonary vascular disease and PAH development, with new opportunities for prevention or
      early treatment.
