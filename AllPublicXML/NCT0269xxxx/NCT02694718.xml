    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological complete tumor response was defined as grade 3 or 4 in the histological grading of regression according to Dworak classification. Grade 0 is no regression; Grade 1 is dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy; Grade 2 is dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumor cells or groups; Grade 3 is defined as very few (difficult to find microscopically) tumor cells in fibrotic tissue with or without mucous substance; Grade 4 is defined as no tumor cells, only fibrotic mass (total regression or response).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Resection (R0) in Participants With T4 Rectal Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>R0 resection was defined as complete resection of the tumor with adequate tumor-free margins and regional lymph node extirpation as confirmed by pathology after pre-operative chemotherapy plus capecitabine + oxaliplatin therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Downstaging of Primary Tumor and/or Lymph Nodes</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Downstaging of primary tumor (T) and/or lymph nodes (N) was defined as decrease by 1 point in T-value and/or N-value (comparing at screening and after treatment). It was assessed by colonoscopy, pathology, endosonography of rectum, chest X-ray, abdominopelvic Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Staging for tumor are: TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed), T0 (no evidence of primary tumor), Tis (carcinoma in situ), T1 (tumor invades submucosa), T2 (tumor invades muscularis propria), T3 (tumor invades through muscularis propria into subserosa/into non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues, T4 (tumor directly invades other organs or structures). Staging for lymph nodes are: NX (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes), N2 (metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Incomplete Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological incomplete tumor response was defined as grade 1 or 2 in the histological grading of regression according to Dworak grading of regression. Pathological incomplete tumor response rate, Grade 1: dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy; Grade 2: dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumor cells or groups (easy to find) were assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants or clinical investigation participants administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>Downstaging of primary tumor (T) and/or lymph nodes (N) was defined as decrease by 1 point in T-value and/or N-value (comparing at screening and after treatment). It was assessed by colonoscopy, pathology, endosonography of rectum, chest X-ray, abdominopelvic Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Staging for tumor are: TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed), T0 (no evidence of primary tumor), Tis (carcinoma in situ), T1 (tumor invades submucosa), T2 (tumor invades muscularis propria), T3 (tumor invades through muscularis propria into subserosa/into non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues, T4 (tumor directly invades other organs or structures). Staging for lymph nodes are: NX (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes), N2 (metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes).</description>

          <description>Downstaging of primary tumor (T) and/or lymph nodes (N) was defined as decrease by 1 point in T-value and/or N-value (comparing at screening and after treatment). It was assessed by colonoscopy, pathology, endosonography of rectum, chest X-ray, abdominopelvic Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Staging for tumor are: TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed), T0 (no evidence of primary tumor), Tis (carcinoma in situ), T1 (tumor invades submucosa), T2 (tumor invades muscularis propria), T3 (tumor invades through muscularis propria into subserosa/into non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues, T4 (tumor directly invades other organs or structures). Staging for lymph nodes are: NX (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes), N2 (metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes).</description>
