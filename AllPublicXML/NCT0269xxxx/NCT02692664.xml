      In this study, patients will be observed who receive an E-liac Stent Graft for treatment of
      isolated iliac aneurysms or an E-liac Stent Graft in combination with one of the following
      AAA stent grafts: E-tegra Stent Graft, Endurant AAA Stent Graft, Zenith AAA Endovascular
      Graft, Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis for treatment of aorto-iliac aneurysms.

      Objectives of this post-market registry are:

      Primary: To prevent the risk of rupture and death by the treatment of common iliac aneurysm
      with an iliac branched stent graft (E-liac, JOTEC) Secondary: Evaluation of safety and
      feasibility of the E-liac Stent Graft System used in endovascular treatment of uni- or
      bilateral aorto-iliac or iliac aneurysm.

    <description>Clinical success related to the E-liac Stent Graft combines the following criteria (adapted from Chaikof 2002):
Clinical success should be reported on an intent-to-treat Basis
requires successful deployment of the E-liac Stent Graft at the intended location without
Death as a result of iliac aneurysm-related treatment
Type I or III endoleak
E-liac Stent Graft infection
E-liac Stent Graft thrombosis (including internal iliac artery thrombosis)
Aneurysm growth &gt;3mm in maximum diameter for common iliac aneurysm and &gt;5mm in maximum diameter for aortic aneurysm at 12, 24, and 36 months follow-up
Common iliac aneurysm rupture
Conversion to open repair
