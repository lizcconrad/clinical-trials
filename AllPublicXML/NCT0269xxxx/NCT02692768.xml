  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if music therapy interventions as adjunct to
      standard surgical care reduces pre- and post-operative pain and anxiety in patients
      undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty as compared with patients who receive standard of care
      without music therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded clinical trial. The primary objective is to
      measure differences in pain and anxiety scores before and after music therapy interventions
      as compared to patients who do not receive music therapy.

    <description>Patients will be asked to return to the research site a total of six times (pre-operative, pre-surgery, post-surgery, recovery visit (12-24 hours after surgery), two-weeks post-operative visit, and 6 months post-operative visit). Pain scores will be recorded at each of these times.</description>

    <description>Live sedative guitar playing within a limited chord progression will be utilized. Added to this music will be vocal and verbal therapeutic suggestion for active listening, focused breathing, muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. Patients will choose from one of three nature scene options for the guided imagery in order to include patient preference of content. This treatment group will experience this music intervention live, including patient-centered interaction with the music therapist and education for repeated use of the routine on recording.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will meet with the music therapist to indicate preferences for one of three guided imagery scenarios to be included in their music-assisted relaxation routine. Patients will then receive live music relaxation and education for practice using a CD. Once admitted for surgery, patients will be seen immediately prior to going to the OR in the SDU, immediately following surgery in the PACU, and then within 12-24 hours of surgery on the inpatient floor. Pain and anxiety measures will be gathered at routine follow-up appointments following discharge (2 weeks and 6 months post-operatively).</description>
