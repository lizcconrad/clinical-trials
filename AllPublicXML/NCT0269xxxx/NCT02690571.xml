  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution is a global environmental and health concern, contributing to onset and
      deterioration of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. As climate change and dependence on
      diminishing fossil fuel supplies have taken center stage in political and scientific debates,
      renewable carbon-neutral fuels like biodiesel receive increasing attention. The most common
      biodiesel within the European Union, rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) is perceived to be a
      &quot;green fuel&quot;, as it is sustainable and of biological origin, and therefore is often predicted
      to be less harmful to human health. Whilst replacing petrodiesel with biodiesel may have
      advantageous ecological impacts, consequences to respiratory health remained largely
      unexplored.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether inhalation of 100% RME biodiesel
      exhaust would result in an acute airway inflammatory response in healthy human subjects, as
      shown previously following exposure to petrodiesel exhaust.
