      This randomized, double-blinded, sham acupuncture controlled trial is aimed to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of Primary Sjögren Syndrome.The
      eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive acupuncture or sham acupuncture
      for 8 weeks.

      Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 85%, and a 20% drop-out, a sample sized of 30
      would be needed for each group. The statistical analysis will be based on the
      intention-to-treat principle. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test or
      Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables will be analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's
      exact test or Kruskal-Wallis H test as appropriate. For comparison between two time points,
      paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used as appropriate. A statistically
      significant difference was set at P&lt;0.05.

    <description>Acupoints include 11 on the head, two on the upper extremities, and two on the lower extremities. Before performing acupuncture, a small pad will be pasted on each acupoint. All the needles will insert the acupoints through these pads. Then, they will be twirled, lifted and thrust three times to elicit the Deqi sensation. Each session will last 30 minutes.</description>
