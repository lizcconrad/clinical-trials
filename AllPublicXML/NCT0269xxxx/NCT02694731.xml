  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a 5-week smartphone app-based intervention that teaches mindful
      eating skills. One goal is to determine to what extent participants will enjoy using the app
      and complete the intervention. The investigators predict that after completing the
      intervention, participants will report fewer episodes of eating in response to food cravings.
      The investigators will also measure several other biological and behavioral outcomes.

    <textblock>
      In this prospective repeated-measures cohort study, participants will complete a 5-week
      smartphone app-based intervention that teaches mindful eating skills. The investigators will
      assess psychological and behavioral intervention targets using questionnaires and brief
      mobile assessments. The investigators will also measure BMI and adiposity. Assessments will
      occur at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1 and 2 months post intervention. At
      several times during the study, participants will also receive multiple daily text messages
      asking them to complete a brief food craving assessment on their phone. This &quot;experience
      sampling&quot; approach is critical as it allow the investigators to capture experiences and
      behaviors that are often brief and automatic, making them poorly suited to traditional
      retrospective questionnaires. The investigators will also assess acceptability and continued
      use of the app via anonymous usage logs.

      Overall, the aims are to 1) assess feasibility of the protocol, 2) assess changes in food
      cravings and indulgence of cravings, and 3) determine the extent to which participants remain
      engaged with the app after completing the 5-week intervention period and whether this
      predicts maintenance of benefits at 1 month and 2 months post-intervention. An exploratory
      aim is to measure the effects of the intervention on body weight, bodyfat, and bodyfat
      distribution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Problems with controlling food intake as indexed by &quot;yes&quot; responses to the following
             two questions: &quot;Do you have food cravings?&quot; and &quot;Do you eat in response to your food
             cravings more than you would like to?&quot;

          -  Overweight or obese (BMI of 25.0 to 39.9 kg/m2)

          -  Score at or above the scale midpoint on the Readiness Ruler, a single-item visual
             analog scale measure of readiness for behavioral change (prompt is, &quot;I have decided to
             give in to food cravings less&quot;)

          -  Have and use a smartphone (Android or iOS) with internet access.

          -  Report food cravings on most days and a desire to indulge in food cravings less

               3. Likely to have provided untruthful answers to the screening questions (based on
                  evidence such as unclear or inconsistent responses when talking to study staff
                  vs. reporting online, or log data showing repeated attempts to &quot;game&quot; the
                  screening questionnaire).
