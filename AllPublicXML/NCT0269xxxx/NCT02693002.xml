  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-menopausal women will be randomized to hormone replacement therapy or placebo for 12
      weeks to determine if markers of systolic and diastolic function change by echocardiography
      as well as laboratory markers of heart failure, including b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).

    <textblock>
      This preliminary, feasibility study will randomize 28 peri-menopausal women to either hormone
      replacement therapy or placebo for 12 weeks. Prior to randomization, each participant will
      undergo echocardiography, measurements of activity using the Duke Activity Status Index,
      measurements of quality of life and laboratory data, including b-type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) measurements. Following the intervention for 12 weeks, these measurements will all be
      repeated.
