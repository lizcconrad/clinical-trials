  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amniotic fluid (AF) pH can be affected by the maternal and/or fetal conditions such as PPROM,
      prematurity or fetal distress. It is known that fetal urine is the major content of AF since
      20th gestational week. Besides fetal alveolar fluid (FAF), gastrointestinal tract, umbilical
      cord and fetal side of placenta are important sources for AF. Bombesin-like peptides,
      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in fetal urine and leukotriene E(4), lecithin, sphingomyelin,
      lamellar body in FAF are molecules acting on fetal lung maturation. Varying levels of these
      molecules relevant to the stage of lung maturation may constitute an association to AF pHTo
      detect the possible effect of AF pH on neonatal respiratory morbidities 1 milliliters of AF
      is aspirated during C-section before incision of membranes. pH value of AFs were analyzed by
      the blood gas machine (Siemens RAPIDLabÂ®1200 Systems) of NICU. Maternal and neonatal
      demographic features and clinical outcomes, incidences of morbidities such as respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) are all recorded.
