    <textblock>
      This study was to test the hypothesis that an optimized savory cluster (Test-cluster) made
      through a proprietary baking process combined with slow digestible carbohydrates and fiber
      will elicit lower postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses than a Control-cluster
      made from general processing procedure and with typical ingredients commonly used in
      commercially available snacks or bars: oats, peanuts, and corn syrup. However, since the
      Test-cluster contains ~30% less available-carbohydrate (24g) than the Control (33g), the
      postprandial responses elicited by the Test-cluster was also compared with those after a
      portion of White-bread matched for available-carbohydrate content. On 3 separate days, 25
      healthy male or non-pregnant females aged 18-60 yr with BMI between 20 and 35 kg/m² with
      fasting serum glucose &lt;7.0mmol/L (126 mg/dL) were asked to consume 1 serving (56g) of the
      Test- or Control-cluster or 47g White Bread and had blood glucose and insulin measured at
      intervals over the next 4 hr. Each serving of Test-cluster and Control-cluster contained
      similar amounts of total carbohydrates, protein, fat and energy content. Each serving of
      Test-cluster and White-bread had equivalent amount of 24g available carbohydrate.

      On each test occasion, after subjects were weighed, 2 fasting blood samples were obtained by
      finger-prick 5min apart and after the 2nd sample, the subject started to consume a test meal.
      Subjects were asked to consume the entire test meal within 10 min. At the first bite a timer
      was started and blood samples for were taken for glucose analysis at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
      90, 120, 180 and 240 min after starting to eat. Additional blood was taken into a separate
      vial at -5, 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min for insulin analysis. Blood samples were
      obtained from hands warmed with an electric heating pad for 3-5 min prior to each sample.
      During the 4hr of the test, participants remained seated quietly. After the last blood sample
      participants were offered a snack and then allowed to leave.
