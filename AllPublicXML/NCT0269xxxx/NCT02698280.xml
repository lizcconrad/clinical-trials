    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab and nimustine are effective in
      the treatment of recurrent high grade glioma and to explore whether there is any subgroup
      being sensitive to this therapeutic protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anti-angiogenesis therapy for glioblastoma(GBM) are showing promise, GBMs often
      develop resistance to treatment within months or weeks after salvage therapy. There are still
      no effective markers to predict the response rate to bevacizumab.

      So the investigators initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of bevacizumab and nimustine regimen and to explore the predictive markers in
      patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.

    <description>Patients are treated with bevacizumab and nimustine. Every 6 weeks is defined as one therapeutic cycle. Adverse effect is evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.03). Hematologic toxicity is evaluated every 2 weeks. Liver function, renal function, and electrolytes are assessed every 4-6 weeks. Platelet should be no less than 100*10^9/L and neutrophil count should be no less than 1.5*10^9/L.</description>

             than 28 days after operation for recurrent tumor or prior chemotherapy.
