  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multi-center, Phase 2,
      proof-of-concept efficacy and safety study in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring
      hemodialysis.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety profile of PA101B delivered
      via eFlow high efficiency nebulizer in patients with uremic pruritus who are symptomatic
      despite using standard treatments.

      The symptom score for determining eligibility will be established during the Screening Period
      (up to 4 weeks) and eligible patients will be randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio between the
      active and placebo arms at the baseline visit (Week 0). During the Treatment Period, clinic
      visits will occur at the end of Weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7. Following completion of the Treatment
      Period, patients will enter a 2-week Washout Period in both treatment arms.

      Routine hemodialysis treatment will continue according to the dialysis unit's standard
      practice in all patients.

      Patients will be allowed to continue to use the same daily doses of pre-randomization H1
      antihistamines as well as the same daily doses of any other allowed medications throughout
      the study.

      Blood samples will be collected for various biomarkers. In a subset of patients, additional
      blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic assessments. Clinical safety assessments
      will be performed at each clinic visit.
