  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social interaction (in the form of serve and return exchanges) between child and parent are
      crucial for psychosocial, physical and cognitive development. Parents in sub-Saharan
      countries are ill-equipped to maximize the benefits from this interaction. The investigators
      approach builds on the traditional outlook that &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot; i.e.,
      not only the parents but other extended family members play a role as caregivers to young
      children. The investigators intention is to use the existing post-natal/child welfare clinics
      to deliver an intervention, which uses culturally acceptable videos and active skills
      building, to deliver health messages and practical skills to women, with the intention that
      they will subsequently engage and teach their partners and other caregivers about early brain
      stimulation and child development.

      A two arm cluster randomized control design will be used to select a total of about 400
      participants each of the control and intervention groups. The participants will be drawn from
      primary health care (PHC) centres offering immunization services in Ibadan. In the
      intervention group, mothers will be trained on early brain stimulation using group video
      sessions followed by individualised question and answer sessions. These sessions will take
      place at 6 week and 10 week post natal immunisation visits. The control arm will receive the
      standard of care - routine immunization care- group health talks.

      The child's development will be assessed using the Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children
      (SWYC) instrument.

      Outcome variables will include changes in self-reported early child brain stimulation
      behaviour and increase in the awareness of parents and significant others on the social and
      emotional difficulties of children.

    <description>This group receives the usual routine immunization at 6, 10, 14 weeks and 9 months and an Edutainment intervention package of limited group (i.e., 3-5 women) drama based video session (Edutainment) followed by a Question and Answer session with mothers on early brain development, parenting skills, communication and negotiating skills at 6 weeks. Mothers will be encouraged to train fathers and other caregivers at home with reinforcement of key messages at subsequent clinic visits. Key messages will be delivered through the use of flip charts at 14 weeks and given to mothers as take home for use in engaging the fathers partners and other caregivers for their child. Reinforcement of key messages at subsequent visits will be through the use of videos and flip chart.</description>
