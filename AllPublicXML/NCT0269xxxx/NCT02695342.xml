  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that older adults with COPD have important
      problems with their balance and a high incidence of falls compared to those of a similar age.
      This research will explore the feasibility and preliminary effects of a tailored 6-month home
      balance exercise program for reducing falls in older adults with COPD.

    <description>The home-based exercise program will be tailored to address the underlying balance deficits in COPD and individualized according to each participant's ability. Physiotherapists will teach the program in four home visits over the first 6 weeks of the study; in the event of an exacerbation, a fifth visit will be provided to modify the program. Participants will be given an exercise DVD (with portable player), and will be instructed to perform the program 3 times/week for 6 months. Therapists will provide bi-monthly telephone support.</description>
