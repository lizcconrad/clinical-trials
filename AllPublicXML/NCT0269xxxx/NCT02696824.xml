      The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-arm effectiveness trial in Cape Town, South
      Africa of a Xhosa-adapted, nurse-delivered, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for
      depression and adherence, integrated into the HIV care setting in patients with HIV who did
      not achieve viral suppression from first-line treatment. The CBT treatment will be compared
      to enhanced usual care (Enhanced Treatment As Usual - ETAU) on study endpoints (as described
      in study endpoints section below).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical Clinical depression is one of the highest comorbidities to HIV/AIDS, with estimated
      rates up to 34.9 percent. Depression, in the context of HIV, leads to poor self-care behavior
      such as non-adherence to ART and worse retention in care, which are critical for treatment
      success. Based on our prior work, and given that CBT is an evidenced-based treatment for
      depression, this is a two-arm effectiveness randomized controlled trial of nurse-delivered
      cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and adherence integrated into the HIV primary
      care setting in S. Africa. To ensure that those who need this intervention the most will
      receive it, participants will be patients with HIV who did not achieve viral suppression from
      their first line ART, and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder.
