  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to raise awareness and improve HPV vaccination rates among children of
      Mexican American parents through the implementation of a tailored social marketing campaign
      which includes text messaging reminders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess a social marketing campaign on HPV
      vaccination with and without a text messaging reminder system targeting Mexican Americans in
      a community-based setting, at the Ventanilla De Salud (Health Window, VDS) program and the
      Consulate on Wheels-Ventanilla De Salud Movil (Mobile Health Window, VDS on wheels) program
      of the Mexican Consulate. Investigators plan on recruiting 200 Mexican American parents of
      children ages 9 through 17. Every VDS attendee eligible for the study and who is willing to
      consent to participate will be invited to the study. Consenting participants will be
      randomized to either a follow-up reminder text messaging system or to the group which will
      not receive the text messaging reminders. All participants, regardless of text messaging arm,
      will evaluate the campaign and investigators will assess adherence to the HPV vaccine for the
      total sample.
