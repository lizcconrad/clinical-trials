    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) most often affects the hip and knee joints. The first signs and symptoms
      of pain, stiffness or swelling are not uncommon in those in their thirties and forties and 10
      per cent report symptomatic knee OA by age 60 years. Education and exercise are essential for
      people with OA to help them manage their condition better. Exercise can reduce pain, improve
      mobility and enhance quality of life. However, doing the right exercises in the right way is
      important so that joints are not overly stressed.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an existing evidence-based program called, Good Life
      with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D). The program has been translated and adapted to the
      Canadian context and will now be implemented in a Canadian therapy setting to start to
      understand if it is effective. This is the first time this program is being tested in Canada.

      While some people have access to self-management programs for OA, these programs often
      provide only general exercise guidance and education. GLA:D integrates patient education and
      targeted, personalized exercise for people with hip and/or knee OA. Importantly, the
      exercises are taught so that individuals learn to incorporate them in their everyday
      activities. This research is the first step to understanding if people participating in this
      program have pain relief and improved function and if they are better able to manage their
      hip or knee OA symptoms. Additionally, this initial evaluation of the program will help
      create a better understanding of the challenges in delivering the program. This will be
      valuable information for offering future programs assuming success of this pilot study.

      It is anticipated that about 60 people (30 hip OA and 30 knee OA) will participate in this
      study. These people will be recruited from the Sunnybrook Holland Orthopaedic and Arthritic
      Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All consenting participants will receive the GLA:D Canada
      program delivered by Sunnybrook's therapists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis affects over 4.7 million Canadians and the majority of them have hip and/or knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). Analysis by the Arthritis Alliance of Canada estimates one new OA
      diagnosis every 60 seconds. Poorly managed OA results in significant pain and disability,
      reduced quality of life (QOL), limits work productivity and increases use of health care
      resources. Two of 3 people are under 65 years and 10 percent of people report pain and
      functional problems from knee OA by age 60 years. Current evidence indicates that education
      related to OA integrated with exercises targeted to the hip and/or knee joints are effective
      in reducing symptoms and improving patient function and QOL. Unfortunately, in Canada, while
      there are some programs for people with bone and joint problems (e.g. OSTEOFIT, Fit &amp; Strong)
      they are general education and exercise programs and are restricted to people over 60 years.
      In fact, a recent Bone and Joint Canada workshop identified implementation of evidence-based
      programs as the number one priority. Additionally, our research showed that people under 60
      years are looking for strategies to relieve and prevent OA symptom progression. An
      evidence-based targeted program integrating patient education and exercise for people with
      hip and knee OA, Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D), was implemented in Denmark
      by collaborator Roos in 2012. GLA:D is delivered by trained physiotherapists and includes
      patient education sessions and group exercise twice weekly for six weeks. Importantly,
      exercises are performed in positions and conditions reflecting daily life emphasizing the
      quality of performance, proper body position and individualized progression based on the
      patient's ability. The practical nature of these exercises improves adherence to the
      exercises in the longer term as they are easily transferrable to daily activities.
      Feasibility, safety and benefit of GLA:D have been demonstrated in individuals with mild to
      severe hip and knee OA. Since 2012, more than 5000 patients have been educated in GLA:D.
      Ongoing benefits for more than 2000 patients with one-year follow-up include pain relief with
      reduced use of medication, improved function and QOL, return to work, and ongoing use of the
      new knowledge and skills. Given its successful implementation and outcomes, pilot testing of
      GLA:D Canada and then potential provincial and national implementation and evaluation is
      highly appealing to address an urgent need for Canadians with hip and knee OA.

    <description>EDUCATION: 2 sessions cover OA topics (e.g. diagnosis, causes, risk factors, symptoms, treatment). Education also aims to strengthen beliefs in the value of exercise to control and improve pain and encourage exercise adherence after the program.
EXERCISE: 12 sessions (twice weekly, each about 1-hour) are supervised by therapist(s) with individual progression of exercises when good neuromuscular functioning is demonstrated. Exercises are performed using both legs and focus on sensorimotor control, functional stability, and muscular strength. Exercises involve a 10-minute cycle warm-up followed by a 4-station circuit (i.e. 2 exercises per station with 3 progressive levels of difficulty performed in 2 to 3 sets with 10 to 15 repetitions).</description>
