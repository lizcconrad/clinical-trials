      in Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure, hospitals will provide equitable care (regardless
      of race, ethnicity, age, or gender), the importance of scheduled physician follow-up after
      heart failure hospital discharge, the value in device-support as necessary for the acute
      heart failure patient, and many other significant findings.

      Achievement measures tracked through Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure:

        -  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at
           discharge

        -  Evidence-based specific beta blockers

        -  Measure left ventricular function

        -  Post-discharge appointment for heart failure patients
