  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to investigate whether a daily intake of lupin protein and a
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation training twice a day can improve local glucose uptake
      into m. soleus during a 60 day unloading phase with a special unloading device, the
      HEPHAISTOS orthosis (HEP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 60 day unloading intervention with the HEPHAISTOS unloading device had the following key
      objectives:

      primary hypothesis:

        -  Assesment and evaluation of insulin sensitivity and local glucose uptake in the unloaded
           m. soleus and whether it can be improved by dietary supplementation of lupin seeds and
           neuromuscular electrical stimulation.

      secondary hypotheses:

        -  Assesment and evaluation of unloading-induced reductions in muscle mass and whether they
           can be mitigated by dietary supplementation of lupin seed and neuromuscular electrical
           stimulation.

        -  Assesment and evaluation of whole-body glycemic effects of the interventions.
