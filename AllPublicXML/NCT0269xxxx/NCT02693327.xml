  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will examine the relationship interconnecting medical body health, mental
      health, and microbes of the digestive tract in persons living with serious mental
      illnesses,as compared to persons without such disorders. Existing research suggests that
      interactions between digestive tract microbes and the body may influence brain function
      circuits, mood, anxiety state, cognition, behavior, and medical physiology.

    <textblock>
      People living with serious mental illnesses have far shorter life expectancy due to various
      attending medical disorders. Vast knowledge gaps exist regarding microbial taxa responsible
      for governing various the human states of health or morbidity or interactions with
      medications. Serious mental illnesses collectively comprise the single largest medical
      category of life-long disability worldwide. Mounting evidence in humans and in animal models
      of schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related mental illnesses point to
      gut microbiome-host interactions that may influence brain function circuits, mood, anxiety
      state, cognition, behavior, as well as generate medical comorbidities. This research study
      will collect stool samples and blood for in vitro analysis of microbiome and metabolomics.
