    <textblock>
      Coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) has been launched in China for more than ten years.
      Although it effectively decreases the overall incidence of re-stenosis, DES cannot inhibit
      the progression of atherosclerosis plaque outside segments. It was shown that the progression
      rate of non-target atherosclerosis plaque for patients with DES implantation was 6-10%, which
      indicated that current secondary prevention for coronary heart disease (CHD) is far from the
      achievement of ideal conditions.

      Atherosclerosis has many risk factors based on current CHD guidelines, among which the level
      of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the most concerned one. Large clinical studies on statins
      were performed in the world during the past 20 years. It was demonstrated in these studies
      that statins were significant to both primary and secondary preventions of CHD. What's more,
      the lower of LDL level is reached, the lower incidence of clinical cardiovascular events is
      achieved. However, cardiovascular events were still not avoidable especially for the
      secondary prevention of CHD even if the level of LDL was significantly controlled under the
      recommended range of guidelines by high dosage of statins.

      It was shown in some recent studies that high loading dosage of statins may effectively
      control the progression of coronary plaque. However, multiple studies found it was hard to
      control the progression of all patients of coronary plaque due to individual difference.

      Currently China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has not approved the loading dosage of
      all statins because of possible high safety issues and confusions about the appropriate
      application in Chinese patients, as well as economy burden to Chinese patients with high
      treatment cost. How to evaluate individual progression risk of coronary plaque and enhance
      risk factors control and the treatment of statins for necessary population, is currently an
      issue, which should be solved in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD.

      The inhibition in the progression of atherosclerosis plaque is not absolutely dependent on
      the decrease of LDL. Large number of studies found other risk factors. For instance, diabetes
      and chronic kidney diseases may also be associated with the progression of plaque. However,
      the potential impact and control are still uncertain up to date.

      Based on these background, we design a retrospective study, Risk Factors Promoting Coronary
      Plaque Progression In China (The RIPPER Study), to solve these issues.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a national multicenter retrospective study. Through reviewing
      angiography database in 20 CHD intervention centers of China. We will collect the data of
      2400 patients with twice of coronary angiography as well as 12-24 months interval from Jun
      2013 to Dec 2016. We will confirm the actual rate in the coronary plauqe progression of CHD
      patients in China as well as regression analysis to investigate the impact of different risk
      factors on the progression of coronary plaque, thus find the primary risk factors and
      rational strategy in secondary prevention. In this study, the included patients should not be
      replaced or withdrawal.

      STUDY POPULATION 2,400 patients who are diagnosed with CHD and have received more than 2
      times of coronary angiography within 12-24 months will be enrolled. If the number of
      angiography is more than 2 times. Patients who receive examination not in the same coronary
      intervention center will not be included.

      STUDY DURATION It will take 12 months to collect data of 2,400 cases in 20 CHD intervention
      centers of China and following 9 months to compete QCA and risk factors analysis STUDY
      PROCESS The statistical analysis will include all the materials of cases. We will describe
      the basic history characteristics of patients, test parameters and the imaging
      characteristics of coronary angiography. Continuous variables will be described by number,
      mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum value and maximum value. Numeric variables
      with normal distribution will be described by mean and SD. Continuous variables will be
      compared by student test (normal distribution) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (skew
      distribution). Categorical variables (nominal variables/rank variables) will be described as
      frequency and percentage, which can be compared by Chi square test or Fisher exact test.
      Logistic multiple regression can be used to evaluate the risk factors of coronary disease
      progression in Chinese patients, among which the possible risk factors selection is based on
      clinical and statistical decision. Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve can be used
      to establish risk evaluation model of coronary disease progression and evaluate its value.
      The incomplete data will not be analyzed.

      Data analysis will be processed by SPSS 13.0. All the analysis will be used the 2-side test
      or 2-side 95% confidence interval. There is statistical significance if 2-side P value is
      less than 0.05. This study will use descriptive analysis and finally report primary and
      secondary outcomes by graphics.
