    <textblock>
      Although many adults with migraines use non-pharmacological treatment options, there is a
      lack of research on the use of many mind/body techniques specifically for headache. This
      research will further the understanding of the mechanisms, efficacy, and predictors of
      mind-body practices in adults with migraines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common and disabling pain condition. Affective/cognitive processes, such as
      pain catastrophizing and emotional reactivity, often play a major role in migraine pain and
      disability. These processes may be just as important to target as the sensory aspect given
      their impact on outcomes and disability. Because of this cognitive/affective load that builds
      over time in migraine, we hypothesize A) migraineurs perceive affective pain processing
      differently than non-migraineurs and B) mind/body therapies that target these factors may be
      especially beneficial and may differentially impact the affective component of migraine pain.
      Evidence shows that meditation decreases affective (e.g., pain unpleasantness) over sensory
      (e.g., pain intensity) response to experimental pain and reduces pain by engaging brain
      regions important for cognitive and affective modulation of pain. By measuring both
      experimental and clinical pain, the study team will be able to test these hypotheses.

    <description>MBSR is a standardized course in mindfulness mediation and yoga. The participants will meet weekly for 8 weeks for 2.5 hours, plus a &quot;mindfulness retreat day&quot; (approximately 6 hours) after the 6th class [9 total classes.] Mindfulness is cultivated through meditation, body scan (sequential attention to parts of the body), and mindful movement (bodily awareness during gentle stretching, based on yoga). The instructor also gives information about stress and stress relief.</description>
