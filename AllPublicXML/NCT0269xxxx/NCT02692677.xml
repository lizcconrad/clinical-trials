    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of
      JNJ-42756493 in healthy male adult participants after administration of a single oral dose of
      12 milligram (mg) of unlabeled JNJ-42756493 admixed with 14C JNJ-42756493.

    <textblock>
      This is a single--center, open--label (The researchers and participants know the treatment
      the participant is receiving) study. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (35 days ),
      Open-label Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to Day 14 or 28); and Follow-up (up to 30 days). Total
      duration of the study is approximately 79 to 93 days. Plasma and urine will be collected for
      determination of JNJ-42756493 concentrations. Participants will be primarily evaluated for
      absorption, the metabolic pathways and the excretion of JNJ-42756493. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
