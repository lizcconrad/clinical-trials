  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the recommended dose of MK-8628 for further studies in
      participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) including AML de novo and AML secondary to
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in participants with diffuse large B cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL). The recommended dose will be established by evaluating dose limiting toxicity (DLT),
      safety, tolerability, and early efficacy signals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AML (AML de novo and post-MDS) or DLBCL

          -  AML participants must have the following malignancy criteria: measurable and evaluable
             disease per tumor response criteria; ≥ 5% bone marrow blasts without alternate
             causality; and &gt; 90 days since allogeneic stem cell transplantation relapse in
             participants relapsing after transplant

          -  AML participants who are Philadelphia chromosome positive must have received ≥ 2 lines
             of therapy, including 2 bcr-abl tyrosine-kinase (TK) inhibitors (among imatinib,
             nilotinib and dasatinib), or only 1 line including 1 TK inhibitor if the
             relapse/refractoriness is associated with the detection of a resistance mutation to
             these inhibitors

          -  AML participants &lt; 60 years old must be in second or further relapse or relapsing
             after allogeneic stem cell transplantation regardless of number of relapses

          -  AML participants ≥ 60 years old in first relapse with a disease-free interval &lt; 12
             months, or further relapse. First relapse is also applicable to AML post-MDS patients
             who have received prior treatment for MDS, but have not received prior treatment for
             AML.

          -  DLBCL participants must have the following malignancy criteria: measurable and
             evaluable disease per tumor response criteria and ≥ 1 tumor mass that is ≥ 15 mm (long
             axis of lymph node) or ≥ 10 mm (short axis of lymph node or extra nodal lesions) on
             spiral CT scan; failed 2 standard lines of therapy (at least one containing an
             anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), or for whom such treatment is contraindicated.

             C), immunotherapy, hormone therapy or any other anticancer therapy or surgical
             intervention resection, or ≥3 half-lives for monoclonal antibodies, or ≥ 5 half-lives
             for other non-cytotoxic agents (whichever is longer)

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or active Hepatitis B or C
             infections

          -  Has one of the following cardiac-related conditions: Congestive heart failure; angina
             pectoris; myocardial infarction (within 1 year of study start); uncontrolled

          -  Is receiving other concomitant anticancer treatment

          -  Has received high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation
             less than 90 days prior to first dose of study treatment

          -  Is receiving concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A4 or CYP2A6 inhibitors or inducers

          -  Is pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Participation in a clinical trial involving an investigational drug within 30 days of
             study start

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment

          -  Has been previously treated with a Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitor

          -  Has acute promyelocytic leukemia, clinically uncontrolled disseminated intravascular
             coagulation, or peripheral cytopenia

          -  Has chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) or on immunosuppressive therapy for the
             control of GVHD

          -  Has uncontrolled disease-related metabolic disorder

          -  Unable to swallow oral medications, or has gastrointestinal condition deemed to
