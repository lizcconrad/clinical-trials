  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more
      effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted
      against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.

      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T
      cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma
      cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies
      have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most
      patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating
      free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in
      this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination)
      receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in
      the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.

      The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not
      progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other
      effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.

      Primary Endpoint (Phase Ib)

      Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0) and Cytokine Release Syndrome
      (CRS) toxicity will be graded according to the CRS Management Guidelines and CRS Toxicity
      Grading Scale

      complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients without complete
      response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per the Lugano
      classification

      Secondary Endpoints

      Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL
      to date of death and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for
      lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for
      lymphodepletion.

      Progression free survival is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients
      with a documented complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients
      without complete response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per
      the Lugano classification78 and will be measured separately in subjects receiving
      bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and
      fludarabine for lymphodepletion.

      The objective response rate will be defined as the rate of complete responses (CR) + partial
      responses (PR) as determined by the Lugano classification78 and will be measured separately
      in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a
      combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.

      The duration of response will be defined as time from documentation of tumor response to
      disease progression and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone

      lymphodepletion.

      Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). S

      Persistence of CAR.CD30 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative PCR and flow
      cytometry in peripheral blood samples and will be measured separately in subjects receiving
      bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and
      fludarabine for lymphodepletion.

      For adult patients: Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from
      the NCI PRO-CTCAE. Patient-reported physical function will be measured using the PROMIS
      Physical Function Score derived from the PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0.
      Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be measured using the PROMIS Global
      Health Score derived from the PROMIS Global Health Short Form v1.0-1.1.

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement

      Up to 100 mL per collection (up to 3 collections) of peripheral blood will be obtained from
      patients for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry
      less than 200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to
      isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.

      ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration

      ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be administered as described below 1-4 days (preferably 1-2 days)
      after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine. ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be given by a
      licensed provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes
      through either a peripheral or a central line. The expected volume will be 1-50cc. Patients
      with a partial response or stable disease at 6 weeks may receive a second infusion of
      ATLCAR.CD30 if cells are available. Note: Lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine
      will occur for three consecutive days and will not be given prior to a second infusion of
      cells (if applicable).

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) 1532 involves 1-2 infusions of
      ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:

        -  Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow-up

      Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR)
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse
      event.

    <description>Phase Ib: In adults, and separately, in children, two doses will be investigated 1x10^8 cells/m2 and 2x10^8 cells/m^2. The study team will run two independent dose-escalation sequences, one for adults and another one for children. The study team plans to use the 3+3 design and start with a low dose of 1x10^8 cells/m2. If there are no DLT in first 3 patients, the study team will go up to the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2. If there is toxicity in 1/3 patients in the initial cohort, the study team would expand to enroll up to 6 patients. If there are dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m^2, the study team will initially decrease the dose to an intermediate dose of 1.5 x 10^8 cells/m^.
Phase II: The study team planning to enroll 25 patients to contribute data. Sequential boundary will be used to monitor DLT rate.</description>
