      Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HBI-8000 administered
      orally. Patients must be hospitalized as per guidance of the treating investigator throughout
      Cycle 1. Patients will receive HBI 8000 twice weekly (BIW) (after breakfast), in 28 day
      treatment cycles.

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients. The first cohort of 3 patients will
      receive 30 mg BIW. Decisions regarding cohort escalation will be based upon the clinical
      experience in Cycle 1 (first 28 days) only. For a given cohort, if 1 patient enrolled in the
      cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days of the first dose, the
      cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.

         13. Patients with active clinically significant bleeding or recently occurred thrombotic
             diseases, including patients who are at a high risk for a thromboembolic event and are

             period and for 10 days after the last dose of study drug, women of child bearing
             potential, or men with a sexual partner of child bearing potential who are not willing
             to use double-barrier method during study period and at least 3 months (for men) or at
             least 1 month (for women) after the last dose of study drug. Double-barrier method is
             defined as a combination of 2 effective contraceptive methods, such as condom or
             condom containing spermicide in combination with a diaphragm, oral contraceptive, or
             intrauterine device.

             Note: Female subjects will be considered to be a woman of childbearing potential
             unless having undergone permanent contraception or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is
             defined as at least 12 months without menses with no other medical reasons (i.e.,
             chemical menopause because of treatment with anti-malignant tumor agents).

             hepatitis B surface antigen negative, a hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
             test [real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR]) measurement] should be performed and
             if positive, the patient should be excluded

         17. Patients who were in other experimental clinical studies with investigational agents
             within 30 days before the start of study drug administration (12 weeks for any
             investigational antibody therapy or investigational ASCT), or in current clinical
             studies with investigational agents

         18. Patients with a history of drug abuse or long-term excessive alcohol consumption which
             could affect study result assessment

         19. Patients considered by the investigator to be unsuitable for the study because of any
             significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the patient from participating in the study, or because of any condition
             that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study
