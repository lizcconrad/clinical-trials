    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an intervention combining a workshop
      during a balneotherapy and the use after the end of the balneotherapy of a web and
      smartphone-based physical activity program using connected devices, on physical activity
      level among patients 12 months after they participated in a balneotherapy in thermal care
      center.

      A multi center randomized controlled trial is setting to evaluate the impact of the
      intervention on physical activity recommendations achievement of the patients.

      Investigators hypothesize that an intervention including a workshop during a balneotherapy
      and an automated physical activity program using web, mobile phone and connected devices will
      help patients to be engaged in more physical activities and to reach physical activity
      recommendations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New technologies such as mobile phone and connected devices have been recognized as useful
      tools to assist chronic patients in their disease's management. they are also considering as
      promising tools to help patients to change their lifestyle behavior.

      Balneotherapy is a very special moment to initiate changes and to raise awareness about
      healthier behavior in terms of food and physical activity.

      The objective of the intervention is to help patients with chronic diseases, taking part in a
      balneotherapy, to increase or maintain their physical activity level in the long term to
      reach the national recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.

      Patients will be randomized either in the intervention group or in the control group.

      The intervention group will participate in a workshop during the balneotherapy providing them
      informations about physical activity and also about the way to use the web and
      smartphone-based physical activity program along with the use of the connected devices (scale
      and pedometer). After the end of the balneotherapy, the intervention group will have access
      to the web and smartphone-based physical activity program during 12 months.

      The control group will receive a booklet including informations about physical activity
      practice.

Physical activity will be measured by IPAQ questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire). Achievement of physical activity recommendations corresponds to 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.
To compare physical activity at 12 months, a constrained Longitudinal Data Analysis will be used involving the repeated measure of physical activity at inclusion and every 2 months until the end of the 12 months of follow-up.</description>
