  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients
      with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for
      peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, two small clinical trials showed the
      positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy. One study shown the PRP has therapeutic
      effect for peripheral neuropathy in patients with leprosy. In addition, PRP having protective
      effect against neurological deficit of facial nerve during superficial parotidectomy.
      However, these studies have not entirely proved the effects of PRP on peripheral neuropathy
      because these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. In
      addition, the PRP was not used for treating CTS so far. The investigators design a
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided PRP
      injection in patients with CTS.

    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with CTS were
      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided 5% dextrose injection. No additional treatment after injection through the
      study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median
      nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The
      evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th
      week after the treatment.

    <description>The antidromic sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was performed on all subjects according to the protocol reported by the American Academy of Neurology (USA).
