        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female between the ages of 2 and 80 years (inclusive).

          -  Subject has a documented history of lesions and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis
             of hypoplasminogenemia

          -  Subject has plasminogen activity level â‰¤ 45%.

          -  Subject has documented vaccination to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or has received the first dose of HAV and HBV vaccine prior to the first dose
             of investigational drug and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. If
             subject has documented vaccination more than 1 year before screening but has a
             negative antibody titer to HAV and/or HBV at screening, subject is required to begin a
             re-vaccination series with the first dose of HAV and/or HBV vaccine prior to the first
             dose of investigational drug and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. No
             revaccination is required if the documented vaccination took place within 1 year of
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of anaphylactic reactions to blood or blood products that may
             interfere with participation in the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Subject has clinical or laboratory evidence of an intercurrent infection as evidenced
             by symptoms including fever, tachycardia, or other systemic signs and symptoms.*

          -  Subject is pregnant and/or lactating.

          -  Subject has a malignancy, except for basal or squamous cell skin cancer, within 3
             years before screening.

          -  Subject is a previous organ transplant recipient.

          -  Subject is in receipt of exogenous plasminogen (ocular or IV), such as laboratory
             grade plasminogen, fresh frozen plasma, or Plasminogen (Human) within 2 weeks of the
             first dose of the investigational drug.

          -  Subject has a psychiatric disorder, other mental disorder, or any other medical
             disorder that impairs the subject's ability to provide informed consent or to comply
             with the requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Subject has evidence of renal dysfunction defined as of &gt; 2 X the upper limit of
             normal (ULN) in serum creatinine.

          -  Subject has evidence of hepatic dysfunction defined as &gt; 3 x ULN in alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase
             (ALP).

          -  Subject has participated in another institutional review board-approved interventional
             clinical trial of a drug, biologic, or device within 30 days before the first dose of
             the investigational drug.

          -  Subject has a chronic or acute clinically significant intercurrent illness (e.g.,
             cardiac, hepatic, renal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, neoplastic,
             immunological, and skeletal) that the investigator determines could interfere with the
             assessments in this study.
