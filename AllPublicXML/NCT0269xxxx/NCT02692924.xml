  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Gravid diseases are complications in pregnancy. They include gestational diabetes and
      preeclampsia. These can cause problems with how a fetus grows. Being pregnant with twins can
      make complications more likely. Research suggests that changes in fetal soft tissue may be
      the earliest signs of growth problems. These tissue changes are in lean mass, fat mass, and
      organ size. 3D images might detect these changes earlier than 2D images. This could help
      manage gravid diseases. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons measured fetal growth for
      four racial groups, Caucasian, African American, Asian, and Hispanic. Fetuses of obese women
      and women with twins were also measured. 2D and 3D images were taken at various stages of
      pregnancy. Measurements were taken after birth. Researchers want to expand this study by
      measuring organ volumes and body composition by racial group and in twins.

      Objectives:

      To set standards for body composition and organ volumes by race. To understand the
      relationship between gravid diseases and changes in fetal body composition and organ volume
      over the course of pregnancy. To find out whether these are different for twins than for
      single pregnancies.

      Eligibility:

      Women who participated in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins.

      Design:

      The data will come from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins.

      Researchers will review scans taken in the previous study. They will take measurements from
      the scans.

      The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) will conduct a research study
      entitled: &quot;Fetal Body Composition and Volumes Study&quot; to catalog and perform 2 Dimensional
      (2D) and 3 Dimensional (3D) measurement of the obstetrical ultrasound images in the existing
      bank of singleton and twin gestations collected from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. The
      research study aims to augment the singleton Study with organ volumes by racial group and to
      understand the relationship between gravid diseases and longitudinal changes in fetal body
      composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and organ measurements (in singletons) over the
      course of pregnancy, thereby, complementing available data for the Cohort.
