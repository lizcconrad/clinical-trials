  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety of Apatinib at a dose level up to 750 mg/d
      with standard therapy of docetaxel (60 mg/m²) in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients
      harboring wild-type EGFR after failure of first line chemotherapy and to determine the
      recommended dose for the Phase II trial.
