      The purpose of this study is to observe inflammatory markers like TNF (tumor necrosis
      factor), IL-1 (interleukin-1), IL-6 (interleukin-6),TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on
      myeloid cells-1), etc, in patient of FUO with excess-heat syndrome and the influence of
      Compound Qingre Granule on the inflammatory markers.

      All the cases will be provided by the Infectious Diseases Department of Beijing Friendship
      Hospital.Each patient should sign informed consent. Assessing the accuracy, completeness, or
      representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to medical records. After
      collecting, sorting and entering the data, reducing the missing value, and then checking into
      the database.

      The stochastic indicator method will be used to simple random sampling, to ensure the
      probabilities of each individuals be given Chinese medicine intervention are equal.Operations
      must be standard to reduce errors.

      Quality assurance plan: Patient of fever within two weeks, or whose temperature is below 38.5
      degree centigrade will be excluded. The registration form includes the following parts: Name,
      sex, age, address, phone number, admission time, primary diagnoses and levels of Inflammatory
      markers.

      Data will be analyzed using the SPSS17.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions 17.0)
      statistical software. Difference of measurement data will be compared with analysis of
      variance,and difference of enumeration data will be compared with rank-sum test.P&lt;0.05 has
      statistical significance.
