    <textblock>
      Hip replacements are being performed on an increasingly active population, who are likely to
      wear their implants out prematurely. New hip replacements have been devised to minimise the
      risk of failure. DePuy RSA RCT is a randomised controlled trial designed to compare the
      performance of two established types of hip replacements using Corail and Tri-Lock stems
      along with Deltamotion acetabular component. The primary objective of the trial is to compare
      the long term stability of these two devices.To do this, the study will use an advanced 3D
      Xray technique to detect migration of the components at 3 years. The study will also measure
      micromotion of Corail, Tri-Lock and Deltamotion components, patient reported outcome measures
      and change in bone density.This study is being conducted at a single site, at the Nuffield
      Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford.

          -  Women aged between 18 and 65 years and men aged between 18 and 70 years.

               -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
                  study.

               -  Diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis.

               -  Able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study
                  requirements.

               -  Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate,
                  to be notified of participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patients with an inflammatory arthropathy, osteoporosis or deformities of the
             proximal femur.

               -  Patients who have significant co-morbidities that would make follow-up difficult

               -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in
                  the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability
                  to participate in the study.
