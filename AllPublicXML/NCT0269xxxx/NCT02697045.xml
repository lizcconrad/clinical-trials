      Primary Objective

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole long acting injectable form in Turkish patients
           with schizophrenia on psychosocial functioning, quality of life and patient reported
           acceptability of treatment. Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To evaluate the cognitive functioning of the patients

        -  To evaluate positive and negative symptoms of the Aripiprazole Long Acting Injectable
           (LAI),

        -  To evaluate adherence of Aripiprazole Long Acting Injectable (LAI) treatment,

        -  To evaluate tolerability of Aripiprazole Long Acting Injectable (LAI).
