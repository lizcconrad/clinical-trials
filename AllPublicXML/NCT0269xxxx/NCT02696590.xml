  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate oral and injectable routes in treatment of hypovitaminosis D in
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The investigators aimed to assess the efficacy of each
      method, using the same Mega dose of 600 000 IU D3, in achieving normal serum 25(OH)D level,
      the durability of the response, the practicality and the possible toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultraviolet sunlight is too low to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D3, and vitamin D
      insufficiency lasting 4 to 6 months of the year at latitudes of ≥42° is common in individuals
      with low vitamin D intake. Vitamin D has strong immunoregulatory effects, and vitamin D
      supplementation prevents experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune
      disease in animals that is used as a model of MS.

      Recently, emerging data from epidemiologic studies suggest that vitamin D may play an
      important role in the progression of the development of MS. A longitudinal study in pediatric
      MS showed a 34% lower risk of relapse for every 10 ng/ml higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. A
      similar magnitude of reduced relapse risk was later reported in an adult MS cohort. Higher
      vitamin D levels have also been shown to be associated with less subsequent inflammatory MS
      activity on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, studies have demonstrated that
      patients have lower vitamin D levels during MS relapses.
