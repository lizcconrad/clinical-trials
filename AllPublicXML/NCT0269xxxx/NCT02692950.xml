    <textblock>
      Rates of advance directive completion among Americans, even those suffering from serious
      chronic illness, are notoriously poor. Moreover, the contents of completed advance directives
      are often difficult to interpret in the face of a medical crisis. The study aims to examine
      patient perceptions of electronic, interactive versions of advance care planning
      documentation.

      The investigators are studying the video platform of a commercially available advance
      directive application, Honor My Decisions. This application was generated with funding from
      patient advocacy groups. The application allows a person to create a legally valid advance
      directive on his or her own tablet or smart phone and share that directive (either by
      printing or emailing a secure link to family and/or health care providers). Additionally, the
      app includes a feature by which individuals may record several 2-4 minute videos to
      memorialize their health preferences, and also to leave a more personal message for loved
      ones (a video legacy).

      The research team has compiled a list of question prompts for these advance care planning
      videos with the assistance of a panel of experts on communication, palliative care, critical
      care, ethics and the law. The investigators collected prompt suggestions from these 9 experts
      with a modified Delphi technique, using iterative surveys to generate consensus. The experts
      were instructed to consider both contents and phrasing of question prompts, to promote
      usability and also later utility (if the patient later became unable to speak for him- or
      herself). These question prompts will form the basis of this pilot study.

      The investigators aim to assess the experiences of patients completing electronic advance
      directives and documenting their care preferences and personal legacy via video. Renal
      dialysis patients have been selected as a patient population with frequent hospitalizations
      and low rates of advance directive completion. Patients will be given the opportunity to
      interact with the application and record their own videos. They will then provide immediate
      and long-term feedback about the video question prompts via interview.
