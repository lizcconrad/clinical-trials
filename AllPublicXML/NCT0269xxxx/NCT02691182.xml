  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children between the ages of 6-12 years who are diagnosed with impulsive aggression comorbid
      with ADHD and have participated in the 810P301 or 810P302 study are invited to participate in
      this study. This is a Phase 3 open label extension (OLE) study with the objective of
      collecting long-term safety data on the use of SPN-810 in treating impulsive aggression in
      pediatric subjects with ADHD, when taken in conjunction with standard ADHD treatment. After
      confirmation of eligibility, all subjects will be treated with SPN-810.Subjects will be given
      a choice to extend participation in this study every 6 months for up to 36 months.
