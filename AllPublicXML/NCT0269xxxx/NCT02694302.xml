    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted-gait-training (RAGT) in stroke patients to evaluate its efficacy, safety over
      conventional gait training.

      Experimental group receives robot-assisted-gait-training and conventional gait training.

      Active comparator group receives conventional gait training only as the same number as the
      experimental group.
