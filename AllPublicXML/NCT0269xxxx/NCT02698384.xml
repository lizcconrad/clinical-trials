  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the biochemical and clinical effectiveness on symptoms and tumor
      size of a monotherapy with Lanreotide 120mg in acromegalic subjects, to describe criteria for
      starting alternative strategies, and to describe the modalities and the global effectiveness
      of alternative strategies.
