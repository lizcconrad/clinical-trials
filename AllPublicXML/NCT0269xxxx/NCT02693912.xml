      In this study, the investigators aim to observe the change in alveolar macrophage function
      during acute lung injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar macrophages are tissue-resident or recruited cells with key functions in recognition
      of pathogens, initiation of host defensive ang protective inflammation,and in clearance of
      pathogens from the airways. However, macrophages are also responsible for efficient clearance
      of apoptotic neutrophils, termed efferocytosis, which is a prerequisite for the timely
      resolution of inflammation. In this study, the investigators aim to observe the change in
      alveolar macrophage function during acute lung injury.

    <measure>alveolar macrophages (AMs) phagocytic index</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after admission</time_frame>
    <description>AMs will be collected and cultured in vitro. Apoptotic neutrophils will then be cocultured with AMs for 1 hour. To measure phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, AMs were further processed and phagocytosed apoptotic neutrophils were detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described below under Cell staining and confocal microscopy. The phagocytic index was calculated according to the following formula: phagocytic index = (total number of engulfed cells/total number of counted macrophages) × (number of macrophages containing engulfed cells/total number of counted macrophages) × 100.</description>

        ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by an increased
        permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier resulting in lung edema with protein-rich
        fluid, thus resulting in impairment of arterial oxygenation. ALI/ARDS is defined as a lung
        disease with acute onset, noncardiac, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a
        paO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 for ALI or a paO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 for ARDS. The ageadjusted incidence of
        ALI/ARDS is estimated with 86.2 per 100,000 person-years. Despite all innovations in
        intensive care medicine, the mortality of ARDS remains up to 40%.
