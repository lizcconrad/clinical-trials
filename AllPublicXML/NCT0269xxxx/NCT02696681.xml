      Project AProaCH is an open pilot trial of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
      individuals with HIV with various psychological comorbidities, which the investigators call
      &quot;syndemics&quot;. Syndemics are co-occurring psychosocial problems that interact with each other
      and with health behavior such as HIV sexual transmission risk behavior and adherence to self
      care.
