    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II trial in patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy.
      Patients entering the study will all receive initial 50 Gray (Gy) radiotherapy (25 x 2Gy) to
      the prostate bed and thereafter be classified as either responders or non-responders
      depending on PSA response at fifth week of radiotherapy.

      A 68-Ga- PSMA-PET is done before start of radiotherapy, and analyzed before fifth treatment
      week in order to identify cancer lesions in patients with poor PSA response. Patients with
      PSA response after 5 weeks of radiotherapy will not receive any subsequent therapy, whilst
      patients with poor PSA response may be in need for additional therapy such as radiotherapy to
      lymph node metastases and/or boost fractions to local recurrence. Patients with more than 3
      lymph node metastases or distant metastases will not receive any more radiotherapy, but
      individualized systemic therapy will be started.
