    <textblock>
      Real-time optical surface monitoring data will be acquired from 44 human patients with
      primary or metastatic lung lesions during and after their 4DCT scan (standard-of-care at our
      institution). A patient-specific 4D model will be developed using the raw 4DCT projections
      time-correlated with real-time surface monitoring. In addition, before delivering each dose
      fraction (3 - 5 for lung SBRT), we will acquire three 15s kV fluoroscopic image acquisitions,
      time-correlated with optical surface monitoring. The acquisitions will be distributed over
      three well-spaced beam angles, e.g., every 4th angle for a 12-field plan.

      Surface monitoring procedure ―The procedure is expected to last approximately 15 minutes
      after the end of the 4DCT scan, which is the standard-of-care for lung SBRT treatments at our
      institution. The procedure will consist of real-time surface tracking using the VisionRT
      system of the thoracic and/or abdominal region. Continuous audiovisual contact will be
      maintained with the subject during scanning. Each individual will be informed that they can
      stop the procedure at any point.

      Fluoroscopic imaging procedure ─ Fluoroscopic imaging will be performed in the treatment room
      with the patient lying in treatment position. Three 15s acquisitions will be performed under
      free breathing conditions, each from a different beam angle, using the on-board kV imager.
      Audiovisual contact will be maintained at all times with the patient.

      Data collection and management: An ID number will be assigned to each separate patient, and
      the correlation between ID number and patient name and medical record number will be kept in
      a password-protected file in Dr. Amit Sawant's office. The database of information extracted
      from the medical record and radiation treatment records for each patient will be stored in an
      Excel file on a computer with password protection. All image data will be de-identified by
      Dr. Sawant before his research team analyzes them.

    <description>Respiratory motion causes significant geometric and dosimetric errors in the administration of lung stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT). The purpose of this study is to create and validate patient-specific motion models of the thoracic anatomy with high spatial and temporal resolution. These models will be used to develop novel four-dimensional (4D=3D+time) techniques for radiotherapy treatment planning and real-time motion-adaptive dose delivery.</description>
