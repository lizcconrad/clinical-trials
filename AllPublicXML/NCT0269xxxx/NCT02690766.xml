      Investigators proposed to refine and test the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-month
      multi-modal lifestyle intervention in African American female breast or endometrial cancer
      survivors diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cohort studies show that physical activity can
      reduce mortality and morbidity in diabetes and obesity-related cancers. Yet, there have been
      few efforts to promote physical activity within the context of female cancer survivorship,
      particularly among women with diabetes. In response, investigators proposed to refine and
      test the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-month multi-modal lifestyle intervention in
      African Americans (AA) with diabetes and who are breast or endometrial cancer survivors. This
      web-based, lifestyle intervention, coupled with coaching calls and in-person exercise
      sessions, may be an effective way to promote physical activity and healthy survivorship. The
      primary goal is for participants to participate in 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous
      physical activity five times a week. The investigators' aims : i) refine a theory-driven
      healthy lifestyle intervention, that is delivered via computer technologies and periodic
      in-person group exercise sessions with appropriate content, literacy demand and graphics, ii)
      assess the preliminary effects of the intervention on the primary outcome of level of
      moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), as measured by accelerometry; weight A1C and
      evaluate the effect of eating behaviors, wellbeing/functioning (quality of life, depressive
      symptoms, self-efficacy), compliance/adherence to protocol and acceptability on response to
      the intervention.

    <description>Participants enrolled in Phase 2 of the study will meet once a month for 75 minutes over the course of 4 months. Within this 75 minutes, they will complete 25 minutes of physical activity with a licensed physical activity instructor that is very experienced with working with this population, review and discuss various topics/lessons that relate to diabetes, nutrition, survivorship and physical activity with the study's interventionist and Group Leader</description>
