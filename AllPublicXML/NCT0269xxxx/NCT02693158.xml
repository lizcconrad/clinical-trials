  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multicenter, single-arm, observational study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of a systematic direct stenting strategy with the Svelte SLENDER IDS
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent-on-a-Wire Integrated Delivery System (SLENDER IDS) in an
      all-comers, real-world population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this post-market study, the population will include real-world subjects who are intended
      to be treated, with SLENDER IDS as standard therapy. Follow-up contacts post procedure will
      be made for clinical assessments at hospital discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months.

      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, observational all-comers
      clinical study to collect ongoing safety and efficacy of SLENDER IDS and to determine the
      feasibility of a direct stenting strategy in an all-comers population. A minimum of two
      hundred fifty (250) subjects will be treated at up to 20 sites in Europe.

      Review of safety data and risks to subjects will be monitored by an independent Clinical
      Events Committee (CEC) at pre-specified enrollment milestones.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is â‰¥ 18 years old;

          2. Subject has symptomatic heart disease due to coronary artery lesions of length &lt; 28 mm
             and a reference vessel diameter 2.5 - 4.0 mm.

          3. Subject is intended to be treated with PCI and implantation of SLENDER IDS as part of
             his/her standard treatment

          4. Subject or subject's legal representative understands the study requirements and the
             treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any study specific
             tests or procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is unable to receive anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulant therapy;

          2. Subject is allergic to sirolimus, PEA III Ac Bz, cobalt, chromium, nickel or tungsten;

          3. The subject is judged to have lesions preventing complete inflation of an angioplasty
             balloon or proper placement of a coronary stent, including chronic total occlusions.

          4. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing (a pregnancy test must be performed
             within 7 days prior to the index procedure in women of child-bearing potential, based
             on the standard of care for the cath lab);

          5. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device clinical trial that
             the investigator feels would interfere with the subject's participation in this study.
