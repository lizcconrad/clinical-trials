  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the RAPID study is to fundamentally transform the way serious injuries are
      managed after earthquakes and other disasters by introducing a novel and cost-effective
      method for pain control. The study will enroll patients in the aftermath of a major
      earthquake to determine whether regional anesthesia, either with or without
      ultrasound-guidance, can reduce suffering from lower limb injuries, the most common
      earthquake-related injury, above and beyond the current standard of care for pain control in
      these settings.

      The Regional Anaesthesia for Painful Injuries after Disasters (RAPID) study aims to evaluate
      whether regional anesthesia (RA), either with or without ultrasound (US) guidance, can reduce
      pain from earthquake-related lower limb injuries in a disaster setting. The proposed study is
      a blinded, randomized controlled trial among earthquake victims with serious lower extremity
      injuries in a resource-limited setting. After obtaining informed consent, study participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to either: standard care (parenteral morphine at 0.1
      mg/kg); standard care plus a landmark-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB); or
      standard care plus an US-guided femoral nerve block. General practice humanitarian response
      providers who have undergone a focused training in RA will perform nerve blocks with 20 ml of
      0.5% levobupivacaine. US sham activities will be used in the standard care and FICB arms and
      a normal saline injection will be given to the control group to blind both participants and
      non-research team providers. The primary outcome measure will be the summed pain intensity
      difference calculated using a standard 11-point numerical rating scale reported by patients
      over 24-hours of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include overall analgesic
      requirements, adverse events and participant satisfaction.
