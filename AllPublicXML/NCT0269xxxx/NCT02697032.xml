  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The purpose is to evaluate whether non-invasive in vivo imaging of androgen
      receptor (AR) presence in metastatic breast cancer patients by means of
      18F-fluoro-dihydrotestosterone positron emission tomography (FDHT-PET) can be used to predict
      (early) treatment response to, and optimal dosing of, the anti androgen bicalutamide. The
      ultimate goal is to contribute to optimal selection of breast cancer patients for anti
      androgen treatment. Objective: Feasibility to detect a diffrence in uptake on 18F-FDHT scan
      after 6 weeks of treatment with bicalutamide in metastatic breast cancer patients. Secondary
      Objectives: to describe whether changes in 18F-FDHT tracer uptake after six weeks associates
      with response to bicalutamide, to describe whether changes in AR availability are different
      for breast cancer subgroups during treatment with bicalutamide and to describe whether
      18F-FDHT tracer uptake is influenced by the amount of AR tumor expression. Study design: This
      is a single arm, one stage feasibility study, which will be executed in the University
      Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate
      the difference in 18F-FDHT uptake in tumor lesions after 6 weeks of bicalutamide treatment in
      patients with AR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be treated with
      bicalutamide until progression or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Study population: The
      investigators will include 20 postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients with an AR
      positive, HER2 negative tumor. Patients should be restaged clinically with bone scintigraphy
      and CT scan within a 6 week timeframe of the PET examinations. Intervention: All patients
      will receive a baseline FDHT-PET scan and start with bicalutamide treatment 150mg daily.
      During follow-up patients will receive one FDHT-PET scan after 6 weeks. Treatment with
      bicalutamide will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Main
      study endpoint: The percent difference in 18F-FDHT uptake in tumor lesions after 6 weeks of
      monotherapy bicalutamide. A minimum decrease of 20% in 18F-FDHT uptake after 6 weeks compared
      to baseline uptake with an α of 0.05 and a power of 80%, is considered clinical significant.
