    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1/2 safety study of INCAGN01876 in subjects with
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors that will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will determine
      the pharmacologically active dose and/or maximum tolerated dose of INCAGN01876. Part 2 will
      further evaluate the recommended dose determined in Part 1 in subjects with select tumor
      types.
