      The study will invite 30 patients to join, and they will be arranged in the face to face
      group and telerehabilitation group randomly.

      In the telerehabilitation group, the investigators use the mobile device, which with the
      camera and speaker, for patients to practice the naming training at home, and assess the
      speech ability every 2-4weeks by speech therapist via telerehabilitation platform.

      Concise Chinese Aphasia Test (CCAT) and ASHA FACS conceptual framework Test will be used as
      the assessment tool for evaluation speech ability and functional ability.

      The investigators expect that patients can improve their speech ability, functional ability,
      and quality of life via telerehabilitation speech therapy.

      And the investigators can establish the standard telerehabilitation speech therapy protocol
      for aphasia therapy.
