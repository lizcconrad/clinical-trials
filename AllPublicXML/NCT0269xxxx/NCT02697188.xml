  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the serum pharmacokinetic profile for two oral formulations of T-esters (one TE and
      one TU) administered once -(QD) and twice-daily (BID) to hypogonadal men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five period cross-over study in which subjects received a single day of dosing in each
      period. Dosing was either QD or BID with one of two T esters (T-enanthate (TE) or
      T-undecanoate (TU)). Dosing was within 5 minutes of meals (breakfast and for BID dosing
      dinner). There was a minimum of a 5-day washout between periods. Subjects were hypogonadal
      men.
