    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a very common problem in the population. Most of the patients suffer from neck
      pain for long time and the problem becomes chronic. The investigators studied the effects of
      scapular stabilization exercise on mechanical neck pain.

    <textblock>
      Neck is one of the most common musculoskeletal problem in the world. Yet the problem still
      haven't been understood and solved completely. Its incidence is also becoming higher and most
      people who have neck pain suffer from it for long time. Several problems have been related to
      neck pain. Hence, the investigators designed a study to see the effects of scapular
      stabilization exercise on neck pain.

    <description>patients in this arm received classical approaches for neck pain. Cervical manual therapy was performed on patients in this arm and they were also instructed to to perform cervical endurance, strength and stretching exercises. Rehabilitation period was lasted for 6 weeks. Pain, quality of life and scapular kinematics were assessed before and after rehabilitation program.</description>

    <description>patients in this arm received cervical manual therapy and cervical exercises too. Apart from cervical manual therapy and cervical exercises,patients also performed scapular stabilization exercise targeting trapezius, serratus anterior and rhomboid muscles. Rehabilitation period was lasted for 6 weeks. The same assessment parameters was conducted on this arm too.</description>
