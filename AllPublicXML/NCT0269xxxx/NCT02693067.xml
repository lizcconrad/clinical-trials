  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine the safety, tolerability and reduction of biochemical
      markers (Chromogranin A or, if deemed appropriate, 5-hydroxyindoleaceticacid) and troublesome
      symptoms (particularly diarrhea and flushing) of intralesional injection of PV-10 in subjects
      with NET metastatic to the liver that are not amenable to resection or other potentially
      curative therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect on
      tumor growth and symptomology (clinical and biomarkers) following a single intralesional
      injection of PV-10 in subjects with neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver. Subjects
      will be divided into two cohorts (up to 6 subjects in each), the first of which will receive
      intralesional PV-10 to one liver lesion (to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10) to assess safety.
      If safety is established, cohort two will receive treatment to all amenable lesions (to a
      maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). Subjects can have further lesions treated 6 weeks after their
      initial treatment provided any preceding treatments with PV-10 were well tolerated.

             and Treatment of Cancer GI.NET21 instrument score of 2 or more at baseline) including:
