         18. Subject has history of an endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect
             osteogenesis.

         19. Subject has had treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following implantation of
             DTRAX Cervical Cage with DTRAX Bone Screw.
