  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of perioperative stroke in the non-cardiac, non-vascular, non-neurological high
      risk surgical population is 2%. It is higher (~5%) for cardiac surgery and carotid
      endarterectomy patients, with a stroke associated mortality of up to 60%. These patients
      could be immediately treated if their condition was detected on time. Currently, there is no
      standard brain monitoring procedure for anaesthetised patients. The purpose of the proposed
      study is to optimize and validate an online monitor for neurological deterioration under
      anaesthesia based on an easily operatable EEG system comprised of 4 electrodes, a reference
      electrode and a newely developed algorithm for analyzing the EEG signal. The monitor aims at
      generating an immediate warning at the onset of neurological deterioration. For the purpose
      of technology development with a minimal sample size, it is necessary to select a patient
      population that demonstrates significant neurological dynamics under anaesthesia. We will
      therefore focus on anesthesized patients undergoing neurovascular thrombectomy after CVA.

      The research aim is to validate a novel ground-breaking and easy-to-use EEG-based algorithm
      for sensing cerebrovascular accident (CVA) events under anaesthesia. Today there is no
      standard tool for CVA detection in anaesthetized patients. Thus the possibility of waking up
      from anaesthesia with severe brain damage is devastating. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      (such as valve replacement, CABG, thoracic aorta replacement, PTCA, TAVI (trans-aortic valve
      implantation)), carotid endarterectomy and surgery in sitting position, are at exceptionally
      high risk. We have developed a unique algorithm for detecting brain ischemia in anaesthetized
      patients, based on data acquired from 4 EEG electrodes. Our final goal is to develop a system
      that triggers an alarm when an ischemia occurs in an anaesthetized patient and during the
      peri-operative period.

      In order to validate and optimize our system, we require a small sample size to test and
      validate the technology. The population for this study includes patients with acute CVA who
      undergo mechanical thrombectomy under anaesthesia. Although these patients already have CVA,
      clinical dynamics is high in this population, and will enable a demonstration of our ability
      to recognize immediate changes in neurological status (improvement or deterioration).

      We believe this innovative EEG based system could be of major significance to millions of
      patients annually.
