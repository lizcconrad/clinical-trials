  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutropenia is the most serious hematologic toxicity of cancer chemotherapy, often limiting
      the doses and density of chemotherapy that can be tolerated. The degree and duration of
      neutropenia determine the risk of infection. Myelo001, a small orally bioavailable molecule,
      has been shown in chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced myelosuppression to stimulate
      differentiation of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) and bone marrow cells of the
      leucocytic, lymphocytic, and erythrocytic lineage. The purpose of the MyeloConcept study is
      to determine the safety and effectiveness of Myelo001 in preventing or reducing
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and myelosuppression in patients receiving chemotherapy due
      to breast cancer.

      Phase IIa study, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design,
      multi-center study. Each breast cancer patient will be randomly assigned into one of two
      treatment arms receiving either Myelo001 or placebo as a tablet. Investigational medicinal
      product is taken as supportive care for 23 consecutive days during chemotherapy treatment.
      Hematologic and safety parameters as well as actual begin and doses of following chemotherapy
      cycles will be assessed. A single primary variable will be analyzed with test statistics
      based on frequent absolute neutrophil measurements. Additionally, in a subgroup of patients
      biomarkers and pharmacokinetics of Myelo001 will be investigated.
