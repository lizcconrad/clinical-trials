  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to adapt and pilot test a type of therapy called Emotion Regulation
      Therapy (ERT-C) for informal caregivers of patients with cancer. Informal caregivers include
      partners, family members, children, parents, and friends providing informal care to a
      patient. Providing care to someone with cancer can be difficult. The purpose of this
      intervention is to improve coping and physical well-being among caregivers, which in turn
      will allow them to provide better care for their loved ones. Investigators would also like to
      learn about biological factors like stress that may affect one's emotional and physical
      well-being. This study will allow to better understand caregivers needs, and further develop
      a program to provide services to caregivers within MSKCC community and nationwide.

    <description>This study is a pilot, single-arm intervention of Emotion Regulation Therapy for Cancer Caregivers (ERT-C). We plan to recruit a pilot sample 32 consented (24 evaluable) caregivers of patients diagnosed with cancer and measure their distress, anxiety, and other psychological outcomes at baseline. Caregivers will be consented into an 8-session ERT-C therapy (approximately 12 - 16 weeks).</description>
