      Hip Muscle Strength in femoro-acetabular impingement participants versus normal controls.

      To investigate the hip muscle strength in a normal control group and compare this to patients
      who have a diagnosis of femoro-acetabular impingement (diagnosed clinically and with
      confirmed radiological features).

    <description>Participants aged 18-30, Male and Female (10 participants each). Control group must have normal range of movement and no evidence of femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) on clinical examination (negative impingement test, no symptoms).
