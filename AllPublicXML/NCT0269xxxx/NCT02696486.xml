    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is to develop and implement a pilot study that will demonstrate the
      ability to recruit, enroll, retain, conduct exercise training, and collect pre and post
      outcomes on the effect of exercise training on quality of life (QOL) and exercise capacity in
      patients with a diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).

    <measure>Change in exercise capacity/tolerance pre and post ET using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom limited treadmill testing with expired gas measurement and analysis. Exercise capacity measured as Peak Vo2 (peak exercise oxygen uptake) in ml/min/kg. Continuous monitoring of 12 lead electrocardiogram and blood pressure measured every 2 minutes. Peak Vo2 defined as highest Vo2 value of the last 30 seconds before termination of exercise. Exercise time and peak workload will be measured for exercise tolerance.</description>

          -  Ability to participate in exercise testing and training.

          -  Referral from Cardiologist or primary care physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable Angina
