  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase use and availability, as well as assess the
      feasibility of the ReliefLink (RL) application for use in conjunction with standard care to
      promote psychological health and prevent suicidal behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study of ReliefLink application are to determine the utility of ReliefLink
      self-reports of suicidal ideation, negative emotions, loneliness, subjective well-being,
      flourishing, mental toughness, positive emotions, learned optimism, resilience, and
      post-traumatic growth. Additional aims are to evaluate the impact of ReliefLink on perceived
      access to/usage of care and resources and to explore participant acceptance of ReliefLink as
      a technological support for standard treatment through human systems engineering of treatment
      plan adherence and user interview.

    <measure>Change in scores on 6 item Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Screener (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive, semi-structured interview measure that uniquely measures the full spectrum of suicidality including passive and active suicidal ideation, suicidal intent as well as suicidal behaviors. It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; A higher number of &quot;yes&quot; responses indicated an increased degree of suicidal ideation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on 20-item Positive-Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 10 positively and 10 negatively valanced word items. Items are rated by the participant for the extent they are feeling this &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 1- slightly or not at all through 5- extremely. Total scores can range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive effect and lower scores having negative effect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on 20-item R-UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item on a scale from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often). A higher score indicates an increased degree of loneliness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on 14-item Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 14 items and measures the degree of emotional well-being as defined in terms of positive affect/satisfaction with life; social well-being, social acceptance, social actualization, social contribution, social coherence social integration, psychological well-being, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Choices for these items vary between 1 to 7. Individuals who exhibit low levels (i.e., 'never' or 'once or twice' during the past month) on at least one measure of hedonic well-being and low levels on at least six measures of positive functioning are diagnosed with languishing mental health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on 12-item Flourishing Scale (FS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of the participant's self-perceived success in relationships, self-esteem, purpose, and optimism. Items are rated on a seven point rating scale from 1 Strongly disagree to 7 Strongly agree. The scale provides a single psychological well-being score. A lower score indicates a decreased degree of well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scores on 8-item Grit-S scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the individual's tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals. Eight items are assessed using a Likert-like scale (1 = Not like me at all, 5 = Very much like me). There are two sub-scales: Perseverance of Effort and Consistency of Interests. A lower score indicates a decreased decreased levels of perseverance and passion for long-term goals.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on 10-item Life Orientation Test - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures positive and negative expectancies about future events. It consists of 20 statements referring to negative expectancies and 10 statements referring to positive expectancies. Participants answer on a 5-point scale (5 = I agree a lot, 1 = I DISagree a lot). A lower score indicates a decreased degree of life orientation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures resilience. Range of scores (0-100). A score of 0 is suggestive of no resilience, a score of 100 is suggestive of high level of resilience.</description>
