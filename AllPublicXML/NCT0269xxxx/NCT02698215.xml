      This study is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial using a two group medication design
      consisting of the combination of VAR (1 mg twice daily) + NTX (50 mg once daily) and VAR (1
      mg twice daily) + PLA (matched to NTX), for smoking cessation in a sample of heavy drinking
      daily smokers who want to quit smoking and reduce drinking.

      mg twice daily) + PLA (matched to NTX), for smoking cessation in a sample of heavy drinking
      daily smokers who want to quit smoking and reduce drinking. All participants will be daily
      smokers (≥ 5 cig/day) who are also heavy drinkers according to the National Institute on
      Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines: for men, &gt; 14 drinks per week or ≥ 5 drinks
      per occasion at least once per month over the past 12 months; for women, &gt; 7 drinks per week
      or ≥ 4 drinks per occasion at least once per month over the past 12 months. A total of 274
      participants will be randomized, 137 to each medication group.
