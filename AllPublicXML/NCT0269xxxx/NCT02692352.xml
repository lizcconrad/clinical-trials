  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of Goal Management Training for
      patients with executive difficulties after acquired brain injury in a randomized controlled
      trial. The effect on cognitive functioning will be examined, as will the relationship between
      treatment effects and lesion location and size. The effect of Goal Management training on
      regulating emotions, quality of life and coping will be examined. The generalizability of
      treatment effects across etiologies will be explored by comparing effects in three patient
      groups; traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular accidents and resected brain tumors.
      Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and measures of white matter connectivity
      will be used to establish detailed lesion descriptions. Functional MRI data will provide
      information on the neural underpinnings of treatment related change. A secondary objective is
      to expand the Goal Management Training protocol with increased focus on emotional regulation
      and adherence to homework assignment.
