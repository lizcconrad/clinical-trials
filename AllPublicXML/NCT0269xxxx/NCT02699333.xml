  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microscopic colitis is a common cause of watery diarrhea, particularly in the elderly.
      Although the incidence is comparable to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the etiology
      is unknown. Understanding the etiology of microscopic colitis is an important step in
      developing logical interventions to decrease the burden from microscopic colitis. This
      research could provide critical insights into the etiology of this poorly studied condition.

      Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic condition that is a common cause of watery diarrhea,
      particularly in the elderly. The etiology is unknown but widely considered to be an abnormal
      immune reaction to luminal antigens in predisposed hosts. Drugs and autoimmunity have also
      been implicated. The aims of the study are: 1) To quantitatively classify microscopic colitis
      using image analysis microscopy to determine whether the degree of lymphocytic infiltration
      correlates with etiology, symptoms and prognosis. 2) To investigate the etiology of
      microscopic colitis by examining medical and lifestyle risk factors including medications,
      autoimmunity, diet, and smoking 3) To evaluate the association between the adherent microbial
      flora and MC to assess whether bacterial dysbiosis is linked to presence of MC. As an
      exploratory aim we will evaluate whether CYP2C19 polymorphisms are more common in purportedly
      drug-induced disease since the diverse drugs that have been associated with MC are all
      substrates for this gene.

      To conduct the study the investigators will obtain detailed dietary, medical and lifestyle
      information on study subjects who undergo complete colonoscopy for diarrhea. The
      investigators will obtain colon biopsies from the right, transverse and left colon to
      evaluate adherent bacterial organisms. The investigators will draw blood to evaluate CYP2C19
      polymorphisms and for future genetic studies. The prospective design corrects important
      limitations of prior research on MC. Successful completion of the study aims will improve the
      understanding of risk factors, set the stage for more scientifically grounded future
      research, and potentially suggest new interventions for a disease that is currently poorly
      understood.

      40 ml of blood centrifuged and separated into plasma, buffy coat and red blood cells. A serum
      separator tube will be used to collect an additional 10 ml of blood for serum.

      During colonoscopy, four mucosal biopsies will be obtained from normal appearing mucosa in
      the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending/sigmoid colon during the withdrawal
      phase of the exam from each patient (12 research biopsies). To improve orientation 2 biopsies
      from each segment will be flattened onto filter paper using a forceps and placed together
      into fixative. The remaining 2 biopsies from each area will be rinsed in sterile PBS to
      ensure there is no contamination with fecal bacteria prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen.
