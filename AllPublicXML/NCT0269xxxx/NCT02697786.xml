  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative brain damage and neuropsychological disorders have been observed in 30 - 80 %
      of patients after heart surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).They can persist
      up to a year after cardiac surgery and are associated with increased hospital mortality and
      prolonged intrahospital stay.

      Hypoperfusion,hyperthermia,atrial fibrillation,genetic predisposition and systemic
      inflammatory response associated with CPB have been identified as pathophysiological
      mechanisms.However, some authors consider cerebral embolisation to be the prevalent mechanism
      of intraoperative brain injury after cardiac surgery,as gaseous or solid cerebral emboli can
      cause ischemia, inflammation and edema,consequently causing cerebral infarctions usually
      resulting with stroke,coma,encephalopathy, delirium and cognitive decline. Additionally,they
      may impair cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).

      Aortic valve replacement (AVR) preformed by full sternotomy is the standard approach in the
      treatment of aortic valve disease. Minimally invasive (MIS) aortic valve replacement has been
      shown to reduce postoperative mortality, morbidity, and pain while providing faster recovery,
      a shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic results. However, due to technically more
      demanding procedure, MIS may lead to prolonged CPB time and incomplete de-airing of the heart
      with an increased risk for cerebral gas embolization. Therefore, the choice of MIS might bear
      an augmented risk for brain injury.

      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) enables real time detection of intraoperative emboli in the
      cerebral arteries seen as microembolic signals (MES), and is an essential neuromonitoring
      tool. Several studies demonstrated correlation between the number of MES and the occurrence
      as well as severity of postoperative neurological complications. However, the factors
      contributing to brain injury have not been elucidated in those studies. The investigators
      speculate that impairment of CVR is an important mechanism that persists and prolongs the
      duration of brain injury into postoperative period.

      The aim of the study is to compare two surgical approaches used for AVR, with focus on the
      number of MES and their impact on levels of protein S100B (marker of brain tissue
      damage),postoperative CVR and cognitive function With the results,the investigators aim to
      help surgeons in selecting the appropriate technique for AVR in individual participants,as
      well as to clarify the effect of aortic valve surgery on the brain.

      Patients undergoing for aortic valve replacement will be enrolled in the study after giving
      the signed informed consent and will be divided in two groups depending on the type of the
      surgical technique. Either full sternotomy (FS) or minimal invasive sternotomy (MIS) will be
      performed, both with the use of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB).One week before and one week
      after the surgery patients will undergo mini mental test and measurement of visually evoked
      cerebral blood flow velocity response (VEFR).Levels of S100B, interleukin (IL) 1, IL 6, IL 8,
      IL 10 and microparticles will be determined before induction of anesthesia,as well as 6 h, 24
      h, 48 h and 7 days after CPB.Each patient will have invasive and non invasive monitoring that
      will include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), bispectral index (BIS) and TCD during
      surgery.MES will be detected using TCD at the following time-points: beginning of surgery,
      after sternotomy, during aortic cannulation, during CPB, during de-airing, opening of the
      clamp on the aorta and after CBP removal before chest closure.All of this data will be
      documented as well as the demographic characteristics of patients, their preoperative medical
      status, and intraoperative data (duration of surgery, duration of CPB, hemodynamic
      parameters, inotropic/vasoactive support,blood and blood components); duration of mechanical
      ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), duration of ICU stay, 30-day mortality and
      morbidity, as well as postoperative complications.
