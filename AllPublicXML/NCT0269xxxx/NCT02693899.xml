  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in their classification and treatment, acute leukemia remain incurable
      disease for the majority of patients. It is necessary to identify new prognostic markers of
      survival and new therapeutic targets to improve prognosis. Some studies have shown that
      Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (FLT3-L) could be interesting from this. A more recent
      study from our group testing a novel therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showed an
      increase of this marker in the blood of patients responding to treatment. The aim of our
      prospective, non-interventional study is to measure the plasma levels of FLT3-L at different
      times of the management of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia but also myeloid. For
      this, analyzes of the samples collected in the usual care will be conducted to study the
      relationship between the plasma concentration of FLT3-L and outcomes. If there is any link,
      the FLT3-L could serve as a predictor of treatment response.

    <description>The samples of the study were made in conjunction with blood tests done routinely, no additional venipuncture is provided by the study. Flt3L plasma concentration will be measured at different time monitoring of patients according to their pathology (Acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia). The exact number of samples will vary for each patient depending on the course of the illness, it is expected up to 15 blood tubes 9mL.</description>
