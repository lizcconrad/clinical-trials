    <description>To assess the incidence of moderate to severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and of moderate to severe hypotension with ferumoxytol as compared to FCM. Signs and symptoms potentially representing hypersensitivity will be recorded and adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Anaphylaxis will be categorized based on the criteria of Sampson et al, 2006. Hypotension is defined as a 30% drop in systolic blood pressure.</description>
