  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Thermocool SF ® system is at least as
      effective and safe as regular 8mm catheters and irrigated tip catheters in the treatment of
      cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter.

    <textblock>
      The catheter of Biosense Webster Thermocool SF® is characterized by a porous, thin-walled tip
      allowing a uniform cooling of the catheter tip and so, achieving increased efficiency in
      cooling. This allows to reduce the flow of irrigation and power output while achieving
      similar tissue temperatures as the conventional irrigated catheters. There is evidence of
      greater efficiency of Thermocool SF® catheter in causing tissue damage, but there are no
      clinical studies on the specific treatment of common atrial flutter.

      Investigators hypothesize that the Thermocool SF® system is at least as effective and safe in
      the treatment of cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter as conventional and 8 mm
      irrigated tip catheters.

      150 patients with common atrial flutter were randomized to 3 groups of 50 patients and each
      group underwent ablation catheter ablation with CelsiusTMDS® 8 mm, 3.5 mm irrigated tip
      Thermocool® or Thermocool® SF respectively. After the procedure, patients are being followed
      by clinical reviews, electrocardiograms at the 3rd, 6th and 12th months, 24h ECG-Holter
      examination at the first and 6th month and monthly phone consultation. Rate of recurrence and
      presence of other supraventricular arrhythmias are being recorded during follow-up.
