    <description>Exotropia was treated with bilateral lateral rectus recession procedure. Lateral rectus recession was done. After lateral rectus recession, no degradable collagen implant was placed in the area, where lateral rectus was original inserted. One eye was randomly selected for the comparison.</description>
