      To evaluate the therapeutic evaluation of combination therapy with aspirin and salvianolate
      injection based on the population pharmacokinetics and TEG.A prospective, multicenter,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial is used.A total of 120 patients will be recruited and
      will be divided into three groups,respectively salvianolate injection group,aspirin group and
      salvianolate injection and aspirin group，and the course of treatment is 10 days.

           salvianolate group (n=40), the aspirin group(n=40) and the combination therapy group of

           infusion,0.2g/time, once a day; other routine treatment according to the condition of
           the disease.Aspirin group: aspirin, oral administration method,0.1g/time, once a day;
           other routine treatment according to the condition of the disease.Salvianolate injection
           and aspirin group: salvianolate injection, intravenously infusion,0.2g/time, once a day;
           aspirin, oral administration method,0.1g/time, once a day; other routine treatment

    <description>Thromboela-stogram(TEG) Is a reflection of the dynamic changes in blood coagulation (including the formation rate of fibrin, the dissolution of the state and the consistency of the solid, elastic degree) of the index: R time is the latency of the first fibrin plaque formation. K time is to assess the rate at which blood clots reach a certain level. The alpha angle is similar to the K time, but is more comprehensive than the K time, and is not affected by the low coagulation state. MA reflects the maximum amplitude of blood clots. CI is an integrated coagulation index.TPI is the index of platelet kinetics</description>
