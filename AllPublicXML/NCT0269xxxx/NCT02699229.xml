      For this study the investigators are looking to do the following:

        1. To characterize human lung lesions by nonlinear microscopy using ex vivo tissues.

        2. To establish the first spectral/structural database for nonlinear optical microimaging
           of normal and abnormal lung tissue.

      For this study the investigators are looking to do the following:

        1. To characterize human lung lesions by nonlinear microscopy using ex vivo tissues. In
           particular, to investigate collagen content and ultrastructure with SHG (second harmonic
           generation) microscopy, to characterize cell and nuclear morphology and lipid vesicle
           content with THG (third harmonic generation) and CARS (coherent anti-Stokes Raman
           scattering) microscopy and to conduct spectroscopic and lifetime characterization of MPF
           (multiphoton fluorescence) signals in cancerous, benign, and normal tissues.

        2. To establish the first spectral/structural database for nonlinear optical microimaging
           of normal and abnormal lung tissue, from which to generate diagnostic algorithms, both
           to optimize the operating parameters of planned nonlinear endoscopic imaging and to
           serve as the basis for nonlinear optical histopathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Patients with confirmed or suspected lung cancer who require lobectomy as part of
             standard-of-care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients deemed on clinical grounds not to be medically fit for a lobectomy

          -  Patients where there is a high clinical suspicion of lymphoma (to avoid mixing the
             data sets).

          -  Patients unable to give informed consent
