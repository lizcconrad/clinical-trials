  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study is the first step (a pilot study) in determining whether the
      manufacturer's recommended dose of a blood thinner called enoxaparin, in adults who are
      patients in an intensive care unit and have severely reduced kidney function (less than or
      equal to approximately 30% of their normal function) is safe with respect to the adverse
      effect of bleeding.

      The investigators hypothesis is that studying these patients, going forward in time, without
      interfering with their care, to eventually determine if this blood thinner is safe at reduced
      doses, is feasible.

      Objectives:

      To determine the feasibility of conducting a single centre, open-label, prospective study to
      inform preparation for a prospective phase III study evaluating the efficacy &amp; safety of
      enoxaparin prophylaxis in critically ill adults with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min.

      Study Design:

      A pilot open-label, single-arm, prospective study.

      Patients:

      Critically ill adults (&gt; 18 years) with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min.

      Setting:

      The Ottawa Hospital Intensive Care Units

      Sample Size: n=30.

      Intervention:

      Study patients will receive enoxaparin 30 mg S.C. daily for VTE prophylaxis as directed by
      their responsible Intensivist. The investigators are not directing this clinical intervention
      in any manner.

      Primary/Feasibility Outcomes: screening and enrolment rates with a goal of recruiting at
      least 5 patients collectively, from both ICUs, per month.

      Secondary/Clinical Outcomes: Determining the accumulation of anti-Xa concentrations, if any,
      recording of the rates of major bleeding, VTE, and HIT during the study.

      Trial Duration:

      Anticipated 24 months.

      Analysis:

      Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS software through the Ottawa Hospital Methods
      Centre. Patient demographics and clinical baseline characteristics will be described.
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean (SD), ordinal variables as medians (IQR) and
      categorical variables as proportions. Cox proportional hazards analysis will be used to
      evaluate an association between trough anti-Xa levels and major bleeding.
