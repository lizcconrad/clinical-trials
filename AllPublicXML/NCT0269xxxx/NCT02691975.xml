    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SHR3680 in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC). All participants will
      receive SHR3680.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgenic signaling plays a pivotal role in the development of prostate cancer. Androgen
      deprivation therapy is the mainstay treatment for this cancer in the metastatic setting, but
      the disease eventually develops to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) mainly due to
      the overexpression of androgen receptors (AR) and continued AR activation.

      SHR3680 is a novel strong AR antagonist. By competitively binding to AR, SHR3680 inhibits
      androgen-mediated translocation of AR to the nucleus, binding of AR to Deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA), and finally the transcription of AR target genes, thus possibly resulting in a
      specific and strong anti-tumor effect on prostate cancer. Unlike first-generation AR
      antagonists (e.g. bicalutamide), which undergoes an antagonist-to-agonist switch to stimulate
      AR in the setting of AR overexpression in CRPC, SHR3680 is a full antagonist of AR and thus
      it is supposed to be more effective for the treatment of CRPC.
