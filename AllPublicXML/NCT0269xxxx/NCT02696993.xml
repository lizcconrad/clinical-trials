    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this research study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose
      expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      nivolumab that can be given either with radiation therapy alone or in combination with
      radiation and ipilimumab, in patients with NSCLC. The goal of Part 2 of this study is to
      learn if the dose of nivolumab found in Part 1 when given with radiation therapy and
      ipilimumab can help to control the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Both WBRT and SRS radiation are FDA approved for local
      control of metastatic and primary tumors. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of melanoma and NSCLC. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to use
      radiation therapy, nivolumab, and ipilimumab to treat NSCLC. The study doctor can explain how
      the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 80 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Therapy:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      part (to learn which dose level of nivolumab you will receive) and to 1 of 2 study arms (to
      learn which treatment combination you will receive). This is done because no one knows if one
      study part is the same, better, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are enrolled in Arm A, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour every
           2 weeks and radiation therapy.

        -  If you are enrolled in Arm B, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes
           every 6 weeks, nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour every 2 weeks, and radiation therapy.

      The study doctor will decide which type of radiation therapy (either stereotactic
      radiosurgery [SRS] or whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT]) you will receive. If you receive
      SRS therapy, you will receive it 1 time. If you receive WBRT therapy, you will receive it 1
      time each day for 10 days.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1 of the study, the dose of nivolumab you receive will depend on
      when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the highest dose of
      nivolumab. If intolerable side effects are seen, the next group of participants will receive
      a lower dose.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2 of the study, the dose of nivolumab you receive will depend on
      the results seen in Part 1. The study doctor will tell you the dose of nivolumab you will
      receive.

      All participants will receive the same dose of ipilimumab and radiation therapy.

      Study Visits:

      Right before your first treatment and then over 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 1 month after you have received radiation:

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will complete the neurocognitive exam.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to receive the study drug(s) unless the disease gets worse, if you have
      intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You will only
      receive radiation therapy during the beginning of the study, either 1 time or for up to 10
      days.

      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may
      still be able to receive the study drug if you and your doctor decide it is in your best
      interest. Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drug is actually working.

      However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug(s) because the disease may
      actually be getting worse. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug(s).
      This could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may get worse to the point that
      you are no longer able to receive other treatments. The study doctor will discuss this option
      with you.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s), you will have a physical exam.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 12 weeks for up to 1 year:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will complete the neurocognitive exam.

      If the follow-up is done at another hospital, the information about your medical history,
      physical exam, routine blood tests, and imaging scans will be sent to MD Anderson for review.
      If you cannot come to MD Anderson for your follow up visits, the study team may call you
      every 12 weeks to ask how you are doing. Each call should last about 10 minutes.

             immunosuppressive agents will not be allowed on this study. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy are an exception to this rule. Subjects that require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections are not excluded from
             the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement are not excluded

             through routine medical management (e.g. thyroid replacement for hypothyroidism), are

             received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or
             complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. *Note: Subjects with
             &lt;/= Grade 2 amylase or lipase elevations abnormalities that have no corresponding
             clinical manifestations (e.g. manifestation of pancreatitis), are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study.

          5. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

             duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate,
             in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          9. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 31 weeks

             mutations.

         17. Allergies and adverse drug reaction to the following: History of allergy to study drug
             components; History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody

             restriction will be lifted in all subsequent cohorts of patients treated on part B.
