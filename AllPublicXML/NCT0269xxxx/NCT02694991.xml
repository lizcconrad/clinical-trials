    <textblock>
      Effectively controlling sternal pain during cardiac rehabilitation after heart surgery is
      very important as it reduces the risk of postoperative complications.

      However, the contraindications and side effects of analgesic drugs may induce physicians to
      use them so cautiously that pain may actually be under-treated.

      The aim of this open label, controlled study is to assess whether osteopathic manipulative
      treatment (OMT) can contribute to pain relief and improve rehabilitation outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The currently predominant means of controlling postoperative pain is the peri-operative
      administration of opioid or non-opioid (acetaminophen) analgesics, alone or in combination,
      and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, anti-inflammatory drugs are
      contraindicated for many patients because they may impair renal function, interact with
      platelet aggregation, and increase the risk of gastrointestinal damage and bleeding. The
      spectrum of available options is narrow.

      Osteopathic manipulative Treatment (OMT) intervenes in the process that transforms
      nociceptive information into the subjective experience and it may be useful.

      It has been found to be effective in controlling pain after abdominal surgery, it has a
      beneficial effect on patients recovering coronary artery by-pass surgery and also improves
      cardiac function The aim of this study was to assess whether complementary OMT is an
      effective means of reducing post-surgical sternal pain and improving rib cage mobility after
      heart surgery involving sternotomy, and to investigate its advantages during in-patient
      rehabilitation in terms of functional recovery, and perceived anxiety and depression.

      This open, randomised, semi-blinded, controlled trial involves inclusion of 80 adult patients
      of both genders consecutively admitted as in-patients to cardiac rehabilitation unit after
      undergoing elective coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG), valve replacement or repair
      and/or ascending aorta surgery with sternotomy, and capable of voluntarily providing their
      written informed consent. The patients are divided in 2 groups, the intervention group
      receiving OMT and the control group. Both groups are following the same rehabilitation
      programme and receiving usual care.

      All of the subjects taking part in the study are receiving standard care in accordance with
      the international guidelines for in-patient cardiac rehabilitation; the only experimental
      intervention is the addition of OMT

    <description>The thoracic wall is gently manipulated in conscious subjects in a supine position in order to facilitate greater diaphragmatic excursion. The thorax is palpated by applying a low pressure load directly on the skin in the direction of resistance, without any sliding over the skin or forcing of the subcutaneous tissue until it begins to yield and there is a sensation of softening. Sterile procedures are used when touching the patients near the surgical site. The treatment consists of a fixed and preordained sequence of three sessions, beginning with the costal arch on the diaphragm and then moving to the sternal area and, finally, the region of the thoracic outlet. The first two phases are performed from the right side, and the third from the head of the bed.</description>
