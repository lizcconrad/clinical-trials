      A single center, randomized, double blinded phase I/IIa exploratory study to evaluate
      reactogenicity, safety, immunogenicity and dose-response of a new hepatitis B vaccine in
      human adult

      -  Objectives: To explore the most effective dose of the third generation Hepatitis B
           vaccine through the evaluation of reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity.

        -  Subjects: Adults having anti-HBs antibody titers less than 10 mIU/mL after 3 previous
           injections of the conventional Hepatitis B vaccine.

        -  Study hypothesis: The third generation Hepatitis B vaccine, containing preS antigens in
           addition to S antigen, has an ability to elicit faster protection and higher antibody
           titers than the second generation Hepatitis B vaccine in the subjects.
