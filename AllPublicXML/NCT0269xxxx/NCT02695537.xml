  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Epidiolex at various
      doses between 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day as an additional (add-on) drug for treating
      debilitating, drug-resistant epilepsy.

      The specific goals of this phase I dose finding study conducted in consecutively enrolled
      patients 1-18 years of age are to prospectively and longitudinally assess the safety and
      tolerability, including cognitive effects, of CBD at various doses between 5 mg/kg/day and 25
      mg/kg/day with additional titration in some subjects up to 50 mg/kg/day. In order to
      participate in the study, participants will need to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      The goal of the study is to fulfill the mandate of &quot;Carly's Law&quot; and to provide patients with
      debilitating epileptic conditions with access to CBD as an add-on treatment. Other care
      including routine neurological care that is not related to participation in the CBD study
      will need to be provided by patients' primary/current treating neurologist.
