    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of 1,55 g/day of n-3 fatty
      acids from fish oil concomitant chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer.

      This study will be divided into three stages defined as: baseline (T0), middle moment (T1)
      and final moment (T2). At baseline, will be performer the patients identification, clinical
      data collection, assessment of anthropometric data and body composition, blood sample
      collection and questionnaires application for individuals allocated into two groups (Fish Oil
      Group and Placebo Group). The Fish Oil Group (GOP) will receive fish oil capsules and the
      placebo group (GP) will receive capsules containing olive oil, both also will receive
      consumption guidelines.

      The list of randomization was generated by a computer program and was divided by cancer
      localization and gender. The researchers involved with the recruitment had access only to
      randomization list containing codes. The codes were distributed sequentially.

      The baseline is the day of first chemotherapy. In the middle moment, five weeks after the
      start of study, new blood collection, questionnaires and measurement of anthropometric data
      will be performed. At the final moment, nine weeks after baseline, last blood collection,
      questionnaires and measurement of anthropometric data and body composition of fish oil and
      placebo groups will be performed, and will feature the end of the capsules consumption.

      After 6 months and 1 year after the initiation of chemotherapy and supplementation with fish
      oil or placebo, survival data will be collected.

      Throughout the monitoring period, the researcher and collaborators will maintain contact with
      the individuals included. The contact will be made in CEPON, where they receive chemotherapy,
      and by telephone.
