  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that domperidone suspension plus oral rehydration
      therapy (ORT) is more effective than placebo plus ORT at reducing the symptoms of vomiting
      associated with acute gastroenteritis (AG) within the first 48 hours of treatment
      administration in pediatric participants with AG and mild-to-moderate dehydration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter (when more than one hospital or
      medical school team work on a medical research study) study. The study consists of 3 Phases:
      Screening Phase (-2 to 0 hours prior to baseline on Day 1), Double-blind treatment Phase (up
      to 7 Days) and follow-up Phase (7 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each
      participant is at most 15 Days. Efficacy and safety of domperidone will be evaluated.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
