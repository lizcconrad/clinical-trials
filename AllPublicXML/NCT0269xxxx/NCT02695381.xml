        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have not engaged in significant upper extremity fitness activities for more than two
             times per week for â‰¥ 2 consecutive weeks in the past 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject has a body mass index of between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Subjects who report a pain with movement score in both arms of at least 5 (based on a
             0-10 NRS) secondary to DOMS approximately 24 to 30 hours after each arm was exercised.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of another painful physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may confound study assessments.

          -  Use of pain medication (including anti-inflammatory drugs) prior to the Exercise Visit
             until 72 hours after randomization.

          -  Use of any corticosteroids (oral, injectable, topical, inhaled) from before the
             Exercise Visit until randomization. Corticosteroids must be washed out by at least 3
             days before the Exercise Visit.

          -  Chronic or acute renal or hepatic disorder, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's
             disease or ulcerative colitis) or a significant coagulation defect.

          -  History of allergy (cutaneous or systemic), asthma, hypersensitivity to any of the
             following: etodolac, lidocaine, paracetamol (acetaminophen), acetylsalicylic acid,
             salicylic acid, other NSAID, other local anesthetic, known intolerance (cutaneous or
             systemic) to any of the ingredients in the patch.
