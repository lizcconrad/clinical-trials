      The main objectives of the trial are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of U3-1784 in patients with advanced solid
           tumours

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and or establish the safety and
           tolerability of the maximum administered dose (MAD) of U3-1784

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumours
             refractory to, intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who decline
             standard therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available

          -  Part 2: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC refractory to,
             intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who decline standard
             therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available. If emerging Part 1
             data suggest that a particular tumour type or specific tumour histology might be
             responsive to treatment, then patients with this tumour type or histology will also be
             included in Part 2 of the study.

          -  Male or female patients, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment.

          -  Males and females of childbearing potential are permitted in the study so long as they
             consent to avoid getting their partner pregnant or becoming pregnant, respectively, by
             using a highly effective contraception method, as described below, throughout the
             study and for up to 90 days after completion. Highly effective methods of
             contraception include: hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation,
             intrauterine device; surgical sterilization (including partner's vasectomy) or sexual
             abstinence, if this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Women of
             non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or
             have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
             status ≤ 1.

             measurable lesion in HCC patients should not be one that has been previously treated
             by loco-regional therapies (e.g. TACE, RFA) unless this lesion has progressed and
             there is evidence of new, measurable, enhancement on dynamic imaging.

          -  Patient has 1 of the following available for pharmacodynamic analyses:

          -  Archived diagnostic or freshly obtained formalin-fixed paraffin embedded or frozen

          -  Total Bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT): ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN

             creatinine using Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≥ 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine
             levels above institutional normal

          -  Patient has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonal, biologic, or any investigational therapy or loco-regional

          -  Patient has had major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment.

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to colestyramine (or any of its excipients) or
