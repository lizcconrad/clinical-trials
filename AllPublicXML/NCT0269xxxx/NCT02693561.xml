    <textblock>
      Smoking is an important public health issue. The self help books may have important
      motivational implications which associated with deep breath exercises could cease the habit.
      Goals: Verify the effectiveness of the deep breaths exercises from the self help books along
      with the two motivational interventions to quit smoking on the anxiety, depression and daily
      consumption levels. Method: The study will be both prospective and controlled. Individuals
      will be distributed randomly in 4 different groups: The first group will be doing the deep
      breath exercises, the second group will read a self help book, the third group will do both
      reading and exercises and the fourth group will be the control. Anxiety, depression,
      motivational level and the cigarettes daily consumption will be evaluated previously and
      after the 15 days intervention. Expected results: Decreasing in anxiety, depression and
      cigarette consumption plus an increase in the motivation to quit smoking.

      Smoking is a major public health problem. According to the WHO (World health organization)
      it's considered a pandemic issue which kills around 5 million people from related diseases.

      This is a growing problem in all South American countries specially where poverty and the
      lack of instruction make people more vulnerable to the addiction. In addition, the smoking
      habit has been integrated to these countries cultures because of their economical dependence
      of it and ostensive marketing.

      However, nowadays smoking harm effects are well known including the high risk of developing
      COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), heart diseases and many other forms of
      neoplasms.

      The problems concerning smoking were first documented 40 years ago and are still one of the
      major causes of death which could be prevented. The medical costs associated with its
      treatment go far beyond the economical benefits from producing and commercializing tobacco.

      It's estimated that in 2025, there will be 10 million people dying from tobacco consumption
      if the world panorama stays as it is. 90% of the teenagers who starts smoking become addicted
      by they are 19 years old.

      According to the Smoking cessation guidelines - 2008 to stop smoking the addiction is
      recognized as a chronic condition and the interventions to change habits tends to be repeated
      as it's hard to get a efficient treatment. Even though, the stop smoking is associated in an
      increase of life quality and that's why it should be stimulated.

      Three main mechanisms influence smoking, the first one is positive reinforcement, which is
      related to the release of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA in the nervous
      central system caused by the action of nicotine that reduces appetite, improves mood and
      concentration and generate feelings of pleasure. The second is negative reinforcement, which
      generates the maintenance of cigarette use to prevent the symptoms of withdrawal symptoms
      like anxiety, increased appetite, dysphoria, irritability and difficulty in concentrating.
      The third is the respondent conditioning, which is stimulated by environmental factors,
      negative emotions and positive that lead to the act of smoke. Thus smoking is a complex
      behavior that is related to lifestyle, while trying to quit smoking many individuals
      experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome which is a major cause of relapse. Deep breathing
      technique is cited by smokers as a strategy to alleviate these symptoms abstinence.

      Mcclernon et al. They found results suggesting that guided deep breathing exercises relieve
      the symptoms of abstinence nicotine.

      According to Tharion et al. deep breathing decreases respiratory rate and increase the
      variability of heart rate, stimulates the autonomic parasympathetic nervous system and
      increase the relaxing substances such as endorphins, so it is recommended as a relaxation
      technique, as well as decreasing tension, anger and depression.

      Initially, in addition to clinical assessment of the smoker and assessing the degree of
      dependence, to assess the degree of motivation is fundamental to start therapy approach.

      Prochaska and Diclemente described a stage of readiness model for change (motivation), with
      the steps of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance (prevent
      the return behavior, undertaking measures to prevent relapse). First described as a linear
      model and later as a spiral model, since patients often have relapses, and remain long
      periods in maintenance stage.

      Thus, motivational interventions are critical in smoker's approach in all clinical
      situations, even when participants need medical support. The self-help books can be effective
      and have important implications for public health. These psycho-educational interventions are
      complex and usually contains multiple components that interact and involve behavioral changes
      of people.

      Self-help materials, according to Song et.al., can be effective and less costly than
      individual therapy or group sessions, which for many people is hard to get. Currently there
      are materials available in audio, video and computer programs, though the writings are the
      most commons.

      A literature review by Boyce et al. And published by the Cochrane Library, concluded that
      materials that are tailored individually, eg for pregnant women or young, are more effective
      than non-adapted materials and both are effective for smoking cessation compared to
      individuals who did not use the self help material.

      In this review, there was no additional benefit of evidence of the use of self-help material
      associated with other interventions such as advice from a health professional or replacement
      therapy nicotine and no selected study in the review used the deep breathing technique
      associated with reading self help material.

      However, such evidence is tested in developed countries and more research is needed to
      investigate its effects in countries where support to smokers are not easily available.

      Polonio I.B et al. , Published in 2013 a self-help book with smokers auxiliary order
      containing the principles of behavioral intervention conducted on Santa Casa de Sao Paulo
      smoking clinic.

      Finally, the hypothesis of the study is that the book will be an effective tool to reduce
      anxiety, depression and increased motivation to quit smoking, the investigators believe that
      the addition of deep breathing to read the book will enhance these effects.

    <description>Scale developed by Prochaska and DiClemente, translated and validated to Portuguese used to measure the motivation to change. Determines different motivational stages in solving a problem. To classify the individual in the pre-contemplation stage (stage where the person does not consider the need for help), contemplation stage (the individual is aware of the problem), preparation stage (construction of attempts to change their behavioraction stage (taking concrete attempts to modify their behavior) and maintenance stage (the lifestyle is modified). The answers are given on a scale of 1 (completely disagree with the statement) to 5 (strongly agree). Each statement is linked to a different motivational stage and at the end of test, the investigators can determine which is the patient motivational level considering which stage his score was higher.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by Karl-Olov Fagerstrom, translated and validated for the Portuguese to be aware related to biochemical index enabling the classification of nicotine addiction as mild, moderate and severe. It consists of six items that help to estimate the degree of nicotine dependence. Each item features a score from 0 to 3 according to the response and the sum of the scores of the alternatives chosen classifies the degree of dependence. The total less than 2 points classifies a very low level of dependence, from 3 to 4 points classifies the low degree of dependence, 5 points classifies the average degree of dependence, 6 to 7 point classifies the high degree of dependence 8 to 10 points ranks very high degree of dependence.</description>

    <description>Self-assessment measure of depression developed by Beck translated to Portuguese and validity. Consists of 21 items, including symptoms and attitudes, each with four alternatives with intensity going from 0 to 3.The items refer to sadness, pessimism, sense of failure, lack of satisfaction, guilty, sense of punishment, self-deprecation, self-accusations, suicidal ideas, crying spells, irritability, social withdrawal, indecisiveness, body image distortion, inhibition to work, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, somatic concern. To evaluate and rank, according to the symptoms presented last week, the state of depression according to the sum of the scores of the chosen alternative. Total &lt;10 points (without depression); 10-18 (mild to moderate depression); 19-29 (moderate to severe depression) and 30-63 (severe depression).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety measured with the Portuguese version of the &quot;BAI&quot; ( The Beck Anxiety Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale developed by Beck, translated and validated to Portuguese. It consists of 21 items that measure anxiety. The subject must answer how bothered he is with anxiety symptoms during the last week. The criteria for correction of scores constitute a scale of 0 to 3 points for each symptom (absolutely no = 0; 1 = slightly, moderately = 2; seriously = 3). The sum of the scores can range from 0 to 63 points. Therefore, the results differ in the degree of anxiety: minimum 0-10; mild-11-9; moderate level of 20 to 30 and severe level 31-63.</description>

    <description>Technical Deep Breathing: Deep breathing is to deep breath and slowly through the nostrils until total lung capacity. At the end of inspiration is kept a few seconds of apnea and started after the expiration slowly. End-expiratory apnea will remain a few seconds to start new inspiration cycle. With this process the individual breathe about 6 times per minute. Breath learning occurs through visual feedback. In the intervention group will be held deep breathing for 10 minutes. Subjects will be instructed to deep breath for 10 minutes 2 times a day for 15 days beyond the period in which they cleft, which is one of the symptoms of withdrawal syndrome. Control and frequency of deep breathing will be obtained weekly through specific daily fill, which will be provided weekly.</description>
