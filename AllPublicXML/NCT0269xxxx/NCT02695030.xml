    <textblock>
      The MicroVention Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS*) Device is intended for
      use with bare platinum embolic coils for the treatment of unruptured, wide neck (neck greater
      than or equal to 4 or a dome to neck ratio less than two), intracranial, saccular aneurysms
      arising from a parent vessel with a diameter of greater than or equal to 2.5mm and less than
      or equal to 4.5mm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wide neck aneurysms are very difficult to treat both surgically and endovascularly with
      clipping or coiling. The availability of this neurovascular flow diverter as a Humanitarian
      Use Device has provided an additional approach to aneurysm occlusion using endovascular
      techniques.
