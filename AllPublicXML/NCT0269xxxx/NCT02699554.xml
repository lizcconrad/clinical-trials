  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired neuromuscular control hinders movement for individuals with cerebral palsy and other
      neurological disorders. In this research, the investigators are developing new tools to
      quantify impaired neuromuscular control in cerebral palsy and evaluate changes after one of
      the most common treatments, orthopaedic surgery. The results from this research will empower
      clinicians to identify patient-specific factors that contribute to impaired movement and
      improve treatment and quality of life.

      The long-term goals of this research are to quantify patient-specific changes in
      neuromuscular control in order to optimize treatment planning and improve mobility for
      individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). As a first step, the aims of this proposal are to
      evaluate neuromuscular control before and after one of the most common treatments for
      individuals with CP, orthopaedic surgery. The investigators will evaluate if patient-specific
      measures of neuromuscular control, based upon the framework of muscle synergies, can predict
      improvements in walking ability after surgery. Further, investigators will determine whether
      neuromuscular control changes after surgery and if these changes contribute to improvements
      in movement. To achieve these goal the investigators will implement and test new tools to
      quantify neuromuscular control which integrate clinical gait analysis and two computational
      techniques: synergy analysis and dynamic musculoskeletal simulation. This research will
      provide the foundation to use measures of altered neuromuscular control to inform treatment
      planning, develop alternative treatments, and improve mobility in CP and other neurologic
      disorders.

    <description>The Walk Dynamic Motor Control Index (Walk DMC) is a specific measurement calculated from electromyography during gait using nonnegative matrix factorization. A value of 100 indicates complexity of neuromuscular control similar to typically-developing peers and each 10 point deviation represents one standard deviation from typically-developing peers. Thus, a value of 80 would indicate that an individual's muscle coordination during gait is two standard deviations below the complexity of unimpaired individuals. For full methods used to calculate Walk DMC please see: Steele, K. M., Rozumalski, A., &amp; Schwartz, M. H. (2015).

    <description>The Gait Deviation Index is a specific measurement which uses kinematics measured from instrumented gait analysis to compare an individual's gait pattern to typically-developing controls. A value of 100 indicates kinematics similar to unimpaired individuals while each 10 point deviation represents one standard deviation from unimpaired gait. Thus, a value of 80 would indicate that an individual's gait kinematics are on average two standard deviations from unimpaired gait. Reference: Schwartz, M. H., &amp; Rozumalski, A. (2008).
