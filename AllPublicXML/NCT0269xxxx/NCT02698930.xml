  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is major complication after open heart surgery. The cause of acute kidney
      injury following open heart surgery is related to activation of sympathetic nervous system,
      decrease of renal blood flow, ischemia-reperfusion injury and systemic inflammatory response.

      Infective endocarditis patients undergoing open heart surgery have systemic inflammatory
      response associated with infective endocarditis. And the inflammatory response can be
      aggravated by cardiopulmonary bypass. The incidence of acute kidney injury following open
      heart surgery due to infective endocarditis was 50% in a previous report. And this acute
      kidney injury was related to the poor outcome and high mortality. Thus, the preventive method
      to protect kidney function will be needed in the patients with infective endocarditis
      undergoing open heart surgery.

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective Î±2-agonist and has sedative, analgesic, and CNS depressive
      effect. And several experimental study demonstrated the renal protective effect.
      Intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration can reduce the amount of anesthetics needed and
      suppress the sympathetic response resulted by surgical stimulation. And dexmedetomidine was
      reported to reduce the level of serum cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine during the
      operation. Thus, these effects of dexmedetomidine can be expected to reduce the incidence of
      acute kidney injury.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that dexmedetomidine has renal protective effect
      and this effect might be related to the suppression of inflammatory response. Thus, the
      investigators will evaluate the incidence of acute kidney injury and the incidence of major
      adverse kidney events (MAKE) after open heart surgery due to infective endocarditis and the
      level of inflammatory mediators.

      The primary end point of this study is the incidence of acute kidney injury after open heart
      surgery due to infective endocarditis. And secondary end point is the incidence of MAKE, the
      level of cystatin C which is related to the renal function, the level of inflammatory
      mediator and the postoperative morbidities.
