    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4
      inhibition on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB074. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 when co-administered with a strong
      CYP3A4 inhibitor and to assess the effect of CYP3A4 inhibition on the PK of 3 metabolites of
      BIIB074 (CNV3000497 [M13], CNV2283325 [M14], and CNV2288584 [M16]).
