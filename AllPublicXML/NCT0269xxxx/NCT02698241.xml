      The INTERVENE-HF study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (US only),
      investigational, feasibility study. The purpose of this study is to characterize safety of
      managing heart failure patients with integrated device diagnostics that have an implanted
      commercially available Medtronic cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D).

      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 20 centers located in the United States. Up to
      400 subjects will be enrolled to yield up to 200 eligible subjects that meet screening
      criteria. This study will be conducted in subjects with an implanted, commercially available,
      Medtronic, CRT-D device. Each enrolled subject will be followed every 2 months from time of
      enrollment to end of the study.The study will end after the last enrolled subject completes
      the 12-month follow-up.
