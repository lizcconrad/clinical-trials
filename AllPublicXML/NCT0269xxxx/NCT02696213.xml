  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systematic, Comprehensive, One-to-One Training (SCOOT) for Scooter Skills, is a novel,
      community-based, client-centred intervention where skills training is incorporated into
      social activities that users want to perform. The trainer also offers problem solving
      strategies to help manage environmental barriers and to promote social participation. This
      intervention is different from customary scooter training in that customary training is often
      very limited and focuses on learning discrete skills outside of the user's normal
      environment. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a
      mixed-methods, rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) for new scooter users, which
      will evaluate the efficacy of SCOOT. We anticipate that the feasibility outcomes will be
      strong enough to support the conduct of a subsequent multi-site trial with a sufficient
      sample size to enable us to quantify definitive outcomes such as adverse events (e.g.,
      injuries and abandonment).

    <time_frame>Change from baseline skill level at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The WST-ScQ measures the participant's subjective scooter skills (capacity), and inquires on the frequency the skill is performed, and whether or not improvement of the skill is a personal goal.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The WST-Sc consists of 29 skills that are scored by an examiner from 0 to 2, where 0 = unsafe or unable, 1 = safe with difficulty, and 2 = safe without difficulty</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The WST-ScQ measures the participant's subjective scooter skills, and inquires on the participant's scooter skill confidence, frequency the skill is performed (performance), and whether or not improvement of the skill is a personal goal.</description>

    <measure>Wheeled Mobility Outcome Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This measure evaluates indoor and outdoor participation levels associated with wheeled mobility provision by using an 11 point scale (0 = completely unsatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Space Assessment (LSA) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The LSA measures participants' frequency and independence of mobility in increasingly larger life spaces over the past month.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scooter Use and Incidents</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to keep a diary of any scooter-related adverse events, including the following: tips or falls from the scooter, injuries to self, accidental contact with others, injuries to others, and damage to property. Participants will be asked to record the number of hours per day that they use their scooters.</description>
