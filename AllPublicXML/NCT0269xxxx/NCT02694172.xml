  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the clinical trial is to investigate whether overweight type 2 diabetic
      patients have a different fecal microbiota profile compared with age, gender, BMI matched
      subjects and with lean healthy subjects before and after the consumption of fiber rich cereal
      bars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota refers to the bacterial communities in the gastrointestinal tract. The
      diversity and quantity of bacteria vary depending on age of the individuals, daily diet and
      the segment of the intestine, which makes the gut microbiota one of the most complex
      bacterial ecosystems known to men. In general, over trillions of bacteria reside in human
      gut. Recent evidence indicates that gut microbiota could be involved in host metabolism by
      multiple pathways leading to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Increased fat
      storage or obesity has become one of the leading public health issues in many developed and
      developing countries. However, it is not clear whether type 2 diabetes is associated with a
      unique gut microbiota profile. Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to compare
      the fecal microbiota of overweight type 2 diabetic subjects to that of age, gender and BMI
      matched subjects as well as with lean non-diabetic subjects. In addition, the investigators
      hypothesize that microbiota modifications with consumption of fiber rich food products can
      improve the metabolic outcomes of type 2 diabetics. To test this hypothesis, the
      investigators plan to provide each overweight participant with two cereal bars per day for 4
      weeks. Anthropometric measurements and plasma parameters as well as the fecal microbiota will
      be determined.
