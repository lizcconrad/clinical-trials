      This observational study compares the health and social outcomes between opioid-dependent
      individuals who are either recently released from a compulsory drug detention center (CDDC)
      or recently discharged from a voluntary treatment center (VTC) providing methadone
      maintenance therapy, in Malaysia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In July 2010, the National Anti-Drug Agency of Malaysia (NADA) introduced a non-punitive
      system of treatment and care for people who use drugs, voluntary treatment centers (VTCs),
      called 'Cure &amp; Care' clinics, offering free methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) to
      opioid-dependent drug users. These centers were opened alongside existing compulsory drug
      detention centers (CDDCs), where people who use drugs continue to be detained involuntarily
      without access to evidence-based treatment. Given that both of these programs are operated by
      NADA but espouse vastly different responses to drug use, we compared health and social
      outcomes between opioid-dependent individuals recently released from CDDCs and recently
      initiated into MMT in the new VTCs.
