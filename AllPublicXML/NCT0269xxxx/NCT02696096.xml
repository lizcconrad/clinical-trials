  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to observe brain
      activity and behavior associated with decision-making about rewards (DD task), working memory
      and working memory cognitive persistence (WM task), and craving (CR task) in 72 opiate
      dependent participants initiating buprenorphine. While stably using opiates (initial study
      appointment) and again during withdrawal (approximately 3 days later), participants will
      receive an FMRI scan with behavioral challenges; immediately after the second FMRI, they will
      receive their first dose of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine treatment will continue for twelve
      weeks, followed by a four week taper. Urine toxicological analysis will be performed prior to
      the first scanning session, weekly for two weeks and biweekly thereafter.

      Participation for all individuals will last 4 months. Assessments will occur at baseline, and
      weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Buprenorphine induction will begin at the completion of the second
      scan; follow-up medical visits will align with study assessments on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12.
      All participants will receive 16 weeks of buprenorphine (the final 4 of these 16 weeks will
      include a taper).
