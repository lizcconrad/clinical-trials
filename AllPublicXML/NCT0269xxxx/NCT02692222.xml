    <textblock>
      This study test the agreement and accuracy of Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) and Cardiac
      Output (CO) obtained by the Android application Capstesia™ against the gold standard : PPV
      and CO calculated by thermodilution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulse pressure variation (PPV) remains a good predictor of fluid responsiveness in the OR.
      However, PPV can be time-consuming to calculate (manual determination), is not always
      displayed on monitoring screens nor reliable through visual assessment and needs additional
      devices to be displayed. A new Android application (Captesia) automatically calculates the
      PPV utilizing a digital photograph of the arterial waveform from the monitor. The application
      determines the PPV by selecting peaks and troughs of the arterial curve.
