      This study is to assess the efficacy of Neihulizumab versus &quot;conventional therapy&quot; and to
      evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in treating steroid-refractory acute
      Graft-vs-Host Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This current Phase II trial is a randomized, open label, controlled, multiple dose,
      multi-centre study to study the clinical efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab vs &quot;Conventional
      Treatment&quot; to treat steroid-refractory acute graft-vs-host disease (sr-aGvHD) in patients
      undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      This study will enroll a minimum of 90 patients, approximately 60 in Neihulizumab treatment
      arm and 30 in Conventional treatment control arm.

      The primary objectives is to evaluate the efficacy of Neihulizumab treatment in patients with
      steroid-refractory acute GvHD compared to &quot;conventional treatment.&quot; The secondary objectives
      are to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of Neihulizumab
      administration in subjects with steroid-refractory acute GvHD.

      For safety evaluation, the parameters to be assessed are adverse events (AEs),
      discontinuation of therapy due to AEs, safety laboratory analysis, ECG, vital signs, physical
      examination, and immunogenicity.

    <description>Patients will receive a total of 4 doses of Neihulizumab (AbGn-168H) on Day 1 (Week 0), Day 8 (Week 1), Day 15 (Week 2), and Day 22 (Week 3) by 1-hour i.v. infusion.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a 2nd line therapy for aGvHD at the discretion of attending physician according to the standard practice at the study center. Currently there is no treatment for sr-aGvHD is approved in USA or Europe. There is no Standard treatment of this disease is recommended by American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT). Therefore, the study is designed to allow any established institutional practice for off-label use of a commercially available product for patients in the Conventional Treatment arm. Patients in this arm may receive treatments provided in ASBMT guidance such as ATG, TNF-alpha inhibitors (such as Etanercept and infliximab), pentostatin, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and extracorporeal photopheresis, methotrexate, basiliximab, daclizumab, inolimomab, denileukin diftitox, alemtuzumab, ATG+ etanercept, Dacliz + etanercept, Dacliz+ infliximab, and Dacliz/inflix/horse ATG.</description>
