  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) suffer from dyspnoea, which may be
      exacerbated by psychological outcomes including anxiety and depression. Previous studies
      suggest that relaxation techniques may have positive effects on pulmonary rehabilitation. The
      main aim of this study is to explore both the respiratory and psychological impact of a
      quick, one-session, relaxation training for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD).
