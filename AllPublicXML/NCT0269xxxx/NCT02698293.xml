  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation study of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of
      patients with pre-malignant tumors and superficial microinvasive disease of the anal canal
      and/or perianal skin. All subjects (a maximum of 12) will be given the photosensitizer
      Gliolan orally followed by the administration of red light (629-635 nm) to the tumor from a
      laser. The dose of Gliolan will be 40 mg/kg administered approximately 4-6 hours before light
      administration. There will be two levels of light dose: 50 and 100 J/cm2, 3-6 patients in
      each. Patients will be observed for 30 days for the development of DLT. Patients will be
      followed up for 24 months for additional toxicity and efficacy data collection.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histological or cytological diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in-situ,
             within past 4 months.

          -  Premalignant lesions containing focal microinvasion are eligible when:

          -  Surgery is not clinically mandated.

          -  Subjects with medical conditions precluding surgery.

          -  Subjects whose lesions cannot be completely resected based on size or location, or
             where significant functional morbidity would be anticipated with further surgery.

          -  Patients refuse surgery.

          -  The justification for inclusion of patients with microinvasive disease is based
             reports demonstrating the ability of photodynamic therapy to successfully treat both
             dysplasia and T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (22).

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Study subjects capable of providing informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Study subjects in whom the lesion has invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anal
             cavity which is clinically appreciable.

          -  Clinically occult microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anal cavity which is
             not focal.

          -  Study subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Study subjects who have a platelet count of less than 100,000/cubic mm.

          -  Study subjects with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin levels &gt;2X normal or
             a history of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis of the liver.

          -  Significant cardiovascular history that would put the study subject at risk from
             hypotension that may occur with Gliolan

          -  Study subjects with porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrins.

          -  Study subjects with abnormal baseline creatinine level or diagnosed kidney disease.

          -  Study subjects who have a medical history of immune suppression. This will include
             patients with a past transplantation requiring ongoing immunosuppressive medications.
             Patients with HIV infection are eligible provided they are on highly active
             anti-retroviral therapy and their most recent CD4 count is &gt;200
