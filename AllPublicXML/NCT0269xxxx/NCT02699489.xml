      A phase III randomized trial conducted to compare recovery outcomes between laparoscopic and
      open donor nephrectomy within a specified enhanced recovery protocol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MEnROL trial is a phase III randomized controlled trial of Open versus Laparoscopic donor
      nephrectomy within a standardized enhanced recovery program. Eligible donors were randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio.

      Laparoscopic procedures are performed by a single surgeon (AMM) while Open donor
      nephrectomies (ODN) were performed by an experienced team that included the laparoscopic
      surgeon. ODN were performed via a supracostal incision above the 11th rib and an
      extra-pleural extra-peritoneal approach was adopted. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) was
      performed via a standard 4-port distribution. Control of the hilar vessels was performed
      using extra-large Hem-o-Lok clips (Weck- Covidien, Research Triangle Park, NC) and graft
      extraction was performed via a pre-prepared Pfannenstiel incision.

      Donors are enrolled in our enhanced recovery program for donor nephrectomy. The program was
      compliant with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Group (ERAS) guidelines. All donors
      receive epidural analgesia and are maintained on non-narcotic postoperative analgesics.
      Criteria for hospital discharge include ambulation, adequate pain control with oral
      analgesics, and sustained intake of solid food.
