      A single center, open labeled phase I/IIa study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of a therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine in oral antiviral drug-treated chronic hepatitis B virus
      carriers

      -  Objectives: To explore the appropriate dose of a therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine through
           the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy

        -  Subjects: Chronic hepatitis B carrier with normal ALT range

        -  Study hypothesis: The immune tolerance break and strong immune responses in the chronic
           hepatitis B carrier could be achieved with therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine containing
           novel adjuvant
