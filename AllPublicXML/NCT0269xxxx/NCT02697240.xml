  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a genetic red blood cell disorder characterized by vaso-occlusion from
      sickling of red blood cells, that can lead to pain or organ complications such as acute chest
      syndrome. Sickle cell disease is associated with low amounts of nitric oxide, a compound
      important for dilating the blood vessel wall. Citrulline is a substance that is known to
      increase nitric oxide. The goal of this Phase I study are to find the highest safe dose of
      continuous IV citrulline that can be given to individuals with sickle cell disease
      experiencing a sickle cell pain crisis or acute chest syndrome without causing severe side
      effects.
