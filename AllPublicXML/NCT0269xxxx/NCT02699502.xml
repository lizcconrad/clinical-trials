      Osteoporotic hip fractures are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older age.
      Patients with this fracture are at high risk of further fracture, it can be reduced by
      appropriate metabolic therapy. However, only 30% of patients after a hip fracture receive
      basic treatment appropriate calcium and vitamin D, only 10-15% receive complementary
      metabolic therapy more drugs prevent bone resorption, or bone-building drugs as recommended
      in the literature, the prevention of further fractures. studies conducted in the past have
      proven, multi-disciplinary team of dedicated financial institution may increase appropriate
      treatment and improve the quality of care in these patients.

      Previous data in our institution has shown that 84% of patients with hip fractures received
      calcium and vitamin D during hospitalization, but only 47% of the patients came to the
      metabolic clinic. Moreover, of the patients who came to the metabolic clinic, only 46% were
      put on complementary metabolic therapy, mostly due to a lack of sufficient vitamin D level.
      In the present study investigators attempt to treat patients without physical attendance at
      the metabolic clinic.

    <description>The intervention includes matching an appropriate drug to patients with hip fractures. All the relevant parameters regarding the patients with osteoporotic hip fractures will be reviewed (age, kidney function, previous treatment) and an appropriate anti osteoporosis medication will be determined. A recommendation regarding treatment will be sent to the local regulatory authorities, which will send the approved recommendation the the family physician.</description>
