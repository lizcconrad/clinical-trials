        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any trial specific procedures

          -  Male or female subjects between 18 to 75 years

          -  A diagnosis of stable mild to moderate inverse psoriasis (i.e. axillae, the infra- and
             intermammary, genital, scrotum, abdominal and retroauricular folds; the intergluteal
             cleft and perianal skin, in addition to neck or other skin folds). Mild to moderate is
             defined as having at least score 1 for each individual sign thickness and redness, and
             total TSS score of at least 5.

          -  The total treatment area can be up to 4% BSA (720 cm2).

          -  Subjects must have a history of psoriasis, or have psoriasis, or present with
             characteristic psoriasis leasons elsewhere on the body (including the scalp) at Visit
             1 (Screening)

          -  Stable inverse psoriasis based on TSS evaluated at Visit 1 (Screening) and at Visit 2
             (Start of treatment), which must not differ more than 1 point in any single clinical
             sign score (redness, scaling and thickness)

          -  Except for inverse psoriasis, overall good health including well controlled diseases
             (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease) as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate
             and body temperature) and clinical laboratory evaluation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are breastfeeding or pregnant

          -  Severe chronic inverse psoriasis, or psoriasis on the body (&gt;30% of BSA)

          -  Current diagnosis of acute guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis

          -  Signs of viral (e.g. herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, or signs of clinically
             active fungal or bacterial infection in any of the inverse psoriasis areas, as judged
             by the investigator

          -  Use of biological therapies (marketed/not marketed) with a possible effect on inverse
             psoriasis within 4 weeks (etanercept), 8 weeks (adalimumab, alefacept, infliximab), 16
             weeks (ustekinumab, secukinumab) or 4 weeks/5 half-lives (whichever is longer) for
             experimental biological products prior to Visit 2 (Start of treatment)

          -  Use of systemic treatments (marketed/non-marketed), other than biologics, with a
             potential effect on inverse psoriasis (e.g., corticosteroids, retinoids,
             dimethylfumarate, cyclosporine, azathioprine methotrexate, immunosuppressants) within
             6 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Start of treatment) (inhaled or intranasal steroids
             corresponding of up to 1 mg prednisone for asthma or rhinitis may be used)

          -  Use of very potent topical corticosteroids (WHO group IV) for the treatment of
             psoriasis on the body and/or scalp within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Start of
             treatment)

          -  Use of topical medication for the treatment of inverse psoriasis: WHO group I-III
             corticosteroids, retinoids, vitamin D analogues, immunomodulators (e.g. macrolides,
             calcineurin), anthracen derivatives, tar, or salicylic acid within 2 weeks prior to
             Visit 2 (Start of treatment)

          -  Exposure to phototherapy (PUVA, UVA, UVB, Grenz Ray therapy) within 4 weeks prior to
             Visit 2 (Start of treatment)

          -  Subjects with a positive HBV score antibody, HBsAg, anti-HCV or anti-HIV test at Visit
             1 (Screening)

          -  Subjects with history of an immunocompromising disease (e.g., lymphoma, HIV,
             Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome)

          -  Any current dermatological disorder (e.g. serborrhic dermatitis, contact dermatitis,
             cutaneous mycosis) which may confound the evaluation of inverse psoriasis

          -  Known malignancy (other than cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma) within 5 years before Visit 1 (Screening)
