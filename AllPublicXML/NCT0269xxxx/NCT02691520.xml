      The purpose of this study is to assess the epidemiology of Treatment Resistant Depression
      (TRD) in the nationally insured population in Taiwan including incidence, duration of
      clinical episodes, and prevalence by age and sex.

      This is a retrospective study of approximately one million subjects randomly selected from an
      anonymized database National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Participants aged 18
      years or older who have had neither a depression diagnosis nor a dispensing of an
      antidepressant medication in the last four months of 2004 will enter the study when they
      receive in 2005 a depression diagnosis and a dispensing of an antidepressant medication
      within 30 days of each other and will be followed up to 8 years or until they have 4 months
      with neither a depression diagnosis nor a dispensing of an antidepressant medication.
      Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) Incidence, TRD prevalence by age and sex and duration of
      clinical episodes will be estimated.
