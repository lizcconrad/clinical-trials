    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Provant Therapy System in
      improving localized nerve growth and skin perfusion in subjects with painful peripheral
      diabetic neuropathy of the foot.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is multi-site, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of the safety and
      efficacy of multi-dose Provant therapy to evaluate neuronal and vascular response in the
      treatment of subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy with an active device or an identical inactive
      sham device. Subjects will treat at home twice daily for 60 days after which they will return
      to the clinic for final evaluations. Subjects will be evaluated at the research center for a
      Baseline/Enrollment visit and again at Day 61 where assessments for safety, concomitant
      medications, Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR), Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV), Skin Perfusion
      Pressures (SPP), and Skin Biopsy will be completed. Subjects will be contacted via telephone
      at Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42 to assess adherence, safety, and concomitant medications.
      Subjects will also complete a Response to Study Device form which will capture their daily
      pain score.

          2. Subject has documented Type 2 diabetes.

          3. Subject has an HgbA1c &gt; 7% and &lt; 10%.

          4. Subject has peripheral diabetic neuropathy with pain, numbness, tingling, and/or
             burning in at least one foot confirmed by a positive provocative sign and a positive
             Tinel's sign. If both feet are involved, the one with the greatest severity will be
             selected as the index foot.

          5. Subject is in pain Phase 2, 3, or 4 (Appendix C).

          6. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent and to comply with all
             parts of the study protocol including diary entries.

          7. Female subjects must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, abstinent, or practicing
             (or agree to practice) an effective method of birth control if they are sexually
             active for the duration of the study. (Effective methods of birth control include
             prescription hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double-barrier methods,
             and/or male partner sterilization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has Type 1 diabetes.

          2. Subject is in pain Phase 1 or 5 (Appendix C).

          3. Subject has an active, open ulcer on either lower extremity of arterial, venous or
             mixed disease origin.

          4. Subject has peripheral arterial disease as determined by an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)
             of &gt;1.40 or &lt; 0.80. See Appendix E for details on obtaining the ABI.

             NOTE: If the difference in the brachial pulse pressure between the right and left arms
             is &gt; 10 mmHg, the subject will not be eligible for enrollment and will be referred to
             a cardiologist for further evaluation.

          5. Subject has venous insufficiency classified by the Venous Insufficiency Classification
             System (CEAP) of grades C3, C4, C5, or C6. See Appendix F for description of the

         15. Subject has a history of malignancy within the past five years other than successfully
             treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in the

             stimulator, bone stimulator, cochlear implant, or other implanted device with an
             implanted metal lead(s).

         19. Subject is currently pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant prior to Day 60.
