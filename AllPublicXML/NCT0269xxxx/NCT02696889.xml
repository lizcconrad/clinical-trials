      The ROSE study is designed to determine the efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cell therapy
      on ovarian function recovery in subjects with idiopathic and other types of premature ovarian
      failure (POF)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is defined as hypergonadotropic ovarian failure occurring
      prior to age 40 . It is surprisingly common and affects approximately 1% of women below the
      age of 40. The incidence is 10% to 28% in women with primary amenorrhea and 4% to 18% in
      women with secondary amenorrhea . The clinical manifestations include amenorrhea and
      abnormally high levels of luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The
      etiology of POF is unknown in most cases. It can be caused by combination of inherited
      conditions, immune disorders, environmental toxins and iatrogenic injury. The majority of
      patients with POF are considered to have idiopathic premature ovarian failure because usually
      no cause can be identified . POF has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence
      of other conditions, including Alzheimer's, cardiovascular and immune system diseases,
      metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, diabetes and cancer of reproductive organs. POF is
      characterized by loss of secondary follicles, arrested folliculogenesis, decreased estrogen
      production, and infertility . The mechanism of ovarian failure is most likely accelerated
      follicular atresia but detailed pathogenesis is yet to be fully understood .

      In women younger than 40, at least two menopausal FSH levels (≥40 IU/L) will be sufficient
      for the diagnosis of POF. It is not essential to have amenorrhea for the diagnosis of POF,
      because spontaneous menstrual cycles can sometimes be seen after the diagnosis as well.
      Resumption of normal ovarian function, albeit temporary, in patients with normal karyotypes
      has been documented in 10 to 20% of patient; thus, resumption of fertility is possible .

      No presently available therapeutic intervention has been proven effective in restoring normal
      fertility in patients with POF. Various attempts at ovarian stimulation are usually
      unsuccessful. Therefore, the diagnosis of POF can cause great physical and mental suffering
      among patients. Thus, there is critical need to develop novel effective approaches for the
      treatment of POF.

      Throughout life, there is an ongoing physiological level of atresia of oocytes. A decreased
      germ cell endowment combined with an increased rate of germ cell destruction can explain POF
      . The current concept that the ovary has a static ovarian reserve is entirely at odds with
      the germ cell dynamics. Current research supports the concept that the ovary continues to
      produce new germ cells into adult life, however if this occurs in humans is not universally
      accepted yet. Recent research suggests that diminished ovarian reserve is a result of the
      aging of the niche rather than a defect in germ cell. Emerging evidence suggests that bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could restore the structure and function of
      injured tissues. During embryologic development, cells of the mesodermal layer give rise to
      multiple mesenchymal tissue types including bone, cartilage, tendon, muscle, fat and marrow
      stroma . These precursor cells, also present in the postnatal organism, are referred to as
      mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells have been shown to retain their developmental
      potential following extensive subcultivation in vitro. Implantation of culture-expanded
      mesenchymal stem cells has been demonstrated to effect tissue regeneration in a variety of
      animal models and depends on local factors to stimulate differentiation into the appropriate
      phenotype .

      Recent studies suggest that stem cell therapy holds promise in treatment of variety of
      diseases including reproductive dysfunction. In a recent investigation by our lab, bone
      marrow stem cell (BMSC) treated animals revealed recovered ovarian function. Post bone marrow
      nucleated cell transplantation, treated animals revealed resumption of estrogen production
      and folliculogenesis . In another investigation by Lui et al (2014), granulosa cell apoptosis
      induced by cisplatin was reduced when BMSCs were migrated to granulosa cells in vitro. In
      this study, chemotherapy-induced POF rats were injected with BMSCs. The BMSCs treatment
      group's antral follicle count and estradiol levels increased after 30 days, compared with
      untreated POF group . In a recent clinical trial in Egypt, Edessy et al evaluated the
      therapeutic potential of autologous mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells transplantation in
      women with POF. Ten patients with POF were selected and their ovaries were injected with
      autologous BMSC via laparoscopy. The results revealed resumption of menstruation in one case
      after 3 months; two cases showed focal secretory changes after having atrophic endometrium .
      According to these results, BMSC seem to have the ability to revive prematurely failed
      ovaries both in its hormonal and follicular development abilities.

    <description>Patients with POF choosing to enroll will be provided informed consent for Rejuvenation of Premature Ovarian Failure With Stem Cells (ROSE). They will undergo diagnosis and screening confirming POF including History and Physical Exams, Labs and Diagnostic Procedures. Following final approval and under anesthesia, bone marrow aspiration with separation of the bone marrow derived stem cell fraction will be performed. Diagnostic laparoscopy will allow for assessment of pelvic anatomy; biopsy of the right ovary and subsequent injection of the bone marrow derived stem cells into the right ovary.</description>
