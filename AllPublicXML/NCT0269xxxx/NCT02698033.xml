      This protocol is designed to better characterize a sub-population of peanut sensitized
      individuals who may be non-allergic, despite significant sensitization, or who may be
      allergic, but at high threshold doses. By specifically targeting participants who met the
      initial screening criteria of the active adult PN OIT study, Protocol 2012p002153 / AADCRC
      MGH-004 (MGH-004), but failed to react during the pre-treatment 443 mg challenge to peanut,
      the investigators anticipate that the investigators will identify individuals who have become
      spontaneously tolerant, despite persistent sensitization. The investigators might also find
      that clinical sensitivity persists but only with higher thresholds, or that sensitivity has
      increased (or is variable) since the previous allergen exposure. By repeating DBPCFCs through
      to a full serving dose (7.4 gram), the investigators will distinguish participants who react
      only at higher doses from those who were not truly peanut allergic, address whether their
      sensitivity has changed, and have the opportunity to further investigate their immune
      response to peanut allergen.

      The primary objective of the study is to identify and characterize a sub-population of peanut
      sensitized individuals who are not allergic to peanut and characterize their immunological
      phenotype in comparison with the low-threshold peanut allergic individuals enrolled in the
      adult PN OIT study (2012P002153/AADCRC MGH-004).

      The investigators also wish to identify and characterize the sub-population of high-threshold
      peanut-allergic individuals who have clinical reactivity to peanut allergen but only at
      higher doses and characterize their immunological phenotype in comparison with the
      low-threshold peanut allergic individuals enrolled in the adult PN OIT study
      (2012P002153/AADCRC MGH-004). Some of the The investigators will identify these
      high-threshold peanut allergic and sensitized, but non-allergic individuals by recruiting
      subjects who enrolled in 2012POO2153 but failed to meet all of the inclusion criteria -
      specifically, they failed to have objective symptoms during a food challenge with a
      cumulative total dose of 443 mg. The investigators will then clarify their status by
      conducting a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to peanut, using higher doses of
      peanut. The investigators will draw blood before and after this food challenge, and collect
      urine and stool at the time of the challenge for studies of immune mechanisms.

      The specific clinical, mechanistic, and exploratory objectives are as follows:

      Clinical Objective:

      To evaluate the clinical status of peanut-sensitized individuals previously passing a DBPCFC
      to 443 mg as being either: non-allergic, stably high-threshold allergic or more clinically
      reactive on repeat exposure.

      Mechanistic Objectives:

      To determine whether clinical sensitivity to peanut allergen (as defined by the eliciting
      dose during food challenge) is directly associated with the relative frequency within a
      peanut-specific regulatory CD4+ CD45RA- T cell subset (based on expression of CTLA-4, FOXP3,
      SGMS-1, FANK-1 and other validated iTreg signature genes) before the DBPCFC or 6-8 weeks
      after the DBPCFC.

      To determine whether clinical sensitivity to peanut allergen (as defined by the eliciting
      dose during food challenge) is inversely associated with the the relative frequency within a
      peanut-specific Th2 effector CD4+ CD45RA- T cell subset (based on expression of GATA-3,
      RASGRP1, IL4R and other validated Th2 signature genes) before the DBPCFC or 6-8 weeks after
      the DBPCFC.

      To determine whether there has been a detectable expansion and/or diversification of
      Arah2-specific B cells since the previous (PNOIT2 screen fail) peanut allergen exposure and
      again 6-8 weeks after the DBPCFC by affinity selection of circulating cells and NGS of BCRs
      and how any such change correlates with clinical tolerance on DBPCFC.

      To determine whether the extent of either mast cell or basophil reactivity is significantly
      greater among high-threshold peanut allergic participants that the investigators anticipate
      identifying in this protocol versus the low-threshold peanut allergic participants already
      identified.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      To describe the gene expression profiles and clonal diversity of regulatory and effector T
      cell subsets among high-threshold peanut allergic participants versus the low-threshold
      peanut allergic patients to better understand the phenotype and ontogeny of these subsets and
      potentially discover new therapeutic pathways.

      To determine if increases in mast cell activation can be detected through measurement of
      serum and urinary LTE4 over the course of a large dose exposure to peanut allergen during
      DBPCFC, and if decreases in LTE4 can be measured as a marker of tolerance.

      To determine whether microbial dysbiosis is associated with the development of
      desensitization, oral tolerance, or persistent gastrointestinal adverse events while on oral
      immunotherapy.
