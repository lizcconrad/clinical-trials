  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is a manual method of treatment, addressed to mechanical pain of the
      neuromusculoskeletal system. In the clinical practice a favorable effect is observed in
      patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, but there is no published studies evaluating the
      results os this technique.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is more effective in
      symptoms, function, grip, mechanosensitivity and neural conduction velocity compared to a
      placebo.

      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial double-blind
      (patient and examiner). The investigators included patients diagnosed of carpal tunnel
      syndrome (low to moderate intensity) with a neurophysiological test.

      Patients included are randomized into 2 groups one receive Diacutaneous Fibrolysis and the
      other placebo. Both groups receive 5 treatment sessions.

      The variables are measured at the beginning and end of treatment. And also some variables are
      measured before and after each session. Patients who participated in placebo group, when the
      intervention finish the investigators will be given the opportunity to receive the actual
      technique

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators selected patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome with
      electroneurogram, if they meet the inclusion criteria are offered to take part in this study.

      When the patient agree to participate and signed informed consent, the investigators
      collected dependent variables considered (symptoms, mechanosensitivity, functional capacity
      with upper limb, tractor speed of neural conduction ...) and the patient is assigned to an
      intervention group: real or placebo. Each patient receives treatment 5 sessions trascurriendo
      intersessional 2- 5 days. After 5 sessions the investigators remeasured the same variables.
      In addition, a month later they remeasured again symptoms and functional capacity with upper
      limb. Finally, they were shown the technique they have received. If the patient has received
      the technical placebo he/she is given the opportunity to receive 5 sessions of the actual
      technique.
