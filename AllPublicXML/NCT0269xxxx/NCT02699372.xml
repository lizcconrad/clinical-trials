  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single center, adaptive single ascending dose (Part 1) and multiple
      ascending dose (Part 2) study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics following an oral administration of RO6889450 versus
      placebo in healthy volunteers. The anticipated duration of this study is approximately 18
      weeks.
