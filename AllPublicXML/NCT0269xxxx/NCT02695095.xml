  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare, by insulin use at the index date, the incidence of hospitalization for acute
      liver injury (ALI) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are new users of
      dapagliflozin with those who are new users of antidiabetic drugs (ADs) in classes other than
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, insulin monotherapy, metformin
      monotherapy, or sulfonylurea monotherapy

      The overall goal of this research study is to estimate the risk of hospitalization for acute
      liver injury in patients who are prescribed dapagliflozin compared to patients prescribed
      other specific oral antidiabetic drugs. Dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic drugs are used
      to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin and
      results from small safety monitoring studies, there is interest in further evaluating the
      safety of dapagliflozin in large populations.

      The study will be implemented in three administrative health care data sources in two
      countries: in the United Kingdom, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); and in the
      United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare databases and
      the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM). Individuals in the databases will be
      included in the study if they meet the following age criteria; 18 years and older (CPRD and
      HIRD), or 65 years or older (Medicare); and if they did not have type 1 diabetes, are new
      users of one of the study drugs and meet the criteria of at least 180 days of electronic data
      before their first prescription of the study drug. The study period starts July 1, 2013 in
      CPRD, January 1, 2014 in PHARMO and January 9, 2014 in the United States data sources, and
      will end at the latest available data at each database at the time of analysis.
