  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pressure ulcer in hospitals is 7,3% - 23%. The primary etiological factors
      are pressure or pressure combined with shear. Prevention is very important and comprises:
      preventive skin care including cleansing and protecting the skin from exposure to moisture,
      the systematic repositioning of the patient, the offloading of the heels from the surface of
      the bed, the use of adequate bed support surfaces and an adequate nutritional status. The
      development and implementation of a risk based prevention plan for individuals identified as
      being at risk is strongly recommended. Limited compliance exists towards pressure ulcer
      preventive interventions. 25,5% of the patients at risk receive fully adequate prevention in
      bed. The reposition frequence is adequate in 55% of patients at risk. There is a lack of
      rigorously performed research addressing the effectiveness of devices or risk based protocols
      to improve compliance. Health care budgets are limited, priorities should be set in the
      allocation of health care resources.

      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the turn and position system
      (Prevalon®Turn and Position System 2.0, SAGE) versus standard care to improve reposition
      frequence in patients at risk. The second aim is to compare the effectiveness of a tailored
      protocol versus standard care to improve reposition frequence in patients at risk. The third
      aim is to compare the effectiveness of standardized incontinence care versus standard care to
      improve the incidence of pressure ulcers and incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Also a
      health economic evaluation will be performed.

      The study will be performed in hospital setting (university and general hospitals) in a
      random sample of 226 patients aged &gt; 18 who are at risk of developing pressure ulcers.
      Patients will be recruited from three types of wards: intensive care units, geriatric wards
      and rehabilitation wards. Patients will be included in the study for a period of 8 days.
