    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated
      mumps vaccine in healthy infants between 8 - 18 months old with a commercialized live
      attenuated mumps vaccine as the control vaccine.

      This study is a randomized, blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated mumps
      vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd. The control vaccine is
      a commercialized live attenuated mumps vaccine manufactured by Zhejiang VACN
      bio-pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. All participants are healthy infants between 8 - 18 months old,
      and will be randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the ratio 1:1.
