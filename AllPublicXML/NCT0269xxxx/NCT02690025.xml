        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Following receipt of verbal and written information about the trial, the patient must
             provide signed informed consent before any trial related activity is carried out.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 90 years

          -  Stable SBS patients with intestinal insufficiency or failure, where the last surgical
             resection of gut tissue was performed at least 1 year ago

          -  A stable PS volume ( &lt; 25% change in volume or energy content) for four weeks prior to
             randomization for patients requiring PS

          -  Wet weight of fecal excretion ≥ 1500 g/day demonstrated during a hospital stay prior
             to screening or during at least one day of the first baseline balance study.

          -  Stable body weight (&lt;5% weight deviance in the three months prior to screening)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known or suspected intestinal strictures of clinical relevance as judged
             by the Investigator

          -  Active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or fistula during the screening period as
             judged by conventional means of the Investigator.

          -  Crohn's disease patients not being in clinical remission for the last 12 weeks prior
             to randomization

          -  Cardiac disease defined as: Decompensated heart failure (NYHA class III-IV) and/or
             diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction within the last 6
             months prior to screening

          -  History of cancer (except resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma and
             except in situ cervical cancer) unless it can be documented that the patient has been
             in a disease-free state for at least 5 years (except colon cancer: patients with a
             history of colon cancer generally have to be excluded)

          -  eGFR (by the MDRD formula) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  Clinically meaningful renal disease as judged by the Investigator
