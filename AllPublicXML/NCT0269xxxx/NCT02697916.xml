  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADAPTABLE is a pragmatic clinical trial in which 20,000 patients who are at high risk for
      ischemic events will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an aspirin dose of 81
      mg/day vs. 325 mg/day. Study participants will be enrolled over 24 months. Maximum follow-up
      will be 30 months. The purpose of the study is to identify the optimal dose of aspirin for
      secondary prevention in patients with Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The
      primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, hospitalization for MI, or
      hospitalization for stroke. The primary safety endpoint is hospitalization for major bleeding
      with an associated blood product transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pragmatic, patient-centered clinical trial, the investigators will compare the
      effectiveness of two doses of aspirin (81 mg and 325 mg) currently in widespread use in the
      United States in the secondary-prevention population of patients with established ASCVD. The
      trial will use a novel format that uses existing electronic health records (EHRs), as well as
      a web-based patient portal to collect patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and available patient
      encounter data to supplement/support the EHR. Patients who are identified as candidates for
      the trial will be directed to the electronic patient portal for the eConsent as well as an
      abbreviated eligibility confirmation and randomization. One of the important aims of
      ADAPTABLE is to engage patients, their healthcare providers, and trial investigators in using
      the infrastructure PCORnet has developed and continues to refine. A total of 20,000 high-risk
      patients with ASCVD will be randomly assigned (in an open-label fashion) in a 1:1 ratio to
      instructions to use a daily aspirin dose of either 81 mg or 325 mg daily. The investigators
      expect the entire sample of patients will be enrolled over 24 months, with a maximum
      follow-up of 30 months.
