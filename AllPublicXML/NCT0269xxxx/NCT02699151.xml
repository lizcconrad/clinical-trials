  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are related entities. Only
      in the last years a series of observational studies mainly conducted in France could show
      that ´isolated SVT´ (without concomitant deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is
      in fact not a benign and spontaneously healing disease but bears a potential for severe
      thromboembolic complications once not treated adequately. INSIGHTS-SVT study aims at
      collecting representative data on the current management and outcomes of SVT in Germany under
      real-life conditions. It will document the implementation of the recently issued national SVT
      guidelines issued by the Society for Angiology (DGA) and the Society for Phlebology (DGP).

    <description>VTE: composite of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic recurrent superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), or symptomatic progression (extension) of SVT.
This endpoint comprises symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE as reported by the treating physicians (usually diagnosed with compression ultrasonography or other appropriate methods).
Events will be adjudicated.</description>

    <description>Definition of bleeding events is based on American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (major bleedings) and the &quot;Comparison of Arixtra in lower limb superficial vein thrombosis with placebo&quot; (CALISTO) study definition (other bleedings), respectively.
Events will be adjudicated.</description>

Symptomatic progression of initially diagnosed SVT: extension by at least 2 cm, confirmed compression ultrasonography or duplex ultrasonography, and &gt; 3 cm away from the saphenofemoral crossing.
