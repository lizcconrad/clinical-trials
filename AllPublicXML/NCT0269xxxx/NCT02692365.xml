  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, national, single-center, open-label study, being conducted at the
      Institute of Education and Research of the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in collaboration with the
      Radiology Institute, the Heart Institute of the Faculty of Medicine of São Paulo, Hospital
      São Paulo UNIFESP, and the Departments of Physics and Mathematics at the University of São
      Paulo in order to detect the presence of calcium flux change, tumor perfusion and electrical
      properties of tumor tissue when exposed to RF EMF AM by Cancer-frequency specific in patients
      with advanced HCC and correlate these findings with hemodynamic changes assessed by
      non-invasive hemodynamic measurements.

      This study aims to demonstrate the presence of three mechanisms (hypothesis) that could be
      involved in the hemodynamic changes and the specific antitumor effect induced by exposure to
      RF EMF AM cancer-specific frequency. This study is not intended to study a therapeutic or
      diagnostic procedure. For this reason, will not be considered evolutionary clinical data
      during and after the intervention of the study.
