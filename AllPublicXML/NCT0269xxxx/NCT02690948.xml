  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1/2 trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib works in
      treating patients with skin basal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, are checkpoint
      inhibitors that stimulate immune response. Vismodegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking signals needed for cell growth.

      This study is a non-randomized evaluation of pembrolizumab as a treatment for unresectable or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Participants are assigned to treatment with
      pembrolizumab plus vismodegib or pembrolizumab monotherapy on the basis of suitability for
      treatment with smoothened (SMO) inhibitors such as vismodegib. Prospective participants who
      have progressed on vismodegib, are intolerant to or have a medical contra-indication to
      vismodegib may receive pembrolizumab monotherapy. Because treatment is non-randomized, no
      comparison between treatment groups is conducted.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic BCC
      patients to pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib (all evaluable patients) at 18 weeks

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the ORRs of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab
           monotherapy at 18 weeks

        -  To assess the ORRs of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab
           monotherapy at 9 weeks

        -  To assess ORRs of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab plus
           vismodegib at 18 weeks

        -  To assess ORRs of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab plus
           vismodegib at 9 weeks

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (either monotherapy or
           combination therapy) for unresectable or metastatic BCC.

        -  To assess the duration of response after pembrolizumab (either monotherapy or
           combination therapy)

        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events

        -  Correlative studies including Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
           pre-treatment, lymphocytic infiltrates pre- and post-treatment, mutational analysis pre-
           and post-treatment

    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response rate (ORR) of participants with unresectable or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) after treatment with A) pembrolizumab monotherapy and B) pembrolizumab in combination with vismodegib, will be assessed as the percentage of patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, after 9 and 18 weeks of treatment. ORR is calculated as the ratio of patients with CR or PR as a percentage of the patients evaluable for OR.
RECIST criteria:
Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR) = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria</description>
