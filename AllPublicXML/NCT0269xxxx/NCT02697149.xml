  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation exposure may put endoscopists at risk when performing endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography. Although non-radiation endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography was reported in pregnant women in previous reports, it remains
      unclear whether endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is also effective and safe
      when endoscopists were not expose to radiation. This study was to evaluate the effectiveness
      and safety of nonradiation-to-endoscopist endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in
      patients with complexity level I/II.

    <description>All patients received magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography before the procedure. Characteristics of lesions (e.g. common bile duct stones, stenosis) in detail was identified. During the procedure, the endoscopist was not exposed to radiation. If fluoroscopy was needed, after contrast injection (sometimes not necessary), the endoscopist went outside of the operation room and observed the X-ray image by remote control of the fluoroscopy machine.</description>
