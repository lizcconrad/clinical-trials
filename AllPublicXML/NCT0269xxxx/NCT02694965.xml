      Purpose of the study:

      The investigators are proposing that melanomas which respond and develop eventual disease
      stability in response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy undergo a genetic program
      promoting secondary resistance.

      Understanding these genetic alterations and the factors which contribute to this process
      would be critical for the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets which may
      synergize with the T cell-targeted checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this work promises to
      provide greater insight into tumor-mediated immune evasion mechanisms and primary
      immunotherapy resistance, potentially unveiling predictive markers of clinical response for
      our expanding arsenal of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

      Many patients who exhibit a response to the anti-PD-1 antibodies develop a prolonged course
      of disease stability which resembles the equilibrium phase of the previously proposed process
      of cancer immunoediting. This state of equipoise has been hypothesized to involve genetic
      alterations that promote immune evasion and, in some cases, lead to the development of tumor
      escape. Based on our data, the investigators propose that melanomas that develop a period of
      disease stability in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy exhibit genetic alterations that
      suppress the effectiveness of anti-tumor immunity. Our previous studies indicate that the
      tumor-derived factors that play a role in the paracrine signaling pathways capable of
      regulating nearby stromal cell populations are more likely to be critical immune regulators
      of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the investigators will focus our studies on those
      differentially expressed genes which encode soluble proteins using an available prediction
      algorithm. Those genes identified by this study to be differentially expressed in the
      melanoma tissues of patients demonstrating a clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy will be further evaluated in transgenic autochthonous melanoma models.

        Eligible patients with stage IV or unresectable stage IIIC melanoma selected to undergo
        either anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab), anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or
        combined anti-CTLA-4 antibody/anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy will be asked to participate
        in the study by the Principal Investigator, co-Investigators, or clinical staff.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma, with melanoma validated by
             histology or cytology

          -  Patients may participate with primary cutaneous melanomas of unknown primary site

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          -  Patient will be treated with either an anti-CTLA-4 antibody , an anti-PD-1 antibody,
             an anti-PD-L1 antibody, or a combination of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody/anti-PD-1 antibody
             (combined therapy regimens with any other agents are not allowed on this study)

          -  Patient must have a measurable systemic lesion defined as greater than or equal to 10
             mm based on PET CT/CT/MRI imaging. Pretreatment PET CT/CT imaging must be performed ≤
             42 days prior to treatment initiation.

          -  Patients with target skin lesions must equal at least 10 mm when their longest
             diameters are aggregated. Target skin lesions (5 maximum) must be at least 5 mm in
             their longest diameter to be considered measurable by caliper or ruler.

          -  Those patients with a failed biopsy attempt or those with disease that is not amenable
             to biopsy will still be eligible for enrollment and will only undergo blood draws
             during the study protocol.
