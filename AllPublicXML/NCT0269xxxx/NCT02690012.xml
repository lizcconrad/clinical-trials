  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypomagnesemia (hMg) is a common side effect of important anti-cancer therapies such as
      epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) and platinum-containing anti-cancer
      drugs. EGFRIs, including cetuximab (cmab) and panitumumab (pmab), have been estimated to
      cause hMg in over 18% and 27% of patients respectively1, while 90% of patients receiving
      cisplatin will develop hMg if left untreated. The development of severe hMg may result in
      increased symptoms such as fatigue, neuromuscular changes, mental status changes and cardiac
      arrhythmias which could result in treatment delays and may compromise treatment efficacy.
      Despite the common occurrence of this toxicity, little is known regarding the optimal
      magnesium management strategy. As physicians do not know what the &quot;best&quot; treatment for
      patients is, genuine uncertainty (&quot;clinical equipoise&quot;) exists. Physicians will choose
      between different &quot;standards&quot; of magnesium replacement in their personal practice, using
      idiosyncratic decision making processes, without the physician or the patient knowing the
      optimal option. This is not good for patients, physicians and society as a whole. Determining
      the optimal treatment remains an important medical issue for patients, physicians and
      society. This study will use a novel method to allow comparisons of established standard of
      care prophylactic treatment using the &quot;integrated consent model&quot; as part of a pragmatic
      clinical trial7. By integrating medical and clinical practices, physicians will be able to
      inform their patients about the randomized control trial, akin to a typical conversation
      between the physician and patient, without written informed consent. This clinical
      interaction would then be documented, as ordinarily done in practice. Medical and clinical
      practice will be intertwined with the patients' welfare at the forefront of our best
      interests.
