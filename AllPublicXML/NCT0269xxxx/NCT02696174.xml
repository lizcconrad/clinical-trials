  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the Phase 3 of a 3 phase study to determine the feasibility, acceptability and
      effectiveness of a health microinsurance scheme in improving health equity and clinical
      outcomes for private primary care (PPC) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This two-arm, pre-post,
      quasi-experimental trial consisted of utilizing a HMI scheme (experimental clinic) and normal
      OOP payments (control clinic) for 6 months. The HMI scheme enabled subscribed households to
      access a defined benefit package at a selected PPC for treatment and follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a quasi-experimental study designed to determine the effectiveness of a
      community health microinsurance scheme (HMI) in private primary care clinics in Malaysia via
      a pre-post study of an experimental and control clinic. A proposed HMI scheme, whose price
      and benefit package have been defined through the earlier Phases 1 and 2, will be accessible
      to subscribed households at the experimental clinic, while the control clinic has subscribed
      patients paying as per normal practise, which is by Out-Of-Pocket payment. The HMI scheme
      enabled subscribers to visit the selected clinic chosen for any form of primary care
      diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Both the clinics are located in the Jalan Ipoh area, a
      suburb of Kuala Lumpur, and have common sociodemographic characteristics. A pre-intervention
      questionnaire will aim to capture health seeking behaviour, delay in seeking medical care,
      monthly health expenditure and improvements in clinical outcome (assessed by clinical test
      results). After six months, a post-intervention questionnaire is administered again to the
      respondents which then allows assessment of the outcome variables.
