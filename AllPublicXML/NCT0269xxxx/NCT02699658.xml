    <textblock>
      Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is the optical S-(-) isomer of ofloxacin with a
      broad spectrum of activity. In common with other fluoroquinolones, the main
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that correlates with its therapeutic efficacy
      is the area under the plasma time-concentration curve/the minimum inhibitory concentration
      ratios.

      The aims of the study were to:

        1. reveal the population pharmacokinetics, and

        2. assess the efficacy of various dosage regimens in achieving the probability of target
           attainment (PTA) and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) of levofloxacin when oral
           levofloxacin was prescribed as the switching therapy after intravenous levofloxacin
           treatment.

      The study was conducted in 45 healthy volunteers. Each subject received one 500 mg tablet of
      levofloxacin, after which PK studies were carried out, using a Monte Carlo simulation to
      determine the PTA. By referral to the EUCAST MIC distributions database, the dosage regimens
      were predicted to achieve CFR greater than or equal to 90%.
