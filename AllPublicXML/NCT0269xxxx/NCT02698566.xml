    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study designed to evaluate usability of ranibizumab PFS in patients
      with neovascular age related macular degeneration or macular edema secondary to retinal vein
      occlusion.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of HCPs to follow the instructions for use
      (IFU) to prepare and administer a ranibizumab PFS ITV injection dose to patients.

    <description>Product use tasks included sequence of steps starting from opening the carton, removing contents from carton to disposing of used PFS and needle. Tasks were considered to be successfully completed if the correct results were achieved without a use error, even if the instructions for use (IFU) were not followed exactly (example: not removing the needle cap prior to adjusting a dose). Usage error was defined as user action or lack of user action while using the medical device that led to a different result than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user. The ability of HCPs to follow the IFU to prepare and administer a ranibizumab PFS ITV injection dose to patients was evaluated by successful task completion.</description>

        Concurrent Ocular Conditions

          -  Patients legally blind in one or both eyes

          -  History of or any current clinically relevant intraocular inflammation or ocular
             inflammatory reaction (any grading from trace and greater is excluded), including
             non-infectious uveitis or uveitis, or sterile inflammatory reaction after the past ITV
             injections with any agent

          -  Active disorder of ocular adnexa and skin in the study eye, including ocular surface

             including any prior excessive intraocular (including subconjunctival) bleeding or

          -  Uncontrolled intraocular pressure greater than (&gt;) 25 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) in
             the study eye (uncontrolled means that it occurs even with intraocular
             pressure-lowering therapy)

          -  Use of therapies that are known to be toxic to any ocular tissues within the 6 months
             prior to enrollment

        Prior Ocular Therapies

          -  Treatment with any ITV injection within the 27 days prior to Day 1

             retina specialist represent a contraindication to ranibizumab use in the patient or
             may represent an unwarranted patient risk.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg while
             sitting)

          -  Current systemic infectious disease or a therapy for active infectious disease
