    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apremilast in
      subjects with moderate Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label 28-week trial. All Subjects will receive Apremilast with the
      initial titrating dose as per package insert (10mg per day on day #1, escalating to 30mg
      twice daily at day #6 and continuation at this dose).

      The primary efficacy endpoint is:

      The Proportion of subjects achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at
      week 16, defined as a 30% reduction in the total number of abscess and inflammatory nodule
      count with a 50% reduction as an exploratory endpoint..

      The Secondary endpoints are:

        1. The number of patients achieving a one point reduction in the Physician's Global
           Assessment (PGA) score at week 16

        2. Changes in Modified Sartorius scale from Baseline to Week 16

        3. The number of patients achieving a two point reduction (required from baseline score) in
           the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score at week 16

        4. Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI,

      The study will be conducted over 24 weeks on active therapy followed by a four week
      observational visit. The total length of the study will be 28 weeks.

      Study visits will occur at Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and then a
      observational follow up 4 weeks afterwards. Additionally, all subjects will be contacted by
      phone 1 week following the Baseline visit to ensure daily pain assessments are being
      recorded. If any signs or symptoms are reported at the time of the call, an unscheduled study
      visit will be conducted to assess whether an infection is present.

      Adverse events will be collected throughout the study.
