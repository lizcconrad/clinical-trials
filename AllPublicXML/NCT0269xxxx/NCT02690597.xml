    <textblock>
      Screening of anxiogenic part of pain is an imperative during a medical pain consultation. The
      actual tools for evaluation of this specific part are complex and time consuming.

      To date, it lacked a reliable and reproductive tool to quickly evaluate anxiety of patient in
      pain. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the pertinence and validity of anxiety
      analogic visual scale by comparison with the actual reference the self-assessment
      questionnaire State Trait Inventory Anxiety Y-A form.
