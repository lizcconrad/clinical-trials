  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bupropion is used in psychological disorder mainly in major depressive disorder (MDD). In
      China, buproprion Immediate Release (IR) and Sustained Release (SR) tablet have been in
      market for the treatment of MDD. Bupropion Hydrochloride (HCl) Extended Release (XL) tablets
      formulation is proposed for marketing approval in China for same indication. Therefore, a
      pharmacokinetic study is planned to be conducted in Chinese subjects. It is an open label,
      single-centre and single cycle study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of 150 milligram (mg) and 300 mg following single and repeated daily doses.
      Approximately 16 males and females Chinese healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study
      to get 12 completed subjects.
