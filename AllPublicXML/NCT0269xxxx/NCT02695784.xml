  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of the preterm gut microbiota in health and disease has been well established.
      However, relatively little is known about how the microbiome changes after discharge and its
      relationship with growth, health and disease outcomes in the preterm population. This study
      aims to follow a cohort of preterm infants and explore the relationship of the later
      microbiome ('after discharge') with later growth and health outcomes in infancy. The study
      will also explore the effect of timing of stopping routinely administered probiotics on the
      post-discharge microbiome, infant feeding and outcomes such as colic.

      The investigators aim to longitudinally follow 40 infants born before 32 weeks gestation who
      have also taken part in the investigators microbiome study during their NICU stay (SERVIS REC
      No: 10/H0908/39) and where microbiomic sampling has been adequately achieved. The
      investigators will collect stool at and beyond the time of anticipated discharge (beyond 34
      weeks) targeted to include pre- and post-weaning, and again at a year. Actual discharge
      timing of these infants varies, and is usually latest in the most immature infants, allowing
      an assessment of the influence of physical location (NICU vs home) as well as increasing age.
      Using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon analysis, the investigators will assess bacterial
      colonisation of the gut and measure infant weight, length and head circumference at each time
      point. The investigators will use a parent questionnaire to assess daily crying time,
      parents' perceptions of colic severity using a visual analogue scale as well as vomiting and
      constipation for the two weeks before sampling.
