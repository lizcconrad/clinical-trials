    <measure>Barratt Impulsivity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 0.5, 1,2,3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) is a widely used measure of impulsiveness. It includes 30 items that are scored to yield six first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and three second-order factors (attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness).The BIS-11 is a 30-item self-report questionnaire, that is scored to yield a total score, three second-order factors, and six first-order factors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Panic disorder severity scale(PDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 0.5, 1,2,3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The items assess panic frequency, distress during panic, panic-focused anticipatory anxiety, phobic avoidance of situations, phobic avoidance of physical sensations, impairment in work functioning, and impairment in social functioning. The overall assessment is made by a total score, which is calculated by summing the scores for all seven items. The total scores range from 0 to 28.</description>
