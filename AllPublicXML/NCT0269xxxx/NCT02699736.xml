      The EuroSIDA study is a prospective observational cohort study of 20,000+ patients followed
      in 100+ clinics in 35 European countries, Israel and Argentina. The study is the largest
      pan-European cohort study and few studies of a comparable design are available on a global
      scale. The EuroSIDA study is an ongoing collaboration and patients have been enrolled into
      the study through 10 cohorts since 1994.

      The main objective of the study remains the same as in1994: to prospectively study, clinical,
      therapeutic, demographic, virological and laboratory data from HIV-1 positive persons across
      Europe in order to determine their long-term virological, immunological and clinical
      outcomes.

      Historically, EuroSIDA has been crucial in reporting key changes in the HIV epidemic, such as
      the dramatic changes in morbidity and mortality when combination anti-retroviral therapy
      (cART) was first introduced. As new anti-HCV treatment is introduced to HIV/HCV co-infected
      patients, it is important for EuroSIDA to remain in the forefront of investigating the
      treatment benefits and adverse effects.

      All study documents, study status, newsletters, scientific publications and presentations are
      available online and are updated continuously at project website.

      In general terms, the objective of the EuroSIDA study is to continue a long-term, prospective
      collection of clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data as well as plasma on a large cohort
      of consecutive HIV infected patients from across Europe in order to (1) assess the factors
      associated with the clinical, immunological and virological course of HIV infection and
      HIV-related co-infections and co-morbidities, and (2) continue to provide and develop a
      surveillance system to describe temporal changes and regional differences in the clinical
      course of HIV and HIV-related co-infections and co-morbidities in Europe.

      Abstract: There are currently over 1½ million people across Europe infected with HIV. The
      epidemic continues to intensify in the Eastern European region where prevalence of HIV will
      continue to increase in the years to come. There are significant problems with the management
      of this public health crisis. Available antiretroviral therapy (ART) - although extremely
      effective - does not eradicate HIV and hence has to be continued for life. Other limitations
      are the development of resistance, adverse effects of treatment, and the requirement for
      strict adherence. Despite these limitations, the widespread use of potent ART has resulted in
      a dramatic decrease in HIV-related mortality across Europe. As the incidence of AIDS has
      declined, the relative importance of co-morbidities and co-infections, such as chronic viral
      hepatitis and tuberculosis (TB), has increased. Around a third of all EuroSIDA patients are
      co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and liver-related death is now the second most
      common cause of death after AIDS. With the introduction of new more potent and better
      tolerated oral direct acting antivirals (DAAs) against HCV, major changes in the management
      and outcome HCV co-infection is anticipated in the coming years. However due to the high cost
      of DAAs, access to new treatment could vary substantially across Europe.

      Over 20,000 consecutively enrolled HIV-1 positive patients from over 100 clinical centres in
      35 European countries, Israel and Argentina - one quarter from the eastern region - are
      currently enrolled in EuroSIDA. New cohorts of patients are normally enrolled every 2-3 years
      to ensure all regions of Europe where the epidemic is prevalent are represented so the study
      will give timely information on the clinical presentation and outcome of European HIV-1
      positive patients. In 2012, 2500 additional patients were enrolled into EuroSIDA cohort IX.
      To be at the forefront of investigating the benefits and adverse effects of new HCV treatment
      in co-infected patients, the next EuroSIDA cohort (cohort X) to be enrolled in 2014, will
      exclusively consist of 5000 HIV-1 patients positive for antibodies against HCV.

      The EuroSIDA study group has now been working on the EuroSIDA study since 1994 and has
      several notable accomplishments to date, including publication of more than 200 papers in
      peer-reviewed journals (including the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet among
      others). The focus of EuroSIDA has naturally changed over this period, which demonstrates an
      eagerness to be flexible, dynamic, and focus on contemporary issues, and the study group is
      committed to continue working with such principles.

      In recent years, EuroSIDA has, in addition to the scientific publications, prioritized
      capacity building in Eastern Europe with HIV seminars, hosting clinicians from Eastern Europe
      as European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) students in the office of Copenhagen HIV Programme
      and sponsoring 2-3 young physicians from Eastern Europe to participate in a statistical
      course in London every year.

      Most of the data are collected from the clinics as part of routine care. Additionally, the
      central plasma repository will be used to extend earlier studies of the viral epidemiology of
      HIV (resistance and subtypes).

      Primary study objective: To prospectively study, clinical, therapeutic, demographic,
      virological and laboratory data from HIV-1 positive persons across Europe in order to
      determine the long-term virological, immunological and clinical outcome. The specific
      objectives, falling into four main categories, are as follows:

        1. To examine the efficacy of ART and factors that limits this

        2. To detect current or emerging late onset adverse events among patients on ART

        3. To continue surveillance of HIV in clinics around Europe to describe temporal changes
           and regional difference

        4. To monitor the uptake and outcome of HCV therapy and development of direct acting
           antivirals and compare differences between EuroSIDA regions

      Study visits: Enrolment + follow-up Data collection: For all HIV-1 positive patients enrolled
      and under follow up, laboratory, therapeutic and clinical data on HIV, viral hepatitis and
      serious non-AIDS clinical events are collected, as well as demographic data and possible data
      on pregnancy and the HIV status of the newborn baby. The patients are seen within their
      clinics as required and according to their local physician. EuroSIDA does not involve patient
      interviews or study visits, the information is collected from patient notes twice a year.

    <description>EuroSIDA is a non-interventional epidemiological cohort study that collects structured data. Data is not collected real time, but in 6-monthly intervals. The clinical data is centered on collecting laboratory variables and ascertaining predefined meaningful clinical events as well as reasons for changing and or stopping treatment regimens. The observational cohort study concept means that EuroSIDA does not collect Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, Serious Adverse Reactions or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions as defined by pharmacovigilance requirements for marketing authorization holders. However, EuroSIDA often analyses and reports specific clinical events of interest, occasionally related to drug classes, but more regularly with a focus on regional differences in treatment and care.</description>

        The EuroSIDA study recruits HIV-1 positive patients above the age of 16 years in the
        proportions in which they are represented in the participating clinics, which ensures that
        women are proportionally represented in the study. Approximately 26% of the patients are
        women. The study does not intervene with the clinical management of the patients followed,
        but only collects information based on provider-patient interviews, from patient records
        and from plasma samples collected. Pregnant women may participate in the study, as no
        interference with their treatment or pregnancy in any way will take place. Data on
        frequency and outcome of pregnancy are collected in the study once a year.
