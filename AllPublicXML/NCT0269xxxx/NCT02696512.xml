      This is a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IBRF ACP/MCP intervention protocol
      in patients with severe disorders of consciousness (SDOC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no empirically validated, evidence-based pharmacological interventions
      for the treatment of Severe Disorders of Consciousness (SDOC). In addition, it is unclear why
      poly-pharmacological interventions, while more common in the treatment of other disorders
      (e.g., cancer, chronic pain), have not been embraced for the treatment SDOC; some of the lone
      agents used in treatment of SDOC patients are not &quot;indicated&quot; for combined treatment.

      In addition, the treatment of SDOC traditionally employs the use of single or small
      combinations of pharmacological agents, with no single pharmacological agent being identified
      as efficacious or effective. As such, a poly-pharmacological intervention may, inherently,
      involve pharmacological interactions that were not anticipated by the drug manufacturers or
      prescribing physicians.

      The purpose of this study is to document the safety of the IBRF ACP/MCP and to establish its
      efficacy for those SDOC patients successfully completing treatment. The IBRF ACP/MCP employs
      a poly-pharmacological approach aimed at studying arousal states and outcomes in SDOC
      patients beyond those rates documented in literature.
