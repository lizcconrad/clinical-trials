      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and local tumor control of Embozene TANDEM
      Microspheres (40um TANDEM) loaded with Irinotecan to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma
      (mCRC).

    <textblock>
      Colon or rectal carcinoma that has spread to the liver is considered to be metastatic and is
      a Stage IV cancer. If the metastasized tumor is unresectable, the only current treatment is
      chemotherapy. Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as a palliative treatment
      in advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC), with the potential of local tumor
      control. TACE has evolved in the past 8 years to include drug-delivery devices that can
      target and deliver drugs from small microparticles (DEB-TACE). Superselective DEB-TACE has
      the potential to penetrate deeper into the tumor's vasculature to reach peripheral growing
      points. Loading these microparticles with a cytotoxic drug may improve the level of local
      tumor control.

      The MIRACLE III study is a controlled, pilot, single center (Italy) study on 18 subjects with
      pretreated non-resectable mCRC.
