  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to assess the appropriateness of the standard practice of a trial of nonoperative
      management for high grade small bowel obstruction (currently up to 72 hours based on
      available literature). The investigator will offer early laparoscopic enterolysis (within 24
      hours of admission) as the comparator group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel obstruction is a common disorder without a clearly superior management strategy.
      There are an estimated 300,000 surgeries performed annually with a health care expenditure
      burden in excess of 2.8 billion dollars. The investigators propose a new management paradigm
      including early laparoscopic management.

      Contemporary management of SBO includes a trial of nonoperative management (TNOM) reportedly
      with resolution in upwards of 70% of patients.

      Although it is one of the most common diagnosis for surgical admissions, there are few
      prospective, clinical trials to address the question surgical timing. Additionally, there are
      no prospective, randomized trials comparing early laparoscopy versus TNOM for high grade SBO.
      The hypothesis is that early laparoscopic enterolysis will result in decreased overall
      complications, shorter length of stay, decreased health care cost, and lower conversion rate
      to open laparotomy.

    <description>Patient randomized to the early laparoscopy arm will undergo diagnostic laparoscopy within 24 hours of admission (depending on surgeon and operating room availability). Standard laparoscopy will be performed including supine positioning, sequential compression devices, and appropriate pre-incision antibiotics. Trocar placement will be at the surgeon's discretion and as appropriate for the patient's previous incisions. The necessity for conversion will be left to the discretion of the attending surgeon. Post operative management will conform to the standards of care. Nasogastric tubes will not be routinely placed.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the trial of nonoperative management arm will undergo standard therapy including nil per os (NPO), nasogastric decompression only if actively vomiting, intravenous fluids while awaiting return of bowel function. Patients who do not achieve return of bowel function within 72 hours of admission will undergo attempted laparoscopic enterolysis with the understanding that conversion to open procedure may be necessary.</description>

    <intervention_name>Early laparoscopic enterolysis</intervention_name>
    <description>The surgeon will make about 3-4 small incisions in the participant's abdomen. A port (nozzle) is inserted into one of the slits, and carbon dioxide gas inflates the abdomen. A laparoscope is inserted through another port. The laparoscope looks like a telescope with a light and camera on the end so the surgeon can see inside the abdomen. Surgical instruments are placed in the other small openings and used to cut the scar tissue in order to relieve the obstruction. After all this has been accomplished, the carbon dioxide is released out of the abdomen through the slits, and then these sites are closed with sutures or staples, or covered with glue-like bandage and steri-strips.</description>
