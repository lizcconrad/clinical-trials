  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare the incidence of PNAC in newborns receiving cyclic versus
      continuous parenteral nutrition (PN) in those newborns who need prolonged PN. The secondary
      aims are to compare incidence of sepsis and catheter related sepsis, mean length of hospital
      stay, mortality, nutritional status at two years of chronological age and predisposing
      factors to the development of parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) between the
      two groups, and to evaluate the adverse effects of the method of cycling used.

      This was a single-center, prospective randomized not blinded study was conducted in a level 3
      neonatal intensive care unit from July 2010 to January 2015. Infants with hemodynamic
      instability until a stable situation, congenital hepatic disease, preterm infants with
      diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome or persistent ductus arteriosus and lack of
      authorization from the parents or guardians were excluded.

    <description>All newborn who were included in the study to receive cyclic parenteral nutrition (within 24 hours). The parenteral nutrition was stopped for one hour the first day until 4 hours in preterm infants and 6 hours in term neonates.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cyclic parenteral nutrition</intervention_name>
    <description>Cyclic parenteral nutrition was provided according to a method described by Longhurst et al. Patients were initially cycled of PN for 1 hour per day with increased rate of 1 hour with a maximum time out of PN of 4 hours for preterm babies &lt; 37 weeks GA and 6 hours for term newborns. Glucose was monitored at half the time without PN to detect the hypoglycemia.</description>
