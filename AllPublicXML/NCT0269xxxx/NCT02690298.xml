  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the ExSpiron™ can provide non-invasive, real-time, accurate
      measurements of minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) after
      calibration with a spirometer. The purpose of this study is to compare the MV, TV and RR
      values measured by the ExSpiron™ without prior spirometer calibration to values obtained with
      a spirometer calibration. In this study, the MV and TV values will be compared between the
      ExSpiron™ with and without prior patient-specific calibration of the ExSpiron™ to a
      spirometer

    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the performance of the device under the range of conditions encountered
      in the clinical environment, the respiratory volume monitor (RVM) was tested throughout a
      range of respiratory rates and also during erratic breathing patterns. At 4 and 36 breaths
      per minute (the extremes of the rates anticipated to be encountered in the clinical setting),
      and during erratic breathing, RVM and spirometry measurements were found to be
      highly-correlated (r=0.98 ±0.01 (mean ±95%CI) at 4 breaths/min, 0.97 ±0.01 at 36, and 0.93
      ±0.04 during erratic breathing). These studies also included calibration of the ExSpiron to
      the spirometer.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume
      (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) measurements collected and reported by the ExSpiron, without
      prior ExSpiron calibration, against acquired MV, TV, and RR measurements from an ExSpiron
      with prior individual specific calibration to a spirometer using either a Wright Spirometer
      or a Morgan Flow Volume Loop (FVL) Pneumotachograph Spirometer. A secondary objective will be
      to confirm the PadSet functionality after 24 hours of wear in accordance with current
      labeling.
