  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the frequency of GSTZ1 haplotypes in a
      healthy adult population and determine the pharmacokinetics of Dichloroacetate (DCA)
      metabolism based on haplotype analysis.

      The DCA drug is the first targeted treatment for Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
      (PDCD).

      This pilot study, focuses on developing a high throughput, sensitive and accurate screening
      test for determining glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) haplotype status in individuals
      who would be treated with DCA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency (PDCD) is a rare disease of mitochondrial
      energy failure with the life of expectancy of affected children severely truncated. Treatment
      of PDCD remains a serious, unmet challenge. Dichloroacetate (DCA) represents the first
      targeted therapy for PDCD by stimulating residual PDC activity. Cumulative experience with
      DCA has revealed dose accumulation in a subset of the population. This can be abated through
      personalized dosing of DCA, assigned by haplotype variation in the gene encoding glutathione
      transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), which biotransforms DCA to glyoxylate. Haplotype variations in
      GSTZ1 influence the kinetics and dynamics of chronically administered DCA. A single dose of
      DCA has a bioavailability approaching unity and is widely distributed throughout the body.
      The plasma half-life (t ½) is ~1 hr in drug-naïve subjects. Gender does not influence DCA
      kinetics or metabolism. The major route of biotransformation is via dehalogenation to
      glyoxylate by glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1). DCA is a mechanism-based inhibitor of
      GSTZ1, so repeated administration results in increased plasma t ½ and decreased clearance.

    <description>The TagMan-based genotyping technology will be used for GSTZ1 haplotype analysis from both blood and cheek samples. Haplotype variations in GSTZ1 influence the kinetics of chronically administered investigational medication DCA. The coding region of the GSTZ1 gene contains three functionally important non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that give rise to five major GSTZ1 haplotypes: KRT (Z1A), KGT (Z1B), EGT (Z1C), EGM (Z1D), and KGM (Z1F).</description>
