      This study evaluates the treatment of Dry Macular Degeneration and the resulting change in
      vision with a very, very low current that is similar to what occurs in the body naturally. In
      Phase 1, 16 participants will be treated, with half receiving treatment and half a sham (no
      treatment). After the treatment period of one week, those not treated will be treated. In
      Phase 2, all participants will be treated.

      The study will assess the effectiveness of transpalpebral micro-current electrical
      stimulation on improving the visual acuity in subjects with vision loss from Dry Macular
      Degeneration. The BioCurrent electrical stimulation will be applied by a device with the
      intended use of treating Dry Macular Degeneration (Nova Oculus ; The Eye Machine, Indian
      Wells, CA, U.S.A.). The device delivers a micro-current, an electrical current in the one
      millionth of an ampere range, to the retina in frequencies changing in a pre-defined pattern
      from 5Hz to 80Hz during each spot (40 sec). The device also incorporates a voltage limiter (a
      maximum of 245 micro A is possible) and a current level indicator. 200 micro A will be used.
      Very low electrical micro-current is delivered to the subject through the goggle probe.
