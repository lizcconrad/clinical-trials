  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of entinostat and pembrolizumab can be
      an effective treatment for patients with melanoma of the eye (uveal melanoma) that has spread
      to other sites of the body (metastatic disease). Pembrolizumab is an antibody that helps the
      immune system to attack cancer cells. Although pembrolizumab has proven clinical efficacy in
      treating patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma, an effect on metastatic uveal melanoma
      has not been established. Entinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has
      effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, thus potentially enhancing the
      effects of immunotherapy.
