    <description>Secukinumab 300 mg will be provided in 1 mL prefilled syringes of 150 mg. Each dose of 300 mg secukinumab will consist of two secukinumab 150 mg injections once weekly for 5 weeks (Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 8 through Week 48 inclusive. The patients (or caregivers) will self-inject each dose at the study site under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur on days of study visits. The injections not occurring on days of study visits will be done by the patients (or caregivers) at home.</description>
