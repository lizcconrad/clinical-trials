  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of concomitant antibiotics (CA) is a known risk factor for treatment failure
      in the treatment of CDI, as well as for recurrence of CDI. Recent data suggested that among
      patients receiving CA, fidaxomicin is superior vancomycin. While these data are encouraging,
      many clinicians remain unclear on how to apply these data to patient care. Additionally,
      patients were excluded from the trials presented to the FDA if it was expected that they
      would require ≥ 7 days of CA. Therefore, the clinical question still remains of how to apply
      these data to the real world patient who requires a long course of CA and develops CDI while
      on therapy. We therefore propose an open label, comparative and prospective study of
      fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily vs oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for the treatment
      of CDI among patients who are receiving a long course of CA.

      We hypothesize that fidaxomicin will be superior to vancomycin with respect to clinical cure
      for patients with CDI.
