      The aim of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic
      cells(DC) combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with advanced
      esophagus cancer. Experimental recombinant adenovirus coded mRNA including MUC1 and Survivin
      that transfected DC, which are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our
      previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the
      researcher plan to perform the clinical trial.
