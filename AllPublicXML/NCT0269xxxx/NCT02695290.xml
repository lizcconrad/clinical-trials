             chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption)

          -  Known or suspected active hepatitis B (Hep B) infection (defined as presence of HepB

          -  Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the
