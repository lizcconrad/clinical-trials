  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this study is to test the association between hyperoxia exposure after
      resuscitation from cardiac arrest and outcome. After obtaining written informed consent
      subjects enrolled in REOX II will undergo a rapid faction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
      optimization protocol to prevent exposure to hyperoxia. We will compare outcomes between
      subjects enrolled in REOX I (observational study only) and REOX II (intervention: rapid FiO2
      optimization protocol). Our overarching hypothesis is that exposure to hyperoxia after return
      of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is associated with increased oxidative stress and worsened
      neurological and cognitive outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1: Test if initiation of the rapid FiO2 optimization protocol following ROSC
      from cardiac arrest is associated with the degree of in vivo oxidative stress during the
      post-resuscitation phase of therapy.

      Approach: We will conduct a multicenter interventional study (FiO2 optimization protocol) of
      adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. We will record data pertaining to
      oxygenation parameters and other factors and measure biomarkers of oxidative stress
      [isoprostanes (IsoPs) and isofurans (IsoFs)] in the plasma at 0 and 6 hours after ROSC using
      gas chromatography negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. We will compare plasma
      IsoPs/IsoFs at each time point between subjects enrolled in REOX II (i.e. receive the study
      intervention, rapid FiO2 optimization) and REOX I (i.e. do not receive the study
      intervention) using t-test or Mann-Whitney U as appropriate with corrections for multiple
      comparisons.

      Specific Aim 2: Test if initiation of the rapid FiO2 optimization protocol following ROSC
      from cardiac arrest is associated with a decrease in neurological disability at hospital
      discharge.

      Approach: In the study described above, we will determine the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at
      hospital discharge. We will compare proportions of good neurological outcome [defined as a
      mRS â‰¤ 3] between subjects enrolled in REOX II (i.e. receive the study intervention, rapid
      FiO2 optimization) vs. those enrolled in REOX I (i.e. do not receive the study intervention),
      using binomial test.

      Specific Aim 3: Test if initiation of the rapid FiO2 optimization protocol following ROSC
      from cardiac arrest is associated with neuropsychological outcomes among survivors at 180
      days.

      Approach: In the study described above, we will assess neuropsychological outcome among
      survivors at 180 days. Neuropsychological testing will use validated instruments across five
      cognitive domains (attention, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV-digit span; (2) reasoning,
      Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV-similarities; (3) immediate and delayed memory, Wechsler
      Memory Scale-III-logical memory I and II; (4) verbal fluency, Controlled Oral Word
      Association Test; and (5) executive functioning, Hayling Sentence Completion Test). Among
      survivors, we will compare the 180-day neuropsychological measures (composite z-scores for
      each cognitive domain) between the same two groups using t-test or Mann-Whitney U as
      appropriate with corrections for multiple comparisons. We will also compare the proportions
      of patients able to return to work between the two groups using binomial test

    <description>We plan to test a protocol for FiO2 optimization for mechanically ventilated post-cardiac arrest subjects, with a therapeutic goal of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 60-99 mmHg, based on the PaO2 range that was associated with the lowest risk of poor outcome in our previously published work. We also use PaO2 (measured by arterial blood gas [ABG] analysis) as the ultimate goal rather than arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measured by pulse oximetry because an SaO2 value &lt;100% on pulse oximetry monitoring does not always exclude supranormal PaO2. The protocol in this application begins with very rapid reduction of FiO2 as much as possible according to SaO2 values, and when FiO2 is maximally reduced by SaO2 an ABG is measured, followed by finer adjustment of FiO2 to achieve a PaO2 60-99 mmHg. The protocol not only prescribes each downward titration of FiO2 but it also includes detailed limbs for upward titration of FiO2 to account for potential &quot;overshoot&quot; in FiO2 reduction.</description>
