  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia improves quality of recovery after surgery in many studies.
      Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block is a novel technique which may be a viable alternative
      to current regional anesthetic techniques. This randomized, controlled trial is to examine
      the effects of ultrasound-guided serratus plane block anesthetic on the QoR after breast
      tumor resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 72 subjects (36 patients for each groups) were enrolled in this study. Patients
      were allocated to either the general anesthesia group (group control) or SPB (serratus plane
      block) + general anesthesia groups (group SPB) using randomized central computer-generated
      sequence software (SAS 19.0). The allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Group
      assignment was concealed by opaque sticking envelops. The major research content is to
      evaluate the quality of recovery using 40 questionnaire (QoR-40).
