      Identification of the effects of spinal stabilization exercises and manual therapy methods on
      pain, function and quality of life in individuals with low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      113 patients participating in the study were divided into two groups. The patients in the
      physiotherapy group were instructed to perform special spinal stabilization exercises, while
      the patients in the manual therapy group were instructed to perform soft tissue
      mobilizations, muscle-energy techniques, joint mobilizations and/or manipulation methods
      depending on the nature of their lower back pain problems. Both groups were offered
      stabilization, strengthening, stretching, balance and exercise trainings as well as
      recommendations as to the daily life activities in line with the requirements of each
      individual. The severity of the pain suffered by the individuals was evaluated through a
      Visual Analog Scale. Oswestry Disability Index and Short Form-36 (SF-36) Scale were made
      respectively with respect to the functional condition and life quality. Assessments were
      repeated before and after the treatment.
