      Adductor canal block has become popular as effective mean for pain relief following knee
      surgery.This block has not been checked in chronic pain patients.The purpose of this study is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of adductor canal block on chronic knee pain in patients
      with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is serious epidemiologic problem. Knee prosthesis is successful treatment
      for many of patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis but there are important numbers of
      patients, which are not appropriate candidates for such surgery treatment. For them ,any
      treatment which could relieve pain in their knee would have good impact on quality of life.
      Adductor canal block is successfully used for relieving postoperative pain after knee
      surgery. Official approval from ethics committee of Republic Slovenia was obtained for this
      study. After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written
      informed consent will undergo an orthopedic examination and those with confirmed diagnosis of
      knee osteoarthritis lasted more than 6 months will be included in the study. Prior to start
      they filled Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome(KOOS) form and estimate maximal and
      minimal intensity of pain in the knee .They repeat self assessment of pain at the same manner
      using 11 point numeric rating score(NRS) 1 week and 1 month after blockade.Measurement of
      maximum voluntary isometric contraction of quadriceps muscle (MVIC) ,time up and go test(TUG)
      and 30s chair stand test are performed by physiotherapist before block of adductor canal on
      the ipsilateral leg ,1 hour,1 week and 1 month after block..Block of adductor canal is
      performed by the same and trained anesthesiologist at the proximal part of the leg using 14
      ml of Levobupivacaine and 100 mcg Clonidine mixed in the same syringe.At the conclusion of
      study patients filled the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome(KOOS) form once again.

    <description>KOOS is valid,reliable outcome measure in patients with knee osteoarthritis. usually used following knee surgery.This method is recognised as useful also in other and nonsurgical knee treatment.Shortened version widely used in North America is western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index(WOMAC)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of patient</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after block</time_frame>
    <description>We determine whether the patient is satisfied with the result of treatment by asking the following question: &quot;what is the least amount of success that the treatment would have to achieve by the end of the study and/or treatment for the patient to conclude that the treatment was worth it and the patient is satisfied?&quot;
The patient is asked to describe the minimum goal to be satisfied with the treatment in her own words, such as: &quot;50% reduction in pain, to go to the store without assistance, to use only one cane, to not wake up with pain, to perform regular housekeeping duties at home with minimal breaks, to walk a certain distance, or to play tennis&quot;.
At the end of the study the patient indicates whether that goal was achieved with a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer</description>

        all have alredy diagnosed knee osteoarthritis chronic pain.Diagnosis was confirmed(or not)
        from Ortopedist engaged in our study.Estimation of appropriatness was made by
        anesthesiologyst.
