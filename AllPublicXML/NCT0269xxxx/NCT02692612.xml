  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the age-related differences in force-velocity
      muscle characteristics during isolated knee extensions variable in speed and load, during
      cyclic movements on a usual and recumbent bike variable in speed and velocity development and
      a functional test battery with healthy participants aged between 20-80 years.
