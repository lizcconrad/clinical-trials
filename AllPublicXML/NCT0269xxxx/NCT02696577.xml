    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction is a common and complex obstetric problem. Intrauterine
      growth restriction is noted to affect approximately 10-15 % of pregnant women. Intrauterine
      growth restriction is diagnosed antenatal; however, some of these fetuses, especially if
      unscreened during pregnancy, may be detected only in the neonatal period. It is very
      important for obstetricians and perinatologists to identify growth restricted fetuses,
      because this fetal condition is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and
      mortality.

      Omega 3 is composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the third carbon
      atom from the end of the carbon chain. The fatty acids have two ends, the carboxylic acid
      end, which is considered the beginning of the chain, thus &quot;alpha&quot;, and the methyl end, which
      is considered the &quot;tail&quot; of the chain, thus &quot;omega.&quot; Omega3 improve fetal wellbeing by two
      mechanisms: Firstly, maternal and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation during pregnancy and
      lactation normalizes intrauterine growth restriction induced changes in adipose deposition
      and visceral PPARÎ³ expression. Secondly, maternal docosahexaenoic acid supplementation
      increases serum adiponectin, as well as adipose expression of adiponectin and adiponectin
      receptors. Novel findings suggest that maternal docosahexaenoic acid supplementation
      normalize adipose dysfunction and promote adiponectin-induced improvements in metabolic
      function in intrauterine growth restriction
