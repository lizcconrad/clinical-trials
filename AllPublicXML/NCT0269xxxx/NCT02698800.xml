  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Under entrained conditions, humans maintain a consolidated nocturnal sleep episode that
      coincides with environmental darkness and endogenous melatonin secretion. Various factors,
      such as artificial light, can compromise this temporal harmony, resulting in sleep
      disruption. Light is the strongest synchronizer of the circadian clock, with direct inputs
      via the retinohypothalamic tract to brain centers regulating sleep and circadian rhythms.
      Evening light exposure can suppress melatonin secretion and worsen sleep. This is critical,
      since most individuals routinely expose themselves to light before bedtime. The high
      sensitivity of the circadian system to blue wavelength light indicates that modern light
      sources such as light-emitting diodes (LED) may have particularly deleterious effects on
      sleep. It is possible to selectively filter out blue light while maintaining other visible
      spectra with blue-blocking (BB) lenses. Wearing BB lenses before bedtime may present a
      simple, affordable, and safe method to improve sleep. None have yet investigated the effects
      of BB lenses on subjective and objective sleep in insomnia patients, while simultaneously
      exploring the effects on melatonin secretion.

      This study seeks to investigate the impact of BB lenses on melatonin and sleep in insomnia
      patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, with the aim of developing a
      novel non-pharmacological approach for the treatment of insomnia. 15 individuals with
      insomnia will wear either BB or placebo (clear) lenses for 2 hours preceding bedtime while at
      home, for 1 week in a cross-over design. Sleep quality will be documented while at home, at
      also melatonin secretion while in the laboratory. It is predicted that compared to placebo,
      wearing BB lenses for 2 hours preceding bedtime will attenuate bright light associated
      melatonin suppression and improve sleep.
