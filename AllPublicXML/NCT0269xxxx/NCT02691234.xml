  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves for treating diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have been in evaluation for
      the past 5 years. Many researchers showed the effectiveness of Low intensity shockwaves of in
      accelerating the healing rate of non-ischemic chronic DFUs. Wang et al. showed, the use of
      Low intensity shockwaves on DFUs, significantly improved topical blood flow perfusion rate,
      increased cell proliferation and cell activity and decreased cell apoptosis.

      The present study deals with the effect of low intensity shockwaves on DFUs. Shockwave
      treatment will be done together with the standard conventional treatment for DFUs, compared
      to a control group who will receive the same conventional standard of care.

    <description>The treatment will be performed as an outpatient care procedure with no anesthesia. Patients will undergo wound debridement and cleansing before each treatment. The transducer device will be positioned against the lesion area and shockwaves will be delivered at a gradually increasing energy, with a maximum energy level of 0.09mJ/mm2</description>

    <description>The standard treatment to the control group and the treatment group will be performed as an outpatient care procedure with no anesthesia. Patients will undergo wound debridement and cleansing. The physician will treat the patient in regard to his medical state: antibiotic medication if needed, dressing and off loading with Orthotic devices</description>
