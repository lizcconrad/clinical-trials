  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains a significant public health problem and is increasingly prevalent among
      vulnerable groups. Appalachians have a high prevalence of tobacco use and are at increased
      risk for tobacco-attributable diseases. The efficacy of a scientifically valid tobacco
      cessation treatment delivered to Appalachian smokers remains untested. Also, little is known
      about the association of social-contextual factors that may modify or mediate the success of
      an intervention. These factors may be of particular relevance among disadvantaged smokers.
      Geographical patterns of tobacco exposure may also influence one's ability to quit,
      especially in pro- tobacco regions like Appalachia. The purposes of this application are to:
      1) evaluate the efficacy of a lay-led (LL) intervention in promoting long term abstinence
      from tobacco; and 2) examine the association between 12 month abstinence and selected
      individual, interpersonal, organizational, neighborhood and community, and societal factors
      among adult Appalachian tobacco users exposed to a tobacco cessation intervention. A third
      aim is exploratory and includes the characterization of activity patterns using space-time
      measures among adult Appalachian tobacco users exposed to a tobacco cessation intervention.
      Using a group randomized trial design, 707 Appalachian residents from 6 intervention and 6
      control counties will be randomly assigned by county to receive the LL intervention or a
      control condition which includes proactive telephone counseling via the Ohio Quit Line. LL
      group participants will receive face-to-face counseling, supervised by a county health
      department nurse, and delivered by a trained lay educator. A county Extension agent will
      assist with recruitment and retention efforts in this project. Social-contextual factors will
      be assessed at a baseline interview administered to all participants. Space-time activity
      geographical patterns of pro- and anti-tobacco exposures, or features, will be described
      among selected participants in four counties during weeks 1, 6 and 12 of treatment. At end of
      treatment and 6 and 12 months, LL and control group participants will be reassessed for
      tobacco use via self-report and cotinine-validation. Secondary analyses will explore
      differential trends over time between the two arms of the study. In a subset of the sample,
      pro- and anti-tobacco exposures will be estimated during weeks 1, 6 and 12 of treatment.
