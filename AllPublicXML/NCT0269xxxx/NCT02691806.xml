  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes, during strenuous aerobic activity, activity ceases only when the discomfort that
      follows lack of oxygen would be intolerable. Reaching this fatigue condition can cause organ
      damage, muscular damage and / or in different tissues of the body. In this study,
      investigators aim at developing new indexes, based on hemodynamics measurements from the
      peripheral micro - circulation system, for the benefit of early detection of fatigue during
      accelerated physical activity.

      14 healthy volunteers, 7 males and 7 females, aged 18-30 will participate in this study.The
      study includes 2 stages: In the first stage, aerobic capacity of the subjects will be
      measured by measuring maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max test). This phase will be conducted
      to determine physical measurements that could indicate different stages in muscle fatigue
      (anaerobic threshold, maximum oxygen consumption, heart rate and breathing indices).

      In the second phase, the subjects will perform the same physical effort protocol that carried
      out at the first stage. Non- invasive measurements of leg muscles activity during aerobic
      exercise and at rest (before and after activity), will be carried out using a wireless EMG.
      Additionally, hemodynamic measurements of oxygen levels in the skin and skin perfusion
      monitoring before and after strenuous activity will be performed using two optic sensors.
