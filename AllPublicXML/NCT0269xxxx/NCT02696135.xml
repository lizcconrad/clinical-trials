  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiac diseases, with
      a prevalence of ∼0.2%. Sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure and stroke are the major
      poor outcomes of HCM. Although about half of the patients were found to be caused by
      mutations mainly located in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, the causes in a significant
      proportion of patients with HCM are still unknown. Even in the patients with sarcomere
      mutations, the molecular pathways that eventually lead to cardiac hypertrophy are remained to
      be revealed. Furthermore, HCM presents with significant heterogeneity. SCD risk
      stratification and prevention by ICD are necessary. However, the strategy of SCD risk
      stratification recommended by the 2011 ACCF/AHA and 2014 ESC guidelines were based mainly on
      the evidence derived from American and European countries. The accuracy of these guidelines
      in Chines patients with HCM was not evaluated yet.

      In the present study, patients with HCM are recruited prospectively after informed consent
      was given. The investigator will collect the baseline clinical characteristics of the
      patients at enrollment, including comprehensive physical examination, laboratory testing of
      blood and urine, electrocardiography, 24-hr Holter, echocardiography, MRI and other
      examinations if necessary. The specimens retained include blood for all patients and
      myocardium for patients receive surgery of myocardial myectomy. Multi-omics screening,
      including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, will be performed
      to identified novel disease genes, signal pathway or processes, genetic risk factors and
      potential therapy targets of HCM. Furthermore, besides examining the accuracy of SCD risk
      prediction of the 2011 ACCF/AHA and 2014 ESC guidelines, we will identify novel risk factors
      associated with the clinical outcomes and construct predictive models suitable for Chinese
      patients with HCM.
