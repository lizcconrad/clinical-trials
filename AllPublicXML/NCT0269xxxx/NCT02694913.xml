  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, R01-funded pilot study that will identify serum and cellular
      markers in patients' blood samples that can be used as short-term biomarkers of rituximab
      response. We hypothesize that serum complement levels, activation of natural killer cells,
      and clearance of peripheral B-cells will be accurate biomarkers of rituximab response, and
      may be correlated with long-term outcomes.

      This study does not involve the administration of study drug. This study will only require
      additional blood draws to identify how patients respond to rituximab and other anti-CD20
      antibody therapy. It is expected that blood draws will occur on the same day in which an IV
      is placed to dose you with the anti-CD20 antibody or for other bloodwork being performed in
      order to avoid extra sticks.

      If you take part in this study, you will have additional blood drawn at the following
      time-points surround anti-CD20 antibody therapy:

      Pre Dose, Cycle 1

        -  Two 7.5 ml tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be taken along with your other
           pre-chemotherapy bloodwork Post Dose, Cycle 1

        -  Two 5 ml tubes (three teaspoons) of blood will be taken Pre Dose, Cycle 2

        -  Two 5 ml tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be taken Post Dose, Cycle 2

        -  Two 5 ml tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be taken Pre Dose, Cycle 6

        -  Two 10 ml tubes (four teaspoons) of blood will be taken Post Dose, Cycle 6

        -  Two 10 ml tubes (four teaspoons) of blood will be taken

      Note: Two tubes will be taken at each draw. If no blood was drawn in the prior 8 weeks, 10 ml
      of blood will be taken per tube. For the first 4 draws (at cycle 1 and cycle 2, pre- and
      post-), the amount of blood being taken is to ensure that the patient does not have more than
      50 ml of blood taken within an 8 week period.
