  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of the ALK/FAK/Pyk2 inhibitor CT-707 in patients with ALK-positive
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of CT-707 and evaluate whether CT-707
      is safe and has beneficial effects in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must be diagnosed with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The tumor must be ALK-positive
        as determined by ALK rearrangement in ≥15% of cells (as measured by FISH using the Vysis
        break-apart ALK probe) or by using the Ventana ALK IHC test. The analysis may be performed
        locally.

        RECIST v1.1

        Availability of tumor sample:

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are neurologically
        unstable or require increasing doses of steroids or local CNS-directed therapy to control
        their CNS disease Impaired cardiac function or any clinically significant cardiac disease
        Patients with abnormal laboratory values during screening and on day 1 of pre-dose
        Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the
        absorption of CT-707 Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase
        or lipase that was due to pancreatic disease.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
