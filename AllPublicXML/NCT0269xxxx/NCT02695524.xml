    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the effectiveness of adding neuromuscular exercises with tactile, visual
      and auditory feedback to a strengthening exercises protocol, both emphasizing the
      periscapular muscles on improvement of disability in patients with shoulder impingement
      compared to patients receiving only strengthening exercise protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence of the effectiveness conservative treatments in shoulder impingement are in favor
      the application of specific exercises for scapulothoracic muscles and rotator cuff on pain
      reduction and improvement of upper limb function, supervised or performed at home, and these
      same exercises associated with other therapies promote a greater reduction in pain and
      improvement in disability.

      There is a lack of clinical trials in the literature that evaluated the effectiveness of
      neuromuscular control focused on periscapular muscles. The few studies in this area have
      great methodological diversity with significant limitations. The hypothesis is that patients
      with shoulder impingement who will receive traditional exercise protocol with the addition of
      neuromuscular training will show less functional disability, a greater reduction in pain
      intensity, increase muscle strength and range of motion when compared to the patient group
      that will receive only the protocol without neuromuscular training, immediately after the
      intervention, four and eight weeks and four months after randomization and that these
      benefits are clinically relevant.
