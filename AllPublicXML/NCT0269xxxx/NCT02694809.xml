    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if taking the study drug, conjugated
      estrogens/bazedoxifene (Duavee®) causes any changes in the proliferation markers within the
      breast tissue of the study subjects. The study drug is approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration in healthy postmenopausal women to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as
      hot flashes. Since it is not approved in women with DCIS, its use in this study is
      experimental. This study will also look at whether taking the study drug causes any
      significant or undesirable side effects in women with DCIS. The researchers hope that this
      study will help them determine if taking the study drug is safe in women taking DCIS and if
      it can possibly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women with DCIS.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To assess whether CE/BZA (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene) for 28
      days +/- 7 days reduces proliferation as measured by marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67)
      protein expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether CE/BZA alters markers associated with progression to invasive cancer
      (abrogated response to cellular stress [ARCS] signature) in postmenopausal women with ductal
      carcinoma in situ [DCIS] compared to placebo).

      II. To assess changes in quality of life (QOL) using the Menopause-specific Quality of Life
      (MENQOL) questionnaire at baseline and at the conclusion of the intervention in women with
      DCIS treated with CE/BZA compared to placebo.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in the stromal marker cluster of differentiation (CD)36, in women with
      DCIS with CE/BZA compared to placebo.

      II. To assess changes in hormone receptor (estrogen receptor alpha [ERa] and progesterone
      receptor [PR]) expression in women with DCIS treated with CE/BZA compared to placebo.

      III. To assess changes in global gene expression profiling (ribonucleic acid [RNA]
      sequencing) in women with DCIS treated with CE/BZA compared to placebo.

      IV. To identify possible polymorphisms that may affect the metabolism of CE/BZA.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             diagnosis)

          -  DCIS suspicious for micro invasion is eligible on core biopsy; this is due to the fact
             that many these patients will not have invasion on final pathology

          -  DCIS must be greater than 1 cm based on extent of calcifications, presence of a mass
             on ultrasound OR enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

             cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (P-16), expression in
             immediately adjacent tissue is similar to what is found in DCIS

          -  Women must be postmenopausal (defined as no menstrual cycle for 12 months or surgical

             hazard to a fetus

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) and uridine
