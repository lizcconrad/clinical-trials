  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposed three-year (January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2018)
      project is to assess whether a program of widely accessed mobile phone-based text message
      interventions ('Happy Quit') will be effective at helping people in China who smoke, to quit.
      Based on the efficacy of previous studies in smoking cessation, it is hypothesized that
      'Happy Quit' will be an effective, feasible and affordable smoking cessation program in
      China.

      Background: Considering the extreme shortage of smoking cessation services in China, and the
      acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of mobile phone-based text message interventions for
      quitting smoking in other countries, here a study of &quot;the efficacy of mobile phone-based text
      message interventions ('Happy Quit') for smoking cessation in China&quot;has been proposed.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this proposed three-year (January 01, 2016 to December
      31, 2018) project is to assess whether a program of widely accessed mobile phone-based text
      message interventions ('Happy Quit') will be effective at helping people in China who smoke,
      to quit. Based on the efficacy of previous studies in smoking cessation, it is hypothesized
      that'Happy Quit' will be an effective, feasible and affordable smoking cessation program in
      China.

      Methods: In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China, about 2,000 smokers
      willing to make a quit attempt will be randomly allocated, using an independent telephone
      randomization system that includes a minimization algorithm balancing for sex (male, female),
      age (19-34 or &gt;34 years), educational level (≤ or &gt;12 years), and Fagerstrom score for
      nicotine addiction (≤5, &gt;5), to 'Happy Quit', comprising motivational messages and
      behavioral-change support, or to a control group that receives text messages unrelated to
      quitting.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be continuous smoking abstinence. A secondary
      outcome will be point prevalence of abstinence. Abstinence will be assessed by means of brief
      telephone interviews at six time points (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks post-intervention). A
      third outcome will be reductions in number of cigarettes smoked per day.

      Implications: The results will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between need
      and services received for smoking cessation interventions and tobacco use prevention in
      China. It will also serve as mHealth model for extending the public health significance of
      other interventions, such as mental health interventions.

    <description>Participants who allocate to this intervention group will receive regular, personalized text messages providing smoking cessation advice, support, and distraction. A quit day will be negotiated with each participant, and one to five messages will be sent per day for the time leading up to the quit day and the following 12 weeks.
One to three messages will be sent per week until the end of the 24 week follow up. In order to measure the main two outcomes (self-reported continuous smoking abstinence and point prevalence of abstinence), continuous smoking abstinence, point prevalence of abstinence, how many cigarettes per day during the last 4 weeks and past 1 week if they are still smoking, they will also be checked by phone call at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 week points.</description>

    <description>Control group participants only will receive one text message every week, thanking them for being in the study, providing study center contact details, and reminding them of the time until their free month at the end of follow up.

In order to measure the main two outcomes (self-reported continuous smoking abstinence and point prevalence of abstinence), continuous smoking abstinence, point prevalence of abstinence, how many cigarettes per day during the last 4 weeks and past 1 week if they are still smoking, they will also be checked by phone call at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 week points.</description>
