      This study seeks to assess the impact of the MenCare+/Bandebereho fathers'/couples' group
      education intervention on men's attitudes towards, and participation in, sexual and
      reproductive health, maternal, newborn and child health, and equitable and non-violent
      relationships with their children and partners. The MenCare+/ Bandebereho program is a
      multi-component comprehensive intervention being implemented by the Rwanda Men's Resource
      Center (RWAMREC) and Promundo-US, in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and
      local authorities in Karongi, Musanze, Nyaruguru and Rwamagana districts. The proposed study
      will evaluate one component of the program, a 15-session group education intervention
      targeting young fathers and mothers. The impact of the fathers' group education will be
      assessed through a randomized control trial design with an intervention arm of men and women
      participating in the father groups and a control arm of men and women who do not participate
      in the intervention. The study will collect quantitative and qualitative data over a period
      of approximately three years.

    <description>MenCare+/Bandebereho is a 3 year project to engage men in maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) and in sexual and reproductive health in Rwanda. A core component of the project is fathers'/couples' group education. The target participants are first-time parents or parents of young children living in 16 rural and semi-urban sectors selected by the implementing partner in collaboration with local authorities. The MenCare+/Bandebereho fathers'/couples' group education engages men in 15 weekly sessions of group discussion, critical reflection and interactive activities led by a trained facilitator using a curriculum developed by RWAMREC and Promundo and approved by the Rwandan Ministry of Health, adapted from the Program P Manual. Men's partners participate in 6-8 sessions. The sessions focus on men's role in MNCH, family planning, sharing household responsibilities, intimate partner violence, conflict resolution, family budgeting, and gender equality.</description>
