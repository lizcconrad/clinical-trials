  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAK-931 in participants with advanced nonhematologic tumors.

      The drug being under investigation in this study is called TAK-931. The effect of TAK-931 is
      being evaluated in up to 100 participants who have nonhematologic (solid) neoplasms. This
      study will look at the safety, tolerability, and PK to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of TAK-931.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall study duration is
      approximately 42 months for total of dose escalation cohorts and the safety expansion cohort.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with final visit approximately 30-40
      days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>TAK-931 30 mg, capsules, orally, QD or BID on Days 1-14 of each 21-day treatment cycle in dosing schedule A followed by dosing schedule B, C, D, E and F. In dosing schedules B through F, starting doses and dosing escalations will vary depending on the dosing data obtained from dosing in the previous schedule.
Dose escalation of TAK-931 will be based on evaluation of clinical safety and tolerability and guided by accumulating PK data. 3-4 dose cohorts are expected for each dosing schedule.
If the PK from the early cohorts support twice-daily (BID) dosing, then study drug administration in subsequent cohorts may transition to a BID dosing schedule.</description>
