  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective study is conducted with 151 patients who has a soft tissue defect of digit
      treated with the sensate flaps from February 2005 to March 2014. Based on the different
      regions of soft tissue defects, the patients in the study are divided into four groups: (1)
      thumb group treated with the bilaterally innervated and traditional kite flaps; (2) distal
      finger group treated with the single- and dual-innervated dorsal digital flaps; (3) proximal
      finger group treated with heterodigital neurocutaneous island flap; and (4) awkward region
      group treated with Litter flap. The main outcomes are static 2-point discrimination and
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the flap, and pain and patient satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      At final follow-up, sensory restoration of the flap is measured using the static 2PD test and
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Using the visual analogue scale (VAS) that consists of a
      10 cm line, patients are asked to report pain sensations of the recipient site. Patients
      report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the injured finger according to the
      Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that is based on a 5-point response scale.

    <description>We use a Disk-Criminator to test two nearby points when touching the flap. It is often tested with two sharp points during a neurological examination and is assumed to reflect how finely innervated an area of flap is.</description>
