  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) as per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of erdafitinib in a
      molecularly-defined subset of Asian participants with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter, phase
      2 study to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in
      Asian participants with advanced NSCLC, urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer and
      cholangiocarcinoma.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than (&lt;) 50% as assessed by
             echocardiography (or multi-gated acquisition [MUGA]) performed at Screening

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, poorly controlled
             hypertension or diabetes, ongoing active infection requiring antibiotics, psychiatric
