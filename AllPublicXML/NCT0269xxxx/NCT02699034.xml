      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the and performance of the Imricor Medical
      Systems, Inc. (Imricor) MR Ablation Catheter when used with related accessories for the
      treatment of type I atrial flutter. The Vision Ablation Catheter and its accessories have
      been designed for use under fluoroscopic or magnetic resonance guidance. The study will be a
      single center study conducted at the Leipzig University Hospital Heart Center in Germany. The
      study population will consist of adult patients requiring ablation for type I atrial flutter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single center study conducted at the Leipzig University Hospital Heart
      Center in Germany. 35 subjects including 5 roll-in subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will participate in the study. This study requires the use of investigational
      products from two independent manufacturers: Imricor and Philips. Imricor has developed the
      ablation catheter with related accessory cables and electrophysiology (EP)
      recorder/stimulator system. Philips has developed an image guidance and mapping system that
      is compatible with the Imricor products.

      The Vision-MR Ablation Catheter will be used in conjunction with the following
      investigational products: Advantage-MR EP Recorder/Stimulator, Vision-MR Ablation Cable Set,
      Vision-MR Diagnostic Cable, the interventional MRI Suite (iSuite) image guidance and mapping
      system, and a dStream Interface (dSIF-FE). With the exception of iSuite and dSIF-FE, which
      are manufactured by Philips, Imricor will provide all investigational devices used in the
      study.

      Each procedure will require two single-use Vision-MR Ablation Catheters and one each of the
      two single-use accessory catheter cables.

      Ablation for the treatment of arrhythmia is an inherently complex procedure. Use of the
      investigational products listed above under MR guidance is an emerging approach to performing
      the interventional electrophysiology procedure.

      The study population will consist of adult patients requiring ablation for type I atrial
      flutter.

      Study subjects will require a follow-up visit or telephone call at seven days post procedure.
      Accordingly, the expected total study duration is approximately 9 months with study start
      planned for March 2016.

    <description>Acute success defined as the demonstration of the established electrophysiological endpoint (e.g. bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block after radiofrequency application in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus) with the investigational device. Historically, the acute success rate for RF ablation of type I atrial flutter is 72%. Analysis will be based on a binomial proportion and expressed as a percentage. For a total of N subjects with S achieving success, the percentage, represented as P, will be calculated as P = 100*S/N.</description>

    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device or procedure. Analysis will be based on a binomial proportion and expressed as a percentage. For a total of N subjects with S experiencing an SAE related to the device or procedure, the percentage, represented as P, will be calculated as P = 100*S/N.</description>
