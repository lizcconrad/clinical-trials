        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             cancers known to express mesothelin on the tumor cell surface (e.g. predominantly

             ovarian cancer [including the fallopian tube or primary peritoneal], adenocarcinoma of
             the pancreas, triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast, non-small-cell

             [including the gastro-esophageal junction], colon cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, thymic
             carcinoma, etc.). Subjects with resected primary cancers who have documented
             metastases or local recurrence are eligible.

          -  Subjects must have no standard therapy available, or have actively refused standard
             therapy

          -  Subjects must meet the criteria for one of the 4 treatment groups:

               -  Group A: Adequate hepatic and renal function (controls)

               -  Group B: Mild hepatic impairment, i.e. Grade A according to the Child-Pugh
                  Classification (total score of 5 or 6) and adequate renal function

               -  Group C: Moderate hepatic impairment, i.e. Grade B according to the Child-Pugh
                  Classification (total score of 7, 8 or 9) and adequate renal function

               -  Group D: Moderate renal impairment, i.e. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration
                  rate) &lt;60 and ≥30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and hepatic function better than, or equal
                  to mild impairment according to the Child-Pugh Classification (total score ≤6)

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

             groups.

          -  Subjects who have a history or current evidence of bleeding disorder, i.e. any
             hemorrhage/bleeding event of CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events)
             Grade ≥2 bleeding within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine

          -  Subjects with corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the
             subjects to drug-induced corneal epitheliopathy or may interfere with diagnosis of
             treatment-emergent corneal epitheliopathy at the investigator's discretion in
             consultation with an ophthalmologist.

          -  Subjects who have received systemic anticancer therapy (except pemetrexed, cisplatin,
             carboplatin and topical or intracavitary treatments with negligible absorption in
             systemic circulation ) within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine, or
             within 5 half-lives of the anticancer agent before the start of anetumab ravtansine,
             whichever is longer. Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas must be excluded within 6 weeks
             before the start of anetumab ravtansine.

          -  Subjects who have received radiotherapy within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab
             ravtansine

          -  Use of drugs that, in the opinion of the investigator, have a strong potential for
             renal or hepatic toxicity within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until
             the EoT visit.

          -  Use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within
             2 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine until the EoT visit
