  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an
      inherited multisystemic disorder with recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and
      visceral arteriovenous malformations. The purpose of this study is to provide data about
      multiple clinical aspects of HHT and responses to treatment. For comparison of some aspects
      also data of non-affected relatives is collected (second cohort). the questionnaire has been
      designed primarily for web based entry, but can also be circulated in paper format on
      request.

    <measure>Effect of nasal self-packing to treat epistaxis on the quality of life in patients with HHT measured mainly by Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)</measure>

    <description>Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia is characterised by recurrent epistaxis which can lead to a feeling to lose control. The investigators examine whether the use of high volume low pressure nasal packing is a secure and practical method to improve patients' quality of life.</description>
