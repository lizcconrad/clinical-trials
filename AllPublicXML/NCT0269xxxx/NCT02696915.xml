  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fracture femur is a common injury which is associated with excruciating pain. Positioning for
      neuraxial blocks is always challenging because even slight overriding of the fracture ends is
      intensely painful .It can causing major patient distress which accompanied by well-known
      physiological sequelae such as sympathetic activation causing tachycardia, hypotension, and
      increased cardiac work that may compromise high-risk cardiac patients.

      Fascia iliaca compartment block is highly effective in blocking lateral cutaneous nerve of
      the thigh and femoral nerve. Fascia iliaca compartment block is not only easy to perform but
      it is also associated with minimal risk as the local anesthetic is injected at a safe
      distance from the femoral artery and femoral nerve. It is always safe to perform the fascia
      iliaca compartment block prior to spinal anesthesia as the patient can respond during
      administration of the local anesthetic and can prevent intra-neuronal injections

      On arrival to the pre-operative holding area half hour before the scheduled surgery. Patient
      will be connected to basal monitoring devices; pulse oximetry and non- invasive blood
      pressure. Fascia iliaca compartment block will be performed with the aid of ultrasound device
      in all cases.The injected local anesthetic solution will be prepared by a staff member who
      was not involved in the study) according to the randomization. After 20 minutes from the
      injection the investigators will assessed nerves that had been blocked.

      On arrival to the operative theater, under complete aseptic technique spinal anesthesia will
      be carried out in the sitting position (if there is severe pain at positioning we will use
      lateral position) at space between L3-4 or L4-5 using a 25-gauge spinal quincke needle. After
      feeling the desired space, the needle will be advanced (paramedian approach) till free flow
      of cerebrospinal fluid dropped from the needle then 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine+20mic
      fentanyl will be injected.
