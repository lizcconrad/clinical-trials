    <textblock>
      For behavioral health clinicians who are interested in getting tailored treatment and level
      of care recommendations, &quot;BH-CDS&quot; is a desktop/tablet web-based application that provides
      clinicians with data and a rationale for better decision-making to improve patient care.

      Few Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are available for Behavioral Health, and unlike
      existing CDS this product will compile relevant patient data and organize these data into
      general treatment recommendations linked to the patient's presenting circumstances, symptoms
      and substance use issues.

      The BH-CDS solution shall factor patient characteristics into a Latent Class Analysis (LCA)
      that will group patients according to their responses with other patients with similar
      responses (i.e., a subgroup or &quot;class&quot;). Once patients have been assigned to a class, the
      solution shall present recommendations to counselors that use the software.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clients' past 30-day substance use and psychosocial functioning at 1 month and 3 months post-baseline as measured by ASI-MV composite scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through ASI-MV composite scores at each time point. Composite Scores for the Addiction Severity Index - Multimedia Version (ASI-MV) are generated from a number of answered questions in each domain that refer to client behavior over the last 30 days. Therefore, they are useful for identifying changes in problem status and can be used in research and outcome evaluation.
