  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is mainly based on symptomatic
      treatments. The arrival of children in day hospital, every 2 to 3 months, is for many of them
      and those around them, stressful, rarely expressed, but noticeable by the care team. In line
      with the recommendations of the High Authority of Health, the multidisciplinary team of
      Resources and Skills Centre for Cystic Fibrosis (CRCM) Pediatric of Nantes University
      Hospital offers a therapeutic education program tailored to the needs of children with cystic
      fibrosis and their families . The aim is to support children and parents in the acquisition
      of self-care skills (knowledge and skills) and coping skills, such as managing stress and
      emotions . Our goal is to demonstrate that art therapy, mobilizing coping skills of the
      child, facilitates its expressive capabilities and reduces anxiety.

    <description>Parents and children will be informed at the inclusion visit (V0) that is a normal consultation under the care of the child.
The children included will be followed for 18 months with a maximum of 6 months without meeting art therapy sessions and 12 months with art therapy. The art therapy sessions will be scheduled during the usual consultations conducted as part of the care of children.
At each visit, clinical, paraclinical and external factors of anxiety will be collected and anxiety of parents and children will be measured using specific questionnaires.</description>
