    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study for subjects with
      cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) who have received Lenti-D Drug Product in Study ALD-102.

      After completing Study ALD-102 (approximately 2 years), eligible subjects will be followed
      for an additional 13 years for a total of 15 years post-drug product infusion. No
      investigational drug product will be administered in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of written informed consent for this study by the subject or subject's
             parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) and written informed assent by subject, if applicable

          -  Have received Lenti-D Drug Product in Study ALD-102

          -  Able to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Met the VCN discontinuation criterion from Study ALD-102, as follows: the subject has
             undetectable VCN (&lt;0.0003 copies per cell) in peripheral blood cells for 2 consecutive
             measurements at least 1 month apart and at least 12 months after drug product
             infusion. This exclusion criterion does not apply to subjects who received allo-HSCT
             after Lenti-D Drug Product infusion in Study ALD-102.
