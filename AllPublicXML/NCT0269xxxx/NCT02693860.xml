  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort and will receive two infusions of
      unlabeled huJ591 on days 1 and 14. 89Zr-J591 will be administered on day 21 (+ 1 day) and a
      positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) will be performed week later on day
      28 + 1 (visit 4). Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after the 2nd dose of J591, the patient will
      undergo radical prostatectomy with or without lymph node dissection (day 31 + 4 days). The
      final visit for the study will include a postoperative visit two weeks following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of huJ591 to
      trigger antibody−dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response manifested by a peri-tumoral
      inflammatory response with or without apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in patients
      diagnosed with either high or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. To participate the patients
      will be required to meet all eligibility criteria. Patients may not participate in other
      clinical trials while undergoing therapeutic treatment.

      The initial screening period (up to 28 days prior to start of treatment under this clinical
      trial) consists of visit to confirm eligibility, discuss the risks / benefits of
      participating in the trial and radical prostatectomy (with or without lymph node dissection),
      and obtain patient prostate biopsy samples for anti−prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
      expression review. An enrolled subject's participation in the study entails approximately 6
      to 7 weeks of therapy along with the additional 2 weeks time involved in recovery from a
      radical prostatectomy. Adverse events will be collected throughout the entirety of the study.
      The total duration of the patient being in the study can be around 9 to 11 weeks. Medical
      information/Survival information will be collected from the routine followup visits (standard
      of care) for up to 3 years after the surgery.
