  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a severe and debilitating anxiety disorder that is
      highly prevalent among older adults. Anxiety and GAD is a well-documented risk factor for the
      development of other severe conditions such as depression and dementia, and effective
      treatments are called for. However, recommended treatment for GAD has consistently been found
      to yield blunted response rates for older adults compared to younger patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of exercise-augmented cognitive
      behaviour therapy for older adults with GAD. Exercise augmented CBT is expected to yield
      better results than standard CBT in terms of greater reduction of symptoms and increased
      rates of remission. The investigators will also investigate the effects of treatment on
      biological, physiological and neuropsychological measures.
