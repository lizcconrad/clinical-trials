  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is recommended as first line treatment for pain control in osteoarthritis, but it
      is not included in list of drugs than can be prescribed in charge of National Health System
      by General Practitioners. The hypothesis is that removing this economical barrier the
      investigators can decrease the prescription of NSAID and of the Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI),
      often given for gastric bleeding prophylaxis in NSAID chronic users. As secondary outcome,
      opioids use was also monitored to see.

      Aim of the study is to test if allowing prescription of free paracetamol decreases the
      prescription of NSAID in osteoarthritic patients.

      The trial was conducted in two primary care units of the province of Reggio Emilia. The units
      have about 34.000 inhabitants. In this units 16 General Practitioners are active, the average
      beneficiaries per General Practitioner are 1500, about one fourth over 65 years old.
