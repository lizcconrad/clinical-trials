  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant personal and societal burden. The
      purpose of this study is to examine genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and brain activity
      changes related to PTSD dysfunction and recovery before and after treatment with Cognitive
      Processing Therapy.

      Using functional magnetic resonance imaging approaches, the present research aims to examine
      the relationship between traumatic experience and the neural mechanisms of various PTSD
      symptoms, and determine how this relationship changes during PTSD extinction. Also, this
      proposal aims to better understand how the genetic/epigenetic profile of several genes
      predicts, and perhaps changes, in response to recovery from PTSD along with its neural
      correlates. This understanding will help identify individuals who will respond most optimally
      to a specific empirically based PTSD treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy, while further
      connecting genetic biomarkers of risk with neural intermediate phenotypes underlying PTSD
      symptomatology.This study is observational as the investigator does not assign specific
      interventions to the participants of the study.

        Participants will include 102 individuals (half female) between the ages of 18 and 55 with
        a current diagnosis of PTSD as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
        (CAPS-5). Participants must have a history of chronic childhood trauma due to relational
        abuse. All participants will be recruited from the McLean Hospital outpatient trauma track
        Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) treatment program.
