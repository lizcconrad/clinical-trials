    <textblock>
      Systemic skeletal muscle atrophy (cachexia) is a typical side effect of chronic heart
      failure.

      Patients with cachexia can benefit from transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation
      (TENS). It is applied to strengthen the musculature and improve exercise tolerance and
      quality of life.

      It is unclear if application of TENS can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in patients
      with Optimizer® pacemaker systems for improvement of heart failure.

      This pilot safety study enrolled 6 patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left
      ventricular ejection fraction. All patients had an Optimizer® pacemaker system implanted for
      a minimum of 6 months, no patients had any ventricular arrhythmic episode 3 months prior to
      the study, and all were in clinically stable condition and willing to participate in this
      study.

      Neuromuscular stimulation was administered via TENS in 4 different modes (HF, LF, Burst, MF)
      on the right and left musculus trapezius and on both musculi quadriceps femoris. All patients
      were tested for EMI without or with cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) delivery of the
      Optimizer®-system respectively.

    <description>Electromagnetic interference can cause artificial sensing in pacemaker or ICD system. These artefacts may have the effect of suppressing the pacemaker pulses sensing of tachycardia in ICD.
The patients will be exposed to electrical stimulations, which will be of different forces on the neck and the upper thigh with r4x. These impulses and the effects will be noted down. It will be investigated if there is an interference with the optimizer ® depending on the different sites of the electrical stimulations and the different impulse forces.
Many patients with an Optimizer ® have simultaneously a pacemaker - or ICD implant. A special extra monitor will note if there are probable interferences with these pacemaker- or ICD implants.</description>
