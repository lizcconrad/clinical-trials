    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended in the treatment of recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The principle is to administer a fecal suspension of a
      healthy subject (donor) in the digestive tract of a patient with an CDI (receiver). Donors
      are being clinical and laboratory screening to reduce the likelihood of pathogens
      transmission (infectious and other). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is part of the examinations
      requested by the Agence national de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé in the
      context of clinical research. A sero-matching between donor and recipient CMV is requested.
      This recommendation eliminates many potential donors to a recipient. To date, the frequency
      detection level of CMV in stool in healthy volunteers with documented positive CMV serology
      is not known. In addition, CMV transmission risk via the stool is not established. This study
      aims to determine the detection frequency of CMV in healthy volunteers stool samples selected
      as potential donors for a FMT and having a positive CMV serology documented
