  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if an intervention of manual therapy and motor control
      exercises combined with an inspiratory muscle training program is more effective than an
      inspiratory muscle training program alone in increasing the maximum inspiratory pressure in
      patients with asthma. In addition, the study pretends to evaluate the changes caused by the
      intervention regarding possible postural changes and thoracic diameter.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Inspiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) was measured with a device called Kinetic KH1 Powerbreath in cmH2O. This device applies an inspiratory load which provides a resistance. The maneuver was performed in a sitting position. Measuring a minimum of 3 times was performed, recording the highest value</description>

    <measure>Head posture</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Head Posture at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The head posture was measured through the Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) device in centimetres. This instrument measures physiological movements of the cervical spine and head position. It´s a reliable method of measuring, providing a range of intra-meter reliability from 0.7 to 0.9 and a range of inter-meter reliability from 0.8 to 0.87. The evaluator instructed the patient to sit in a standardized position and assume a natural position of the head and the goniometer was placed over his head to measure the head posture.</description>

    <measure>Thoracic kyphosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Thoracic kyphosis at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the thoracic kyphosis was performed through flexicurve in degrees. It is a flexible rule that is molded to the back of the subject in order to replicate the shape of the spine. The flexicurve is a valid and reliable tool. The spinous processes of C7 and T12 were located, subsequently it placed on paper 10x10 to draw the curve and to obtained the index flexicurve.</description>

    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Volumes and lung capacities at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the Forced Vital Capacity was performed through a simple Spirometry.The Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society criteria and was measured in litres. The maneuver was performed 3 times and recording the best one.</description>

    <description>The measurement of the Forced Espiratory Volumen at first second was performed through a simple Spirometry.The Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society criteria and was measured in litres. The maneuver was performed 3 times and recording the best one.</description>

    <description>The IMT program consisted of supervised and domiciliary exercises:
- The supervised exercises was performed in the presence of physiotherapist. This consisted of 30 min 2 days for 6 weeks using the threshold device (Powerbreathe classic level 1, Gaiam Ltd; Southam, Warwickshire, UK). This program involve 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 30 seconds rest between each one. The load of the training was distributed as follow:
First week: 30% Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)
Second week: 40% MIP
Third week: 50% MIP
Fourth week: 50% MIP
Fifth week: 60% MIP
Sixth week: 60% MIP
- The domiciliary exercises consisted of Yoga Breathing Exercises (Pranayama) that combines the inspiration and expiration through one or both nostrils, and requires the activation of chest and abdomen.</description>

    <arm_group_label>IMT + Manual Therapy and Motor Control Exercise</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The protocol for this group is identical to the previous group with the sole difference that is added a manual therapy (MT) and a motor control exercises (MCE). The MT protocol was performed for 15min, whereas the MCE was 10min. Below it described both protocols:
- MT:
Upper cervical region mobilization in flexion
Lower cervical postero-anterior mobilization + maintained traction
Costovertebral joint postero-anterior mobilization
Thrust dorsal
Cervical postero-anterior mobilization
- MCE:
Isometric contraction of the deep neck flexors.
Isometric contraction of the neck extensors.
Neural self-mobilization.
Cervical retraction with theraband.
Sphinx.
Scapular adduction exercises in prone.
Scapular adduction exercises in sitting position with theraband.</description>
