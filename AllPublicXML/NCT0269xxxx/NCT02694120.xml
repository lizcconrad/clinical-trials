  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer,
      through the recognition and removal of pre-cancerous lesions, which in most cases evolve with
      a sequence that goes through formation of high-grade dysplasia (HGD).

      The probability of HGD increases with the increase of the lesion of the polyp itself.
      Lesions&gt; 2 cm are present in 1% of colonoscopy screening. The resection of these lesions
      presents a greater technical difficulty and consequently a decrease in the efficiency. The
      rate of incomplete resection reported in the literature reaches 10% while that of recurrence
      / residual adenoma 16.4 / 31.7%.

      The aim of the study SCALP is to evaluate the incidence of complications, efficacy and cost
      of endoscopic resection of colic lesions&gt; 2cm in a setting of clinical practice in an
      unselected population
