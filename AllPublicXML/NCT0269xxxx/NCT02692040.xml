    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Primary Objective

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of single doses of G3215 in overweight but
           otherwise healthy male subjects.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of G3215 in overweight male
           subjects with mild stable Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

      Secondary Objectives • To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and multiple
      ascending doses of G3215 in overweight but otherwise healthy male subjects or overweight /
      obese male subjects with mild stable Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

      Exploratory Objective

      • To investigate the effects of multiple doses of G3215 on food consumption, body weight,
      enteropancreatic hormone changes and glucose tolerance in overweight male subjects with mild
      Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.
