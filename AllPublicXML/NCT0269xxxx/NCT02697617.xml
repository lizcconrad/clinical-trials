      Pioglitazone is currently used in clinical practice to treat diabetes and this study will
      examine the potential use of a low dose of the same drug for the treatment of polycystic
      kidney disease. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the diabetes drug
      pioglitazone (Actos) is a safe and effective treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic
      kidney disease when treated in its early stages. Pioglitazone is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of diabetes. Pre-clinical models of polycystic kidney disease have shown that low
      dose treatment with pioglitazone decreases the growth of the cysts. The studies also suggest
      that effective pioglitazone dosing for polycystic kidney disease may be lower than that used
      to treat diabetes. The purpose of this study is to see if pioglitazone might slow cyst
      disease in humans.

      Patients will be randomize to placebo or 15 mg pioglitazone for 12 months, and then be
      crossed over to the other arm. Patients will undergo MRI of the liver and kidney and
      MRspectroscopy of the lumbar spine (if they choose as this is ancillary study) three times
      during the study. Assessments will be every 3 months and include blood work, blood pressure,
      and body water assessments.
