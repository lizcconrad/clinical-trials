  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess whether the application of a new hydrocellular
      polyurethane foam multilayer dressing shaped for the sacral area (MSP) in addition to
      standard care reduces the rate of pressure sores (PU) and their severity especially in the
      elderly population admitted for fragility Hip Fractures.

    <description>Standard care: PU risk assessment using the Braden scale within 24 hours of admission. Place patient on pressure mattress (static or alternating pressure) if Braden score &lt;18, daily inspection of the skin in the various pressure points and moving the patient every 4 hours after surgery. Management of possible incontinence, humidity control and prevention of skin damage and rubbing/friction during postural changes as per hospital procedure.</description>
