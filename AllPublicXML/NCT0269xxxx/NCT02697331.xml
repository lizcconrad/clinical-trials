      Aim of the work The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the use of vaginal
      progesterone as a method of prevention of preterm labour in twin gestations with short cervix
      .

      Study Design:

      The study is designed as randomized ,placebo-controlled, clinical trial . All women with
      dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy will be followed up in the antenatal care at the out
      patient clinic. Randomization of cases will be done by computer method . 130 women with
      dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy and cervical length 10mm to 25mm discovered on
      transvaginal sonogram between 20w to 24w gestational age will be enrolled in the study and
      will be distributed in two groups:group P (cases ) and group N (controls) . The randomization
      allocation will be 1 : 1 (vaginal progesterone capsule : placebo).

      allocation will be 1 : 1 (vaginal progesterone capsule : placebo).

      Inclusion Criteria :

      ( All pregnant women known to have Dichorionic Diamniotic twins diagnosed on 12 week dating
      scan will be offered transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess cervical length at 20-24 week
      anomaly scan ) and so inclusion criteria include:

        1. ( Dichorionic Diamniotic twins ) and both twins are living .

        2. (Short Cervix 10-25mm) Diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound scan between 20-24 weeks

      Exclusion Criteria :

        1. Cervical cerclage in place or planned .

        2. on tocolytic drugs .

        3. medically indicated preterm delivery &lt; 35w of gestation .

        4. known allergy to progesterone or peanuts ( as the active treatment contain peanut oil) .

        5. known contraindication to progesterone

             1. Liver dysfunction or disease

             2. Known or suspected malignancy of breast or genital organs

             3. Active thromboembolic disorder , or history of hormone-associated thromboembolic
                disorder

        6. known major structural or chromosomal fetal abnormality .

        7. Rupture of fetal membranes (leakage of amniotic fluid one or both sacs).

      1ry Outcome: Twin delivery at &lt; 36weeks of gestation.

      2ry Outcome:

        1. adverse neonatal outcome. Stillbirth ,neonatal death ,infant death before hospital
           discharge ,respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS) , intracranial haemorrhage (grade 3 or
           4)(IVH) , necrotising enterocolitis , (stage 2 or 3)(NEC), documented neonatal sepsis
           within 72 hr of birth , or periventricular leucomalacia (characteristic lesion in the
           subcortical white matter seen on cerebral imaging studies within 96 hrs of birth)(PVL).

        2. The risk of twin delivery at 35, 33 and 28 weeks of gestation .

        3. Preterm pre labour rupture of membranes (PPROM) .

        4. Hospital admission for tocolytic therapy .
