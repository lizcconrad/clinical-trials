  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is proposed to evaluate the role of motoric dysfunctions and burden of different
      kinds of refluxate on immune cells and the subsequent course of the disease. This study also
      aims to establish a bridge between instrumental findings (pH-impedance test) and clinical
      assessments (FSSG questionnaire), aiming to facilitate the use of simple questionnaire
      techniques in the clinical setting in the future.

    <intervention_name>Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy and collection of refluxate</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure should be performed on an empty stomach standard technique of anesthesia;10% lidocaine solution). The examination includes analysis of esophageal mucosa, expression of inflammatory changes, location, size, number of mucosal defects (erosions, ulcers, strictures, hemorrhages), as well as the appearance of the gastric and duodenal mucosa. . The modified Savary-Miller classification of esophagitis will be used to characterize changes in the esophageal mucosa. For morphological research and monocyte/macrophage phenotype assessment biopsy sampling of distal esophagus will be performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>24-h esophageal pH-impedance test with manometry-control of pH-transducer</intervention_name>
    <description>Procedure of pH impedancemetry includes intranasal introduction of a probe into oesophagus and connection of the probe with the recording device and 24-hour wearing of the probe.
Installation of the probe is carried out on an empty stomach. 24-h pH-impedance monitoring will be done in both distal oesophagus and in the stomach according to standard of practice. Esophageal pH sensor will be positioned 5 cm above the manometrically located border of the lower esophageal sphincter. Measurement with a second pH sensor in the stomach, 10cm below the lower esophageal sphincter in order to monitor intragastric acidity will be done as a standard routine procedure.
Standard measuring parameters will be collected: percent of time when pH is less than 4, total number of reflux episodes, number of acid and alkaline reflux episodes, duration of longest reflux episode.</description>
