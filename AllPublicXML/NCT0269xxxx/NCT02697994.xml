      ABSTRACT Introduction: In addition to pain caused by uterine contractions in labour, in 33%
      of women, continuous and severe back pain is observed. In management of this pain, sterile
      water injection is considered to be an effective method. Aim of this study is assessment of
      effectiveness and satisfaction of this method among Turkish women in which analgesic methods
      are not extensively used in labour and rates of cesarean section exponentially increases.

      Material and Methods: 168 termed, healthy women who admitted to Istanbul Gaziosmanpaşa-Taksim
      Training and Research Hospital with labour pain and had severe back pain were randomized into
      4x0.1 ml sterile water and 4xdry Injection groups. Injections were applied to Michaelis
      Rhomboid region in sacral region. Pain scores were assessed at 10th, 30th, 60th, 120th and
      180th minutes with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Additionally, need for epidural analgesia,
      APGAR score, mode of delivery, time of delivery, maternal satisfaction and breastfeeding
      scores were assessed.
