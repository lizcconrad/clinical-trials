  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to measure the effect of radiation therapy on the activity levels
      of patients. This will be achieved by tracking their activity levels during a treatment
      course of radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University of Pittsburgh (UPMC) St. Margaret and UPMC Shadyside, in the department of
      radiation oncology, breast, prostate, head and neck, and lung cancer patients will receive
      the standard treatment for their cancer and in no way will this study interfere with this
      treatment. Prior to initiation of radiation, consenting patients will be given Misfit
      activity tracking devices (accelerometers) to be worn on their wrist to track their activity
      levels throughout the course radiation therapy. Bracelets will be given to patients by the PI
      or co-investigators (MDs involved in patient's care) at date of consent and returned at
      completion of the study. The bracelets will track daily steps taken, calories burned, miles
      walked, and restful and restless sleep. Again, the purpose of the study is merely to measure
      the affect radiation therapy has on activity levels of patients.
