    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the persistence of anti-Hep B antibody at 9 to 10 years of
      age after the last priming dose in subjects who completed study A3L12 (NCT00401531), and also
      evaluate the immune response against hepatitis B one month after vaccination (challenge
      vaccination) with a stand alone monovalent hepatitis B vaccine.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the persistence of anti-hepatitis B antibody at 9 to 10 years of age after
           last priming dose in subjects having received hepatitis B vaccine at birth and a
           hexavalent vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age according to the vaccine received during
           A3L12 study (Hexaxim® [Group 1] or Infanrix® hexa [Group 2])

        -  To evaluate the immune response against hepatitis B one month after vaccination with a
           stand alone monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (challenge vaccination).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe serious adverse events (SAEs) reported throughout the trial after
           administration of hepatitis B vaccine.

      Subjects age 9 to 10 years who had received 3 injections of Hexaxim® or Infanrix® hexa and
      have completed the A3L12 study will be invited to participate in this study. They will
      receive one dose of Euvax-B® vaccine at Day 0.
