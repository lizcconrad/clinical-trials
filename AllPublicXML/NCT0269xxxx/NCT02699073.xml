    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of various tumor response criteria
      (Choi and RECIST1.1 criteria) in the assessment of regorafenib activity.

      Moreover, an assessment of the tumor heterogeneity will be made using computed tomographic
      texture analysis (CTTA)
