  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, a live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis vaccine,
      has been used to prevent tuberculosis for almost a century, and it is still the most used
      vaccine in the world. There is also circumstantial and indirect evidence that BCG vaccination
      can protect against malaria. Investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can offer
      protection against malaria in the Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) model.

      A total of 20 healthy male and female volunteers will participate in this randomized,
      single-blind clinical trial. Volunteers will be randomized to receive either BCG vaccination
      (BCG vaccine SSI) (group 1, n=10) or no treatment (group 2, n=10). Five weeks after
      vaccination of group 1 volunteers, all volunteers will undergo a CHMI administered by the
      bites of five P. falciparum infected Anopheles mosquitoes.

             telephone throughout the entire study period.

          5. Subject agrees to inform his/her general practitioner about participation in the study
             and to sign a request to release by the General Practitioner (GP), and medical
             specialist when necessary, any relevant medical information concerning possible
             contra-indications for participation in the study.

          6. The subject agrees to refrain from blood donation to Sanquin or for other purposes
             throughout the study period and for a defined period thereafter according to current
             Sanquin guidelines.

          7. For female subjects: subject agrees to use adequate contraception and not to
             breastfeed for the duration of study.

          8. Subject agrees to refrain from intensive physical exercise (disproportionate to the
