        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients in cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute myocardial infarction

        or

        Patients undergoing high risk coronary revascularization procedures (e.g., multi-vessel
        disease, left main, or last patent conduit interventions) in the catheterization lab.

        Cardiogenic shock is defined as

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for at least 30 min or

          -  Inotropes are needed to maintain blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg or

          -  Clinical signs of heart insufficiency with pulmonary congestion or

          -  Signs of end organ hypoperfusion with at least one of the following criteria:

          -  Altered mental status

          -  cold, damp skin or extremities

          -  oliguria (≤ 30 mL/h)

          -  serum lactate &gt; 2.0 mmol/L

        Written consent of the patient or the legal caregiver

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 85 years

          -  Cardiac arrest out of hospital with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) &gt; 10 min

          -  Coma with fixed pupils not induced by drugs;

          -  Mechanical causes for cardiogenic shock (ventricular septal defect of papillary muscle
             rupture)

          -  Non-cardiogenic causes of shock (bradycardia, sepsis, hypovolemia, etc.)

          -  Fever (Body temperature &gt; 38.0 °C) or other evidence of sepsis

          -  Onset of cardiogenic shock &gt; 6 h before enrollment;

          -  Lactate &gt; 22 mmol/L;

          -  Massive pulmonary embolism;

          -  Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease precluding insertion of femoral arterial
             or venous catheters

          -  Previous known aortic regurgitation greater than grade II

          -  Contra-indications for anticoagulation

          -  Severe hemolysis of any cause

          -  Patient is participating in an investigational drug or device study trial that has not
             reached the primary endpoint or that interferes with the current study endpoints.
