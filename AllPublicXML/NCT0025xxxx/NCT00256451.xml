  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand the relationship between what an individual
      inherited from their family (genetics), how they respond and feel after drinking alcohol, and
      how they respond to pre-treatment with naltrexone, a medication that blocks some of the
      effects of alcohol and is approved for the treatment of alcoholism. The investigators are
      conducting this study on those of African descent because there is almost no research focused
      on this group and the association with genetics. The investigators seek to enroll 40 people
      in the study. Participation will consist of 4 different alcohol challenge sessions. Each
      session will be separated by at least 10 days. In total, there will be four challenge
      sessions.

      We propose to test the degree to which specific genetic markers alter the relationship
      between subjective and objective measures of response to alcohol ingestion among non-alcohol
      dependent adults of African descent in a laboratory environment. To meet this aim,
      non-alcohol dependent adults of African descent will be recruited for participation to meet
      the N-goal of 40 trial completers. After consenting, genotyping, and completing the baseline
      assessment, they will participate in four separate alcohol challenge sessions separated by at
      least 10 days. During each of the sessions, subjects will be administered alcohol or sham
      drinking challenge sessions and pretreatment with either naltrexone (50 mg/day) or placebo in
      a double-blind fashion. The order of the four sessions will be randomly assigned. During each
      session, physiological and subjective response will be measured. We will select subjects to
      assure equal number of participants with at least one copy of the Val6 allele compared to
      those homozygous for the Ala6 allele.
