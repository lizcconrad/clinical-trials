  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, placebo-controlled
      study of tesaglitazar (0.5 and 1 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes, not adequately
      controlled on diet and lifestyle advice alone during the run-in period. The study comprises a
      6-week single-blind placebo run-in period followed by 24-week treatment period and a 3-week
      follow-up period.

      The study design of GALLANT 2 is identical to GALLANT 22; the blinded study data from GALLANT
      2 will be transferred to the GALLANT 22 database and will be analyzed together with the data
      from GALLANT 22 clinical study.
