  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected with non-Hodgkin’s large B-cell lymphoma are treated by chemotherapy. The
      evaluation of the response to this treatment is made by Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT)
      in many centres where this technology is available. Presently PET scans and CT scans are
      being performed before treatment, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy and a few months after the
      end of treatment.

      The goal of this study is to determine if it is possible to evaluate the efficiency of
      chemotherapy treatments after one cycle of treatment instead of waiting after 4 cycles, using
      a new scanner that combines PET and CT modalities. Data available from studies on these
      combined exams suggest that PET/CT helps to rapidly evaluate the response of the chemotherapy
      treatment. We also want to verify if some pathological characteristics measured from tumor
      cells will enable doctors to predict in advance the response to treatment.

      Participation in this study involves 4 PET/CT exams, which occur before the treatments start,
      after the first cycle of chemotherapy, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy and then 12 weeks after
      the end of the treatments. The only additional test performed in this study compared to the
      regular follow-up of patients that are not in this study is the PET/CT exam after the first
      cycle. Your participation in this study will not affect treatment since the results of the
      first PET/CT test will not be communicated. All other tests results will be available in the
      medical record.
