  <brief_summary>

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare two surgical treatments for perforated
      necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight babies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized clinical trial comparing laparotomy vs peritoneal drainage
      for perforated Necrotizing Enterocolitis. The current literature does not allow an objective
      comparison between these two methods. A recent comprehensive meta-analysis of all published
      and much unpublished data regarding the use of these procedures in the treatment of
      perforated NEC revealed that the degree of bias in assignment to treatment precluded an
      adequate determination as to the best treatment. The conclusion that only a randomized
      clinical trial would answer this question has led to this multi-center effort. The relative
      infrequency of the disease at any one neonatal center has necessitated enrollment of patients
      at many centers.

      Comparison: Premature neonates weighing less than 1500 grams at birth who develop perforated
      necrotizing enterocolitis are randomized within two birth weight blocks (&lt;1000 gms and 1000 -
      1499 gms) for treatment with either laparotomy or primary peritoneal drainage. Daily
      postoperative clinical care is kept uniform between the two groups by means of a critical
      care pathway. The primary outcome variable is mortality, i.e. death within 90 days of
      intervention. The main secondary outcome is short bowel syndrome - defined as the need for
      chronic parenteral nutrition greater than 3 months following operation.
