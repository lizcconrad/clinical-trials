    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept (POC) single arm study of GW640385, a protease inhibitor, in
      combination with RTV and 2 or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)
      backbone. This study has a 48 week duration and is open to both treatment naive and
      experienced patients who are HIV positive. There are 3 intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) visits.
