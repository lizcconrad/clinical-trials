      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect or fortifying milk with pre and probiotics or
      with micronutrients on prevention of diarrhea, pneumonia and other childhood illnesses and
      improvement in growth and development.

      The 1993 World Bank World Development Report (1) delivered a strong but sad reminder of the
      dramatic scale of suffering and death among preschool children attributable to pneumonia
      (2.7million in 1990) and diarrhea (another 2.5million deaths). In terms of “disability
      adjusted life years” (DALYS) lost, in 0-4 years old children, respiratory infections account
      for 18.5% and 17.6% (in boys &amp; girls respectively) and diarrhea accounts of another 16.2% and
      15.7% respectively. The development of effective interventions to reduce morbidity from these
      illnesses has become a humanitarian, economic and political imperative and essential in
      achieving the morbidity and mortality reduction goals that the “World Summit for Children”
      set a decade ago. Therapy with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) for diarrhea, a cornerstone of
      the universal strategy for child survival, has low compliance due to having no effect on
      duration of diarrhea and has mixed impact on child mortality (2-5). Present strategies for
      containing morbidity and mortality due to respiratory infection focuses primarily on
      antibiotic treatment. Increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains, poses a problem
      with the current strategy. Lack of any truly effective and affordable preventive vaccine, for
      both diarrhea and pneumonia has aroused considerable interest in food based preventive
      interventions. In the recent years increasing recognition and evidence regarding the role of
      Probiotics, and micronutrients like Zinc, as both preventive and therapeutic agents against
      infections has made them a potential and promising candidate. This study is in fact two trial
      run concurrently with two milk preparation one fortified with pre and Probiotics and second
      fortified with micronutrients and each having same milk unfortified as control.
