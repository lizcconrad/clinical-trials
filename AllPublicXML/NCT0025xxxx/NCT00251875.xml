  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a randomized, prospective cohort design to assess the impact of shared online
      health records on 1) patient safety, 2) health goal adherence and outcomes, 3) documentation
      of family history, and 4) barriers to the adoption of patient-physician communication
      technology.

      Hypothesis: the respective interventions will result in 1) improved patient safety 2) greater
      adherence to health care maintenance and chronic disease guidelines 3) more accurate
      documentation of family history 4) the identification of technology adoption enablers and
      barriers.

      During the first phase of the study, primary care practice patients continue to receive
      “usual care” while their physician’s offices are using Patient Gateway, an Internet portal
      offering secure messaging, common requests, chart information, and health information that
      has already been developed. Also in this first phase, all patients using Patient Gateway will
      receive an electronic letter explaining the research study and a link to an electronic
      consent form. In addition to recruitment of subjects, phase 1 allows for baseline data to be
      collected.

      In the second phase, study clinics will be randomized into one of two intervention “arms”.
      Study subjects whose clinics are randomized into Arm 1 will be invited to review and comment
      on their medication, allergy, and diabetes information through Patient Gateway; they can then
      submit this information to their primary care physician for review. Those randomized into Arm
      2 will report on their health maintenance status and family history and submit this
      information to their primary care physician through Patient Gateway prior to a scheduled
      visit. Chart reviews performed at the end of Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be conducted to
      identify differences in process measures and outcome measures between intervention and
      control groups.

      In addition, a medication phone survey sub-study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of
      the new Patient Gateway features on medication management.
