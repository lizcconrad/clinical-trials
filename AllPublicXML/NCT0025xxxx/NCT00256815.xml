  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed for subjects whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot be
      operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. At this stage of the disease, most
      subjects cannot be cured from the disease, however, treatment can help subjects to live
      longer and better by keeping the cancer under control. All treatment offered to is primarily
      pursuing that goal. Subjects at this stage of their disease traditionally receive radiation
      therapy or chemotherapy, both treatments in succession or both concurrently. Recently, the
      administration of both methods of treatment concurrently has been employed and indicate
      somewhat better results. Specifically, a class of chemotherapy agents called Vinca Alakaloids
      used in combination with radiation therapy appear promising as determined in small studies.
      The drug Navelbine is part of this class of drugs. This drug is approved as an infusion
      through the veins. The pill form is under development and will be used in this form in this
      treatment program.

      For this protocol, radiation will be administered using a schedule which is more convenient
      for patients, by once weekly chest irradiation for a total of 12 weeks. Use of this schedule
      was determined to be as good as the more commonly used daily radiotherapy. The once weekly
      schedule is less cumbersome as it involves less visits. The rationale and reason why you are
      being asked to participate in this program is to study whether the drug Navelbine can be
      given together with the once weekly radiation schedule. Radiation will be administered in two
      fractions, 6 hours apart on one day. For this program, the drug Navelbine would be made
      available as a pill, and would not have to be infused through the vein. The proposed protocol
      will use increasing doses of the drug Navelbine in pill form to find the highest dose of
      Navelbine that is tolerated in conjunction with radiation therapy. Initially, each subject
      will receive one dose of Navelbine, which is higher than the dose of the previous subject.
      This escalation will continue until the highest tolerated dose has been determined.

      The administration via pill would be easier and avoid previously experienced side effects
      that were experienced by infusion into the veins of subjects, such as burning and sores at
      the infusion site.

      35 patients with advanced NSCLC will be enrolled (stages III and IV) and treated once per
      week in two fractions for a total of 12 cycles using a previous prescription developed by
      Salazar et al to a total of 6000 rad.

      Treatment will be given to a large field with a 2-3 cm tumor margin. All involved or
      suspicious nodal areas will be radiated as well. The drug Navelbine will be given in a dose
      escalation on the same day the radiation is administered. The starting dose for Navelbine
      will be 20 mg/m2 and the escalation will be in 10 mg increments.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC. Histology may include adenocarcinoma,
             squamous cell, large cell undifferentiated, but no bronchoalveolar carcinoma, small
             cell or carcinoid.

          2. Locally advanced NSCLC disease (Stage IIIa or IIIb) or metastatic disease (Stage IV)

          3. ECOG performance status 0-2 (See Appendix 1 )

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Absoloute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 / mm3 ,platelet count &gt; 100,000/ mm3

          6. Serum bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 X ULN if alkaline
             phosphatase is &lt; ULN. Alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 X ULN if transaminases are &lt;
             ULN.
