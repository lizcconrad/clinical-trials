  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel (Plavix), a platelet ADP receptor antagonist, has become the standard of care to
      prevent thrombosis in interventional cardiology and is increasingly being used in unstable
      angina and NSTEMI. An increasing number of patients are referred to emergent or urgent CABG,
      and several studies, as well as our own experience, have shown that preoperative
      administration of irreversible platelets inhibitors increase the risk of bleeding
      complications following CABG.

      Aprotinine (Trasylol) is a potent antifibrinolytic agent known to reduce bleeding after
      cardiac surgery. The most commeon practice is to give Trasylol in high doses immediately
      before surgery, during the operation, and during the first postoperative hours. However, it
      has also been shown that there is a hemostatic effect of the drug when given in a lower dose
      postoperatively, but this remains unclear.
