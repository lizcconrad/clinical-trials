      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of saredutant (or SR48968C) in
      adult and elderly patients with depression.The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term
      safety and tolerability of a 100 mg dose of saredutant in adult and elderly patients with
      depression. The secondary objective is to evaluate blood levels of saredutant.

      The study is a multicenter, US, open-label study consisting of two segments (A and B).
      Segment A is a minimum 1-week (maximum 4-week) screening period and Segment B is a 52-week,
      open-label period. All treated patients must complete a post-study telephone visit and a
      post-study office visit 3 days and 1 week, respectively, after intake of the last dose of
      study medication.
