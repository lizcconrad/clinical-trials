    <textblock>
      Assisted living is rapidly becoming one of the most common methods of caring for older adults
      with dementia in long-term care. Over half of assisted living residents have dementia and
      many exhibit affective and behavioral problems related to the condition; residents' care and
      quality of life may suffer as a result of these problems. Despite the seriousness of this
      condition, interventions to teach direct care staff how to care for these residents are
      limited. This study will develop a program for teaching assisted living staff how to deal
      with the issues of patients with dementia and reduce mood and behavioral problems among this
      population.

      Caregivers will be randomly assigned to attend skills training sessions as two 4-hour
      workshops, four 30 minute individual training sessions, or two 30 minute in-services.
      Training will focus on dementia, depression and anxiety, the incidence of behavior problems,
      and skills and techniques for alleviating care challenges associated with behavior problems.
      Caregivers will complete self-report scales and questionnaires at the beginning and at the
      end of the study; these measures will assess job satisfaction, reactions to resident
      behavioral problems, and job skills. Residents will also be recruited for this study; they
      will complete questionnaires about their depressive episodes, anxiety, behavioral problems,
      and quality of life at the beginning and at the end of the study.
