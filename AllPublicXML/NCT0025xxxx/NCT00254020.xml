  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common and often serious problem occurring in stroke patients. Inflammatory
      hormones, known as cytokines, are stimulated by an activated immune system and sometimes
      become active following a stroke. They may be responsible for altering levels of key
      neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the blood and brain of stroke patients. The
      investigators' objective is to examine whether increased cytokine activity following a stroke
      may be the cause of an increased presence or severity of depression or cognitive impairment
      among stroke patients, as a result of tryptophan depletion and/or kynurenine activation. They
      are recruiting patients within one month of their strokes and measuring levels of key markers
      in their blood. Patients are assessed for the presence of depressive and/or cognitive
      symptoms and treated with an antidepressant if needed. The investigators expect to show that
      cytokine activation is related to depression and/or cognitive impairment among stroke
      patients.
