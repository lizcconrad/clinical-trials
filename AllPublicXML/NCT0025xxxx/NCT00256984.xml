  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine how effective and how durable STARR
      (stapled transanal rectal resection) surgery is in relieving symptoms of intractable
      constipation associated with obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectocele and rectal intussusception are frequent findings in women but are often
      asymptomatic apart from anatomical defects, which can be seen on vaginal examination. They
      can be associated, however, with refractory constipation that may be best described by the
      terms &quot;Outlet Obstruction&quot; or &quot;Obstructive Defecation Syndrome (ODS)&quot;. ODS is characterized
      by a symptom complex, including the feeling of incomplete evacuation associated with the need
      to strain excessively and for external assistance (digital, mechanical or positional
      maneuvers, enemas or suppositories) to aid defecation. Abdominal or rectal pain is also a
      common complaint. Obstetric trauma is also recognized as a contributing factor. However, none
      of these symptoms/factors can be singled out to be pathognomonic for this problem. ODS has a
      prevalence of approximately 12% in the general population.

      For individuals with ODS and related intussusception/rectocele, a variety of surgical
      techniques including abdominal, vaginal, transanal and perineal approaches have been devised.
      The impact of clinical studies to evaluate these techniques has been limited by variability
      of results and lack of comparators. Recently, a new surgical approach was developed by an
      Italian surgeon, A. Longo, and has been evaluated in several European centers. These early
      studies and observations indicate that this new procedure may in fact provide significantly
      better symptom resolution in ODS patients than other available treatments, and warrants
      further study. The procedure is referred to as &quot;Stapled Transanal Rectal Resection (STARR)&quot;
      and this study will assess its effectiveness in a United States population.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of change in Obstructive Defecation Syndrome (ODS) symptom composite score from baseline at 1 month post procedure. This score is based on a series of questions designed to understand the extent ODS effects an individual's daily lifestyle (0 is worst score, 24 is best score). Sizing consistent with primary outcome; analysis was per-protocol.</description>

    <description>Assessed as patient-reported assessment of symptom severity and frequency (PAC-SYM)associated with constipation. Patient response options are absent, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe.12 questions relate to severity, 8 questions relate to frequency of symptoms. The lower the score, the less severe the symptoms. Sizing consistent with primary outcome; analysis was per-protocol.</description>

    <description>PAC-QOL is Patient Assessment of Constipation, Quality of Life. The instrument consists of 28 questions on a 0-4 scale. A lower score indicates better quality of life. The score is a number without units.Change from baseline in patient assessment of constipation in quality of life as measured by the PAC QOL instrument score. The questions are designed to measure the impact constipation has had on daily life during the week prior to the subject visit.

    <description>The SF-12 is a validated 12 question quality-of-life questionnaire. The SF-12 extracts 12 items from the SF-36 questionnaire in two six-item subscales, PCS (physical functioning) and MCS (emotional functioning). The SF-12 scores can range from 10 (maximum impairment) to 70 (no impairment). For this study, the endpoint is the percentage of change from baseline over 12 months post procedure.</description>

          <description>Based upon Obstructed Defecation Syndrome (ODS) questionnaire. This questionnaire has eight questions, each dealing with frequency of a particular attribute associated with ODS (mechanical, difficulties to evacuate, digitation to evacuate, return to toilet to evacuate, feeling of incomplete evacuation, straining to evacuate, time needed to evacuate, and lifestyle alterations). Each is scored 0-3 (low to high on scale, no units. &quot;0&quot; is the lowest frequency of occurrence, &quot;3&quot; is the highest frequency of occurrence; the total of all attributes (0-24) is the final score.</description>

The SF-12 scores can range from 10 (maximum impairment) to 70 (no impairment). For this study, the endpoint is the percentage of change from baseline over 12 months post procedure.</description>
