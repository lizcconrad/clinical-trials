      To determine the overall response rate to liposomal 9-Nitro-20 (S)-Camptothecin (L9NC)
      administered by aerosolization in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (any stage.

      To determine toxicity profile of L9NC administered by aerosolization for 5 consecutive days
      per week X 8 weeks, every 10 weeks.

      To perform a pharmacology study of L9NC in the plasma, and the lungs after aerosolization. A
      specific protocol will be written for this part.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized Phase II trial of DLPC-9NC administered by aerosol 5
      consecutive days per week for 8 weeks every 10 weeks.

      Dose: 0.4 mg/ml of 9-NC in aerosol reservoir for 60 minutes (= daily dose of 0.52 mg/m2/day)
      per day X5 every week, X8 weeks, then observe for 2 weeks. One course = 10 weeks.

      Patients that have a resectable lung cancer will only receive one course of treatment and
      will be operated on about two weeks after completing the 8-week course.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients, 18 years of age or older, with resectable lung cancer (any stage) or
             stage 3b, 4, or recurrent, nonresectable, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, who have
             failed standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy for their disease or who refuse standard
             therapy are eligible.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent.

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count of &gt;1,500 or cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 and absence
             of a regular red blood cell transfusion requirement.

          -  Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and
             SGOT or SGPT &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as
             defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients must not have a known symptomatic respiratory disease other than cancer, and
             must have a pulmonary function test equal to &gt;50% FEV1, &gt;50% FEV1/FVC, &gt;50% TLC, and
             &gt;50% DLCO of predicted values.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child
             bearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this
             trial.

          -  Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or
             cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Any criteria that is borderline and may lead to ineligibility will be reviewed by the
             PI, who may override the eligibility criteria, after receiving sponsor agreement, if
             entry into the study is deemed to potentially benefit the patient.
