  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a food portion control tool would be
      effective to result in weight loss in a group of overweight type 2 diabetics. We hypothesized
      that this tool would be effective to induce weight loss in these patients. We also
      hypothesized that diabetic control would be improved in patients using these plates.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Portion size is known to be an important
      determinant of energy intake. However, to our knowledge, no clinical trials have previously
      been conducted which examine the efficacy of a food portion control tool to control caloric
      intake and thereby induce weight loss.

      Most cases of type 2 diabetes can be attributed directly to obesity. Dietary caloric
      restriction has been shown to improve glycemic control by virtue of weight loss, with an
      additional benefit independent of weight loss.

      Comparison: daily use of a food portion control tool plus usual care at a diabetes care
      center, compared to usual care alone.
