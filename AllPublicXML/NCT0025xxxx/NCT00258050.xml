    <textblock>
      To characterize the effect of repeat oral dose of lapatinib treatment on the pharmacokinetics
      of a single oral and single intravenous dose of midazolam in adult cancer patients. Also to

    <description>In Part 1 of the study, subjects will be randomized to one of four sequences. All subjects will receive oral or intravenous (IV) midazolam on Days 1, 3, 9 and 11 as per assigned randomization scheme. Starting on Day 4 through Day 11, subjects will receive a daily dose of 1500 milligrams (mg) of oral lapatinib.
In Part 2, which will begin on Day 12, the subjects will be required to take 1500 mg of lapatinib daily until removed from the study for disease progression, adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or transfer to another lapatinib study.</description>
