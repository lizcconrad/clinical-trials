  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blood and tissue study to determine the effect of the drug called denileukin
      diftitox on the immune system cells that may be involved in patient response to their
      cutaneous t-cell lymphoma.

      Patients who are undergoing standard of care therapy with denileukin diftitox will be invited
      to participate. Blood and tissue samples will be obtained at baseline, day 5 and day 19 in up
      to the first 4 cycles of denileukin diftitox.

    <textblock>
      Although the etiology of CTCL is not fully understood, it is believed to be a malignancy
      proliferation of a &quot;memory&quot; T-cell in the context of Th2-type cytokine profile and suppressed
      cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) immunity. T-regulatory (T-regs) cells may be important in CTCL in the
      setting of immunotherapy. Removal of T-regs would result in enhanced immune responses in
      vitro, which may translate into augmentation of the anti-tumor immune response and durable
      clinical responses in vivo. We propose to evaluate effects of ONTAK on the T-reg cell subset
      in patients undergoing routine therapy with ONTAK. We will evaluate T-reg subsets in
      peripheral blood and tumor tissues from the patients both phenotypically using multi-color
      FACS analysis and confocal microscopy, and functionally in MLRs and ELISpot assays with
      baseline, day 5 and 19 blood samples in up to four cycles.
