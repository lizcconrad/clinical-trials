  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a progressive disease that decreases the pumping action of the heart. This
      may cause a backup of fluid in the heart and may result in heart beat changes. Using a
      medical device like a pacemaker or a defibrillator can help the heart to pump in regular
      beats. However, not all patients do better with a device. Currently, there is not a way to
      identify which patients will benefit from the device. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if using medical tests, Echocardiogram, can help in predicting which patients will
      improve. The types of patients needed for this study are those who have been diagnosed with
      moderate or severe heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe heart failure

               -  Ejection Fraction ( measurement of blood pumped out of the heart) less than 35%

               -  Wide (greater than 130 milliseconds) QRS duration for US patients only.

               -  May include patients with less than 130 millisecond QRS duration if they have
                  mechanical dyssynochrony (uncoordinated heart contractions) in Europe.

               -  All patients enrolled should be stable on medications that include at least an
                  ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) and at optimal level for at
                  least one month prior to surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that are not eligible for this study are those that have a mechanical right
             heart valve or are experiencing the following medical conditions within the last 3
             months:

               -  Chest pain / unstable angina

               -  Acute heart attack

               -  Chronic or permanent atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation

               -  Contrary artery bypass graft (CABG)

               -  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)

               -  Patients who have had intermittent or continuous Inotropic drug therapy are not
                  eligible for this study.

               -  Patients who have had heart transplant or a prior Cardiac Resynchronization
                  Therapy device are not eligible for this study.

               -  Patients who are pregnant or are of child-bearing potential are not on a form of
                  birth control may not participate in this study.
