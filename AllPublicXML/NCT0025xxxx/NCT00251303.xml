      This study will examine the effectiveness of riluzole for treating Obsessive-Compulsive
      Disorder in Youth, Including those with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by the
      presence of intrusive and unwanted obsessional thoughts and images and of compulsive
      behaviors. Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except
      that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors.
      Although many patients benefit from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs), a significant proportion have limited or no response to these medications. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be effective for OCD, alone or in combination with SSRIs,
      but there is a shortage of qualified therapists, and many patients and families cannot
      participate effectively in the therapy.

      There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for
      pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from
      dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role
      in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and may be involved in the
      etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may
      provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic
      activity. A small open-label trial suggested that it might reduce OCD severity among children
      and adolescents.

      The investigation will enroll up to 80 pediatric subjects with OCD including some who have
      both autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCD. The subjects will participate in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial of riluzole as a sole agent or as an
      augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy. Following the double-blind portion of the
      trial, subjects may receive three months of open-label treatment with riluzole, if it is
      clinically indicated. All subjects will be followed at regular intervals until one year from
      baseline.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 7 to 17 years of age.

          2. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted
             means of contraception or must remain abstinent.

          3. Each legal guardian must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all
             required tests and examinations. Each legal guardian must understand the nature of the
             study. Each legal guardian must consent to study protocol.

          4. Subjects must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for (OCD) and have a CY-BOCS score of greater
             than 20. In the double-blind phase, subjects enrolled in the combined OCD and ASD
             cohort must also meet DSM-IV criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder as well as
             OCD.

          5. Each subject already taking medicine must be taking usually effective doses of a
             medicine demonstrated to be effective in childhood OCD, must have been stable on that
             dose for at least six weeks, and must have no newly recognized or intolerable adverse
             effects from that medicine. Subjects who are currently not taking such a medication
             must have had adequate trial in the past of at least one medicine that has been shown
             to be effective for the symptoms of childhood OCD, and must have failed to see
             improvement or must have had intolerable adverse effects from the medicine.

          6. Subjects must be able to swallow capsules.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. Presence of psychotic symptoms or lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
             other psychotic disorder, or other serious unstable psychiatric illness. Medically
             unstable due to binging, purging, or starvation.

          2. Judged clinically to be at risk for suicide (suicidal ideation, severe depression, or
             other factors). Diagnosis of DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder is not necessarily an
             exclusion criterion.

          3. Disabling Tic Disorder requiring contraindicated medicines.

          4. Male or female subjects who are unwilling to use effective contraception, or female
             subjects who are pregnant or nursing.

          5. Serious unstable illnesses, including gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular
             (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or
             hematologic disease.

          6. Renal or hepatic dysfunction that would interfere with excretion or metabolism of
             riluzole as evidenced by increase above upper limits of normal for BUN/creatinine, or
             more than two-fold elevation above upper limits of normal of serum transaminases
             (ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT), gamma glutamate (GGT), or bilirubin.

          7. Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to riluzole.

          8. DSM-IV Substance Abuse Disorder within the past 90 days or Substance Dependence
             Disorder within the past 5 years, or any use of tobacco.

          9. Taking contraindicated drugs.

         10. Unable to swallow capsules.

         11. In addition, patients will not receive cognitive-behavior therapy during the period of
             the study.

         12. Abnormal EEG unless evaluated by a neurologist and approved by that specialist for
             this protocol.

          <description>In a 12-weeks long double-blind phase, the clinicians and subjects and their guardians were blind to active drug or placebo. There were approx. twice monthly in-person or telephone contacts.
Riluzole was titrated upward to at least 100 mg of active drug. If adverse effects are noted, dose titration was slowed, stopped, or reversed, or the drug was discontinued. Maximum permitted dose of riluzole was 120 mg/day. At the end of the 12 weeks study period, subjects and their families could elect to take open-label riluzole.Since neither subjects nor investigators knew whether subjects had been receiving active drug,the open-label administration was also titrated. Laboratory assays were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting the open-label riluzole, as they had been during double-blind. Subsequently, testing was less frequent.</description>

            <description>In a 12-weeks long double-blind phase, the clinicians and subjects and their guardians were blind to active drug or placebo. There were approx. twice monthly in-person or telephone contacts.
Riluzole was titrated upward to at least 100 mg of active drug. If adverse effects are noted, dose titration was slowed, stopped, or reversed, or the drug was discontinued. Maximum permitted dose of riluzole was 120 mg/day. At the end of the 12 weeks study period, subjects and their families could elect to take open-label riluzole.Since neither subjects nor investigators knew whether subjects had been receiving active drug,the open-label administration was also titrated. Laboratory assays were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting the open-label riluzole, as they had been during double-blind. Subsequently, testing was less frequent.</description>

Study blind was not broken for subjects or investigators until the final subject had completed the double-blind phase of the study.</description>
