  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic writing about one's emotions has been described previously (J Pennebaker:
      Emotions, disclosure and health. Am Psychol. Assoc 1995). The present project will compare
      the effects (if any) of writing about the emotional versus the physical consequences of lung
      disease on anxiety, perceived quality of life, and perceived health status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (age 35-70) and asthma patients (age
      20-60) referred to a 4 weeks inpatient rehabilitation program - who agree to participate in
      the project - are randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

        -  Writing about emotional consequences of their disease before the program starts

        -  Writing about physical consequences of their disease before the program starts

        -  Not writing

      All patients are measured (completing questionnaires at home) on: perceived quality of life,
      perceived health status and trait anxiety - 2 weeks before the program, 2 weeks after the
      program and 6 months after the program. FEV1 and 6 min walking distance are measured at the
      beginning and by the end of the program.

      In addition to questionnaires, all patients are asked to:

        -  Write in their own words ( 2 weeks after) to evaluate their stay at the rehabilitation
           clinic; and

        -  Write in their own words (6 months after) about how the disease affects their life at
           that point.

      Both quantitative and qualitative data will be used for analysis purposes.
