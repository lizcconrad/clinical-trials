      The purpose of this study is to determine if this combination is safe and effective in this
      situation especially to increase the rate of pathological complete response (PCR). Women with
      large tumors and or lymph node involvement at the time of initial diagnosis may benefit from
      receiving chemotherapy prior to surgery to shrink the tumor and to decrease the amount of
      tumor involvement before surgery. If chemotherapy given before breast surgery is effective in
      decreasing the size of the tumor, breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) may be possible.
      This new combination may be better tolerated than other commonly used regimens and, to date,
      appears to be at least as effective.

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant (primary) chemotherapy is being used more frequently in locally advanced breast
      cancer in an effort to reduce the size of the primary tumor prior to surgery and to eliminate
      micrometastatic disease.Through previous studies, it has been shown that patients who receive
      neoadjuvant therapy demonstrate prolonged disease-free survival when compared to those who
      did not have a pCR at the time of surgery.

      It is proven that docetaxel is the single most active drug in metastatic breast cancer
      treatment and therefore has sparked interest in its use in the neoadjuvant setting. There
      have been studies conducted using docetaxel either alone or in combination in this setting
      and in one particular study showed that patients treated with docetaxel after an
      anthracycline –containing regimen achieved at 34% pCR compared to only 16% with the
      anthracycline-containing regimen alone. This drugs low incidence of neutropenia when
      administered on a weekly schedule, plus its possible synergistic effects with carboplatin and
      capecitabine lead to its inclusion in this neoadjuvant protocol.

      Carboplatin is an agent that has recently been integrated into the front line of breast
      cancer treatment due to its response rate and tolerability. This drug as well has warranted
      further investigation in the neoadjuvant setting and was combined with docetaxel in one trial
      for for locally advanced disease which showed a preliminary pCR of the breast and axilla of
      30% and 80% respectively. Due to its tolerability, minimal toxicities, and impressive results
      as a single agent and in combination with docetaxel made carboplatin a reasonable drug of
      choice in this study.

      The novel oral agent capecitabine is being used in this protocol because it has shown through
      study to significantly increase response rate, time to progression, and even overall survival
      when combined with docetaxel in the metastatic setting. As well, capecitabine behaves
      similarly to continuous 5-FU infusion which has shown success in several phase II neoadjuvant
      trials and essentially has led to its inclusion in this study. Capecitabine’s anti-tumor
      activity, coupled with ease of administration, potential synergism with docetaxel and
      carboplatin, and non-overlapping toxicities justifies its inclusion in this investigational
      regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women or men &gt; 18 years old with histologically confirmed, by needle core biopsy (not
             FNA), locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  All patients must have either T2 lesion which is felt to be initially resectable only
             through mastectomy by the surgeon, or with a T3 N0-N2; T4 any N; or any T with N2 or
             N3 clinical evidence of disease. Stage 2 patients where breast conservation surgery is
             desired but impractical at diagnosis because of anticipated poor cosmetic outcome are
             eligible. Patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma and women with ipsilateral
             supraclavicular node involvement are eligible. Patients must have measurable disease
             defined as a breast lesion &gt; 2 cm or with fixed or marked ipsilateral axillary nodes
             and/or ipsilateral internal mammary nodes.

          -  Pre-and Post-menopausal female and male patients are eligible. Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test and, men and women must be willing to
             consent to using effective dual methods of contraception while on treatment and for
             three months thereafter.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          -  Bone scan and CAT scan of chest and abdomen negative for metastatic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic disease.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection other than mild resolving cellulitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure

             coronary artery disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Cancer other than breast primary within the last 5 years with the exception of
             surgically cured non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix.
