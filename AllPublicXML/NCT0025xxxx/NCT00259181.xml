  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), as an anti plaque agent, is commonly used with a variety of
      products. In this study we, the investigators at Hadassah Medical Organization, intend to
      examine the efficacy of a single dip in CHX of provisional restoration prior to oral
      cementation. If the protocol is effective, we intend to calibrate it and recommend clinical
      use of the protocol. The examination of biofilm formation will be both with electron
      microscope and confocal scanning laser microscope.
