      1.1 To determine the regulation of topoisomerase I and II following alternating prolonged
      exposure to topotecan and etoposide (VP-16)

      1.2 To determine the time to progression and the objective response rate of this treatment in
      patients with incurable ovarian cancer.

      The rationale to study the downregulation of topoisomerase enzyme in ovarian cancer in
      relationship to the cell cycle distribution of the cancer cells after a prolonged continuous
      exposure to topo I and II poisons is to better understand the relationship between cell cycle
      and topo poisoning, which may lead to better clinical trial designs.

    <description>Course 1A: On day 1 treatment will start with a continuous infusion of TPT at 0.4 mg/m2/day for 21 days. A pump will be used to deliver the TPT. The bag in the pump will be replaced every week for sterility precautions.
Course 1B: On day 28, if ANC is &gt;1,500 and platelets &gt; 100,000, VP-16 will be administered orally at 50 mg/day for 14 days.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients, 18 years of age or older, with incurable ovarian advanced cancer are
             eligible provided that they have measurable disease by CT-scan imaging, or evaluable
             disease by tumor markers, following the criteria described by Rustin et al. (14).
             (Response to a specific treatment has occurred if after two CA-125 samples there has
             been a 50% decrease, confirmed by a fourth sample (50% response), or a serial decrease
             over three samples of greater than 75% (75% response). The final sample has to be at
             least 28 days after the previous sample.)

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent.

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500 or cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 and absence
             of a regular red blood cell transfusion requirement.

          -  Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and
             SGOT or SGPT &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as
             defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child
             bearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this
             trial.

          -  Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or
             cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.
