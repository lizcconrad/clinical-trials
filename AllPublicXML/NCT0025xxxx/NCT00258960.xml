    <textblock>
      Eligible patients must receive Caelyx plus Cyclophosphamide plus Herceptin for 6 cycles that
      will be administered every 4 weeks.

      Sample size calculation will be done by means of Simon's method in 2 stages for phase II
      studies and will be based on the principal aim of the study (evaluation of the rate of
      objective response).

      The hypothesis brings over of the efficiency of the treatment it will be accepted if a rate
      of objective response of at least 55 % is obtained, rejecting the efficiency of the treatment
      when the rate of response targets be lower than 35 %. In this case, considering an alpha
      error of 0.05 and 80 % power, 14 patients will be included in the first stage; the study
      would continue if more than 5 objective responses were found. The total number of patients to
      including in the study would be 44. The results will be significant if they find at least 20
      objective responses.

      Assuming a drop-out rate of 10 %, the total number of patients needed is 49 patients.
