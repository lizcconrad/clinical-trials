      Adopting and Demonstrating the Adaptation of Prevention Techniques (ADAPT) is a supplement to
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Based Organization Program
      Announcement 04064 (PA 04064). The purpose of ADAPT is to improve the understanding of the
      processes needed for adapting evidence-based behavioral interventions to fit new conditions
      or populations and to pilot the CDC-developed adaptation guidance. The ADAPT project responds
      to concerns from the field that existing interventions do not address the HIV prevention
      needs of their specific population. This project seeks to develop guidance for agencies to
      engage in the evidence-based adaptation of interventions previously shown to be effective in
      evaluation settings for use in real world applications.

      The New Orleans AIDS Task Force (NO/AIDS) is one of five grantees funded to use the
      adaptation guidance to adapt an intervention packaged by the CDC's Replicating Effective
      Programs and disseminated by CDC's Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions. The
      agency will adapt Jeff Kelly's Popular Opinion Leader (POL) intervention (Kelly, 2004; Kelly
      et al., 1991) for use in Internet venues with seropositive men who identify
      ethnically/racially as other than White/Caucasian who have sex with other men (men who have
      sex with men [MSM] of color).

      Kelly's POL intervention is a community-level, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention
      that originally targeted gay and bisexual men in smaller cities throughout the United States.
      Kelly's intervention seeks to identify and enlist the support of well-known and well-liked
      opinion leaders to take on risk reduction advocacy roles. Opinion leaders attend sessions to
      learn how to engage in risk reduction conversations with people in their own social networks.
      The opinion leaders help to reshape social norms to encourage safer sex by helping to create
      a social environment in which MSM feel comfortable and empowered to make decisions to avoid
      high-risk sexual behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2000, NO/AIDS was funded by the CDC to conduct community mobilization. Two components of
      that program were Kelly's POL and outreach in Internet chat rooms. Kelly's POL targeted
      traditional venues frequented by MSM, such as gay bars. Online outreach in chat rooms was
      modeled after standard street outreach, where outreach workers provide HIV/AIDS, sexually
      transmitted disease and risk reduction information and referrals. Since the agency started
      online outreach, the Internet has continued to grow and it has become a mainstream venue for
      MSM to seek sexual partners online while maintaining their anonymity (Benotsch et al., 2002;
      Bull et al., 2001). With this trend, the agency realized that the online MSM community needed
      to be targeted by multiple behavior change interventions comparable to those implemented in
      other at risk venues. The agency included implementation of Kelly's POL online in chat rooms
      frequented by MSM as one of the interventions to be funded through the CDC's PA 04064 (the
      parent grant). As of August 2004, the agency has been funded under the parent grant to
      conduct Kelly's POL online in chat rooms that serve New Orleans, Louisiana, and the
      Southeastern U.S. region. This parent grant project shall be referred to as South POL.
      Supplemental PA 04064 funding for ADAPT will be used to further adapt South POL to target
      seropositive MSM of color. The supplement grant project shall be referred to as South POL+.

      The South POL+ intervention has three main goals: first, to adapt the intervention for use
      with adult seropositive MSM of color based on formative evaluation findings; second, to
      evaluate and monitor the process of adapting the intervention utilizing the CDC-developed
      Adaptation Guidance; and third, to conduct implementation monitoring and evaluation and
      evaluation of the implementation of the adapted intervention.
