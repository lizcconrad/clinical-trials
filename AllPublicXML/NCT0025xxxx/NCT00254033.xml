  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy, or lack of motivation, affects up to 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These
      amotivational symptoms increase patient reliance on caregivers, increase caregiver burden and
      distress, and increase the risk of patient institutionalization. Only 50% of patients with
      apathy respond to current treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. The mechanism of apathy
      in AD is unknown hampering rational treatment. Our proposed pilot study will provide initial
      data required to develop an amphetamine challenge paradigm to probe the brain reward system.
      These results will be used to develop a larger study evaluating the role of the brain reward
      system in apathy in AD and link this information with pharmacologic treatment. AD is a
      complex neurobiological illness that needs to be understood at several levels to optimize
      treatment. At a neurochemical level, one has to identify the neurotransmitter abnormalities
      that accompany the clinical symptoms. The neurochemical level of analysis provides the link
      between pathology and symptoms and, for now, is the only avenue for biological therapies.
      Next, one has to translate knowledge of neurochemical abnormalities to practical treatments
      for the symptoms of AD. This pilot will allow us to develop a study that can address both of
      these goals. Furthermore, the larger study will further define the emerging concept of apathy
      as a syndrome and has broader implications for apathy in many other neuropsychiatric
      diseases.
