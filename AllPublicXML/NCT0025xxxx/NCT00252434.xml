      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a specially developed group counseling
      approach is better able to help HIV-positive gay and bisexual men (GBM) who use crystal meth
      to stop using methamphetamines, reduce sexual risk behaviors, and stay on their HIV
      medications than a standard drug treatment program. Another purpose is to determine whether
      having a drug abuse treatment program in an HIV medical clinic makes it easier to attend
      treatment than going to a separate location for drug abuse treatment.

      The study features activities that include development and refinement of a
      culturally-specific cognitive behavioral therapy that integrates aspects of drug abuse
      treatment with HIV medication adherence interventions and cultural elements of being a gay or
      bisexual man receiving medical care for HIV/AIDS. To estimate the size of the signal of this
      intervention, the study proposes a two parallel group design in which 50 treatment-seeking
      HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men who meet criteria for methamphetamine abuse and who
      receive HIV medical care at the UCLA Center for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE)
      clinic are randomized to the study condition or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.
      Participants assigned to the experimental condition receive 12 weeks of twice-weekly GCBT,
      with a 6-months post-randomization follow-up visit. Participants assigned to the TAU
      condition are referred to the UCLA Addiction Medicine Clinic (AMC), where they receive the
      clinic's standard of care treatment for methamphetamine dependence for 12 weeks, and return
      for a 6-month follow-up visit. Analyses are conducted on all participants who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, express desire for treatment, and receive at least one &quot;dose&quot;
      of the cognitive-behavioral treatment or make one visit to the AMC. Participants in both
      conditions agree to weekly and monthly data collection visits, including the provision of
      urine samples. Primary outcome variables are methamphetamine use, sexual risk behaviors, and
      HIV medication compliance. The proposed design maintains the focus on intervention
      development and feasibility, while recognizing that the second phase of this development will
      be informed by having accurate estimates of effect sizes for the intervention and adequate
      resources to conduct the full-scale trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-seropositive, GBM receiving medical treatment for HIV for at least 30 days prior
             to signing informed consent at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center
             for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE) clinic, aged 18-65

          2. Willing to give informed consent and comply with study procedures

          3. Willing to provide consent to contact treating physicians and pharmacies to assess
             adherence to HIV medications

          4. Diagnosed with current methamphetamine abuse as determined by Mini-International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)

          5. Interested in seeking treatment for methamphetamine abuse and in participating in this
             research project.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling to give, or withdrawal of, informed consent

          2. Inability to understand nature of study

          3. A psychiatric condition that, in the principal investigator's judgment, warrants
             additional intervention to ensure participant safety (e.g., meets Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]
             criteria for current bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder)

          4. Current suicidal ideation or suicide attempt within the past 3 months

          5. Concurrent dependence on opiates, alcohol, or benzodiazepines as determined by MINI.

          6. Total lack of any type of healthcare coverage. These potential participants will be
             given low-fee treatment referrals.
