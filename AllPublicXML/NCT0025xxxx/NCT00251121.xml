  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients complaining of tachycardia but with a negative Holter ECG, are for a limited time
      period offered a simplified electrophysiological(EP) examination. By a full
      electrophysiological study(EP study)electrodes are introduced for pacing and sensing i all
      four heart chambers. Where as by the mini invasive EP study only one electrode is introduced
      to the right atrium. The simplified procedure represent a smaller risk of complications,
      requires less resources but should yield the same diagnoses in more than 90% of the cases.
      The study is a feasibility study to see if the procedure can discover arrythmias in a fairly
      unselected patient population.

      Sykehuset Telemark performs every year approximately 800 Holter ECG examinations.
      Approximately 200 of these are on the indications tachycardia, and in about 170 patients the
      examination does not discover any tachycardia Patients who were examined in the period from
      August 1. 2004 to November 1. 2005 with a negative Holter are mailed a letter with
      information of the min invasive electrophysiological examination, and an offer of volunteer
      participation. Patients given their informed consent are then according to waiting list
      called for the mini-invasive EP-study.

      The protocol of the EP stimulation consists of: determination of pacing threshold, pacing
      with 8 asynchronous beats 600ms and an extrasystole with decremental intervals from 550 ms to
      200 ms. The seri is repeated with pacing on 400ms and with two extrasystoles as well as with
      isoprenaline stimulation.

    <description>A simple electrophysiologic examination uncovered reentry tachycardia in nine patients and paroxystic atrial flutter in three patients. A total of 56 electrophysiologic examinations were performed, uncovering 12 cases of tachycardia suitable for ablation. Two patients had to undergo DC-conversion, no other complication was observed.
Interpretation. A simplified electrophysiologic examination of this group of patients will uncover tachycardia suitable for ablation in approximately 20 % of the patients, and increase diagnostic yield of supraventricular tachycardia by 64 %.</description>
