    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common disorder and current treatments are unsatisfactory. Biofeedback may
      help patients with constipation and dyssynergic defecation, but its efficacy is unproven and
      whether this is due to behavioral modification or excessive attention is unknown. Methods: In
      a prospective randomized trial, the investigators investigated the efficacy of Biofeedback
      (manometric- assisted anal relaxation, muscle coordination and simulated defecation
      training), with either sham feedback therapy (Sham) or standard therapy (diet, exercise,
      laxatives; Standard) in 77 subjects (69 women) with dyssynergic defecation. Primary outcome
      measures included presence of dyssynergia, balloon expulsion time, number of complete
      spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM), and global bowel satisfaction. Data analyzed per
      protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:Patients were included if they fulfilled Rome II criteria for functional
        constipation, and during attempted defecation demonstrated a dyssynergic pattern of
        defecation, and either had prolonged difficulty with expelling a simulated stool (&gt; 1
        minute) or prolonged delay (&gt; 20% marker retention) in colonic transit.

        Exclusion Criteria: They were required to have no evidence of structural or metabolic
        diseases that could cause constipation, as assessed by colonoscopy/barium enema and routine
        hematological, biochemical and thyroid function tests. Patients taking drugs known to be
        constipating, for example opioids were either excluded or were asked to discontinue the
        drug prior to enrollment. Other exclusion criteria included: severe cardiac or renal
        disease, previous gastrointestinal, spinal or pelvic surgery except cholecystectomy,
        hysterectomy or appendectomy, neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke or
        spinal injury, impaired cognizance (mini-mental score &lt; 15), legal blindness, pregnancy,
        rectal prolapse, anal fissure, and alternating constipation and diarrhea.
