      This study will look at the following questions:

        -  Was there a significant difference in HIV prevention knowledge, risk reduction
           attitudes, norms, intentions, self efficacy, number of sexual partners, and incidence of
           unprotected anal intercourse among seropositive Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM)
           after the implementation of ADAPT-POL?

      Hypothesis: There will be a significant increase in HIV prevention knowledge, intentions, and
      self efficacy concerning condom use. There will be a decrease in risk attitudes, norms,
      number of sexual partners, and incidence of unprotected anal intercourse among seropositive
      Hispanic MSM after the implementation of ADAPT-POL.

        -  How is exposure to the intervention and intervention dosage related to the following
           variables: HIV prevention knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors concerning
           unprotected anal intercourse?

      Hypothesis: Intervention exposure and dosage are positively correlated with improved HIV
      prevention knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors concerning unprotected anal
      intercourse.

      The proposed project, Adopting and Demonstrating the Adaptation of Prevention Techniques
      (ADAPT), has two main goals: first, to assist the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) to better understand the processes needed for adapting evidence-based behavioral
      interventions to fit new conditions or target populations; second, to utilize the CDC's draft
      adaptation guidance to adapt Jeff Kelly's Popular Opinion Leader (POL) for use with adult,
      seropositive Hispanic men who have sex with other men (MSM). The target population will
      directly participate in all phases of the intervention adaptation process.

      ADAPT, known as ADAPT-POL in El Paso, will include formative research and outcome monitoring.
      Throughout both periods, the ADAPT-POL staff will conduct process monitoring and evaluation
      to assess the delivery of the intervention, and to help the CDC understand how the draft
      adaptation guidance procedures work in a real world setting. Representatives of the target
      population will participate in focus groups, key informant interviews, and community advisor
      meetings during the formative phase; and potentially serve as popular opinion leaders (POLs)
      during the implementation phase.

      The knowledge obtained during the ADAPT-POL intervention will be diffused to other
      interventions and programs at the Planned Parenthood Center of El Paso (PPCEP). This will
      allow PPCEP management and staff to make informed decisions about the adoption of
      interventions and what steps might be necessary to adapt existing and future PPCEP
      interventions that target Hispanic populations. At the conclusion of ADAPT activities, the
      CDC-developed draft adaptation guidance will be revised based on lessons learned.

          -  Men who have sex with other men

          -  Sexual contact to orgasm with a man within past year

          -  Hispanic

          -  At least 18 years of age

             questionnaire respondents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MSM who are not willing to identify themselves to study staff as seropositive Hispanic
             MSM may be excluded.

          -  Those under 18 years of age will be excluded from participation due to the study
             design precluding direct applicability of hypotheses and intervention to both adults
             and children due to different cognitive development, HIV prevalence levels, and social
             networks.

          -  Serious mental illness which makes the individual unsuitable for participation

          -  Under the influence of drugs or alcohol which makes the individual unsuitable for
