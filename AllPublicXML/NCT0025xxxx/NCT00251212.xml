  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to address both alcohol misuse and violence among adolescents ages
      14-18 seeking care in an urban emergency department (ED). The study is a randomized
      controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of a combined Adapted Motivational Interviewing
      and Skills Training intervention, delivered either by a computer or by a counselor, and an
      informational handout control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will screen ~3000 adolescents in the ED (ages 14-18) over 30 months. Eligible
      adolescents will be asked to participate in the longitudinal study, stratified by age and
      gender and randomized to conditions (n=225/group): Computer Prevention Program, Counselor
      Prevention Program, or an informational handout control condition. Primary outcomes will be
      evaluated at 3, 6 and 12-months and include alcohol use/misuse, violent behaviors, illicit
      drug use, unintentional injury, delinquency, and weapon carriage. The proposed study
      integrates brief intervention strategies for alcohol misuse and violent behaviors using
      state-of-the-art technology to tailor the interventions to the specific risk factors of the
      adolescent. Tailored computerized programs use available technology to replace the need for
      clinical staff in the ED setting, where there is limited staff time to effect behavior
      change. This project will provide the critical first step toward the implementation of an
      integrated prevention program addressing overlapping risk factors that has the potential to
      be delivered to the millions of adolescents visiting urban Emergency Departments each year.
