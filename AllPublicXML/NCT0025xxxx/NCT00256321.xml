  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the second most common neoplasm in the world. Early diagnosis and surgical
      resection improve the survival and the chance of cure. Unfortunately, majority of cases are
      diagnosed at advanced stage, with only 20% of the patients presenting with localized disease.
      The five-year survival for gastric cancer of all stages remains at a dismal 8%. Chemotherapy
      has been used for advanced gastric cancer but with unsatisfactory results. Therefore, new
      approaches are needed for these patients. Among the newer chemotherapy regimens for advanced
      gastric cancer include a combination of oral 5FU-based compound called Capecitabine(Xeloda)
      and Oxaliplatin. A few phase II studies suggest that the combination regimen is active with
      overall response rates ranging 30-40%. Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown
      that the expression of cyclooxygenase enzyme II(COX-2) is upregulated in many pre-neoplastic
      and neoplastic lesions. Furthermore, there appears to be an association with the
      overexpression of Cox-2 and the invasiveness of cancer and prognosis. Finally, preclinical
      and clinical studies suggest selective Cox-2 inhibitors can induce apoptosis in gastric
      cancer cells and retard tumor progression. Therefore, there is a strong rationale for the
      combination of a selective Cox-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in a
      therapeutic phase II trial for patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have histologically proven, pathologically verified and surgically
             incurable(unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic) gastric/gastroesophageal junction
             carcinoma. Gastric lymphoma and Gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST) are ineligible
             for this study. At least 6 unstained paraffin-embedded pathologic specimen slides will
             be required for the COX-2 expression assays.

          -  Patient must have bidimensionally measurable disease as defined in Section 10.1a. All
             measurable lesions must be assessed (by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide
             scan or plain X-ray) within 30 days prior to registration. The patient's disease
             status must be completely assessed and reported.

          -  All patients must undergo a CT of abdomen and chest within 30 days prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients with brain metastases are NOT eligible for this study. It is not mandatory to
             obtain brain CT or MRI on all patients. However, patients who exhibit neurological
             symptoms or have pulmonary metastases on radiographic studies must obtain brain CT w/
             IV contrast or MRI prior to registration to ascertain the presence of brain
             metastasis.

          -  Patients must NOT have received capecitabine or oxaliplatin. Prior use of cisplatin,
             carboplatin, 5-FU are permitted. Prior systemic therapy must have been completed at
             least 30 days before registration.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy. Radiation therapy must have been
             completed at least 30 days before registration.

          -  Patients may have received prior surgery. Prior surgery must have been completed at
             least 30 days before registration.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod Performance Status of 0-2.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are not eligible to participate in this trial because the
             safe use of these drugs in pregnancy have not been established. Urine pregnancy test
             must be done prior to the study.

          -  Patient must NOT have known allergic reaction to sulfonamides

          -  Patient must NOT have known allergic or other adverse reaction to celecoxib

          -  Patient must NOT have persistent peripheral neuropathy

          -  Patient must NOT have known hypersensitivity reactions to 5-FU or platinum

          -  Patient must NOT have active gastric/duodenal bleeding

          -  Patient must NOT have had a sensitivity reaction to aspirin or other NSAIDS
             [experiencing asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or
             other NSAIDs]
