      Potential participants in the Lung Cancer Case Registry will be all patients diagnosed or
      evaluated for possible treatment of lung cancer at the Cancer Research and Treatment Center
      (CRTC) and New Mexico Veterans Health Care System (NMVHCS).

      Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US in both men and women. This
      research study will enroll lung cancer patients into a registry to study changes in DNA (or
      genetic material) that may be associated with development of lung cancer or other lung
      diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We will also study the role of
      eating habits on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as the effects of the disease
      and treatment on quality of patient's lives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants in the Lung Cancer Case Registry will be all patients diagnosed
             or evaluated for possible treatment of lung cancer at the CRTC and NMVHCS. Recruiting
             will primarily be performed through the Multidisciplinary Chest Clinics held weekly at
             each hospital. These clinics are staffed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and Reza
             Mehran, MD, a thoracic surgeon at both hospitals and a co-investigator on this
             submission. Approximately 90% of all lung cancer cases diagnosed at the NMVHCS, and a
             somewhat smaller proportion of cases treated in the Cancer Center, are seen in these
             clinics. Additional cases will be identified through review of new patient visits to
             each hospital with a diagnosis of lung cancer; Drs. Crowell and Mehran also maintain
             weekly contact with pathology and oncology services at both facilities, which will
             facilitate case identification at NMVHCS and University Hospital. Finally, patient
             contact records will be correlated with tumor registry records at both hospitals,
             which will identify any cases not captured through the above mechanisms. Although
             these cases may be identified several weeks after initial diagnosis, all attempts will
             still be made to contact the patient and family for enrollment into the registry. Most
             Spanish-speaking patients served by the CRTC and the NMVHCS are bilingual, and a
             language barrier has not been a problem in other similar studies conducted by the PI.
             However, Spanish-speaking personnel are available to obtain consent and answer any
             questions if necessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they cannot provide written informed consent.
