  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of cancer. The goal of
      this project is to establish a series of cross-sectional / case-control studies to evaluate
      risk factors of cancer in China.

      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical
      characterization of individuals with cancer (gastric, colorectal, esophageal, liver,
      prostate, lung, breast and endometrial cancer, etc.). We will accrue approximately 1600
      patients as experimental group. The control group consists of subjects who will be confirmed
      without cancer. We will explore the environmental (including family history, life style,
      diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress
      factors, angiogenic factors, and tumor markers, etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress
      factors and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We will study the association between
      various environmental risk factors with the clinical characterization and correlation between
      the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of various cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This is a study only of Chinese. Subjects will be allowed to participate if they
             self-identify as Chinese. The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 89
             years. Individuals with cancer (gastric, colorectal, esophageal, liver, prostate,
             lung, breast and endometrial cancer, etc.) will be allowed to participate. To
             participate in the study as the control, subjects should be confirmed without cancer.
