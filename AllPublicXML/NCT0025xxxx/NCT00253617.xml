      RATIONALE: Stent placement may help reduce symptoms caused by the tumor. Photodynamic therapy
      uses a drug, such as porfimer sodium, that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain
      kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. This may be an effective
      treatment for cholangiocarcinoma. It is not yet known whether stent placement and
      photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium are more effective than stent placement alone in
      treating cholangiocarcinoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying stent placement and photodynamic therapy
      using porfimer sodium to see how well they work compared to stent placement alone as
      palliative treatment in treating patients with stage III or stage IV cholangiocarcinoma that
      cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival time in patients with unresectable Bismuth type III or IV,
           stage III-IV cholangiocarcinoma treated with double plastic endoprostheses insertion
           with vs without adjuvant photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium as palliative
           treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on cholestasis in these patients.

        -  Compare the 1-year survival rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare health-related quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center.

      Patients undergo endoscopic or percutaneous drainage followed by insertion of bilateral
      plastic endoprostheses into the bile ducts. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive porfimer sodium IV on day 1. Patients undergo endoscopic laser
           light therapy to the tumor site on day 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. Quality of life is assessed at baseline
           and then at weeks 2, 13, 26, 39, 52, and 65.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 30-90 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
