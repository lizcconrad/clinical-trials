  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco Smoking is the most prevalent addiction in society today causing directly major
      health hazards and sharing morbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Nicotine binds to
      acetylcholine receptors and thus elevates DA release and inhibits DA transport. There are few
      studies using advanced brain imaging techniques to investigate how nicotine releases dopamine
      in humans. These studies utilized dopamine displacement paradigms with [11C] Raclopride
      binding to D2 receptor in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). There is evidence that smokers
      (particularly those who enjoyed smoking) showed decreased [11C] Raclopride binding in the
      caudate/nucleus accumbens and putamen after smoking cigarettes. These results also indicated
      that the effects of nicotine on dopaminergic neurotransmission are mediated by pleasure and
      craving. We propose to investigate the effects of smoking a cigarette ad lib on dopamine
      release by using dopamine competition paradigm with [I123] IBZM in SPECT. Secondly, we will
      test the hypothesis that dopamine deficiency is a major vulnerability factor for smoking.
      This may provide further evidence that dopamine deficiency in some smokers pre-disposes them
      to enjoy and desire smoking cigarettes more than others.
