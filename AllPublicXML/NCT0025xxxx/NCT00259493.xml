  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare graft patency rates following coronary artery bypass
      graft surgery performed by beating heart vs. conventional techniques using cardiac CT
      scanning to evaluate the bypass grafts.

      The issue of whether to perform conventional CABG or off-pump CABG continues to be the
      subject of debate. Controversy remains regarding the appropriateness of applying OPCAB to all
      patients as opposed to selected sub-populations.

      The main strategy of CABG is to obtain complete revascularization with the least morbidity
      and highest long-term patency rates. Current medical literature is conflicted regarding graft
      patency rates in OPCAB vs. conventional CABG. Data is also limited due to patient refusal for
      conventional angiography to assess grafts following surgery. Cardiac computed tomography (CT)
      offers a non-invasive method to assess graft patency that is 100% accurate for the diagnosis
      of graft patency vs. occlusion. This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial
      evaluating graft patency in on-pump vs. off-pump CABG using cardiac CT scanning. The study
      hypothesis is that graft patency rates will be equivalent between the two techniques.
