  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of an immune response to an
      investigational HIV vaccine, ADMVA, at three different dosage levels, in adults who are not
      infected with HIV
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation trial. Study site staff and volunteers will be blinded. Blinding
      will not apply to the assignment of dose levels (low, middle or high).

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before enrolment and will be followed for 18 months
      after the first vaccination.

      16 volunteers will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio of active vaccine to placebo. Safety and
      tolerability of the ADMVA vaccine/placebo will be evaluated at least 14 days after the 12th
      volunteer in the low dose group receives the second injection before proceeding to the middle
      dose group.
