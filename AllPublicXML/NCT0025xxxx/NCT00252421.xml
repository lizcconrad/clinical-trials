    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis or &quot;thinning of the bones&quot; affects in 1 in 4 Canadian women and 1 in 8 Canadian
      men. Moreover, while the rates of osteoporosis among Canadians are stabilizing, worldwide the
      number of people afflicted with osteoporosis continues to rise. The most serious complication
      of osteoporosis is a broken bone or fracture. Fractures due to osteoporosis can result in
      long hospital stays, dependence on others, and premature death. While there are several
      medications that prevent osteoporosis they all have side effects. For example, postmenopausal
      women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are at increased risk of breast cancer and
      heart disease. In addition, drugs to prevent osteoporosis are expensive and not available
      worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that researchers continue to identify and test new
      medications for the prevention of osteoporosis.

      The purpose of the research is to determine if nitrates, a group of drugs that are widely
      available, inexpensive, and commonly used to treat chest pain or angina, can prevent
      osteoporosis in women. If the researchers find that nitrates prevent osteoporosis, a widely
      available, inexpensive treatment for osteoporosis prevention that does not have any long term
      side effects would have been identified. This will improve the health of patients with
      osteoporosis worldwide.

      This proposal consists of two studies. The objective of the first study is to determine which
      of isosorbide mononitrate (ISMO) at 20 mg/day or nitroglycerin ointment (NTG) at 15 mg/day
      results in fewer headaches. The nitrate that is best tolerated will be used in a second study
      with one main objective: To determine if postmenopausal women with a T-score at the lumbar
      spine (L1 to L4) between 0 and -2.0 randomized to two years of treatment with intermittent
      nitrates have a greater increase in spine BMD as compared to women randomized to placebo.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Women will report fewer headaches when they are randomized to intermittent NTG ointment
           at 15 mg/day compared to intermittent oral ISMO at 20 mg/day.

        2. After two years, women randomized to intermittent nitrates will have a greater percent
           increase in lumbar spine BMD compared with women randomized to placebo.

      To test these hypotheses we will execute 2 trials both of which include postmenopausal women,
      aged 50 and older, with BMD T scores at the lumbar spine between 0 and -2.0. We will exclude
      subjects with prior osteoporotic fractures or OP by BMD testing, subjects with current
      metabolic bone or cardiovascular disease, subjects taking treatments for OP, subjects with
      migraine headaches, and subjects with known hypersensitivity to nitrates. We will use
      computer generated randomization to allocate subjects to treatment assignments. To avoid bias
      the studies will be double-blind. The first study, which uses a crossover design, will
      recruit 22 subjects who will be randomly assigned to each of NTG ointment and ISMO for one
      week. In between treatments there will be a two week wash out period. Subjects will rate
      headaches on a daily basis using a visual analog scale and for each subject I will calculate
      the mean headache score over the 7 day treatment period for both treatments. We will then
      calculate the mean headache score (considering all subjects) for NTG and the mean headache
      score for ISMO. We will compare the mean headache scores for both treatments and the nitrate
      preparation that is best tolerated (lowest mean score) will be used in a second placebo
      controlled study (the main study) whose primary objective is to assess the effects of
      intermittent nitrates on spine BMD (L1 to L4) in 280 postmenopausal women. To limit
      differential drop out due to headaches among subjects randomized to nitrates, the main trial
      will follow a run-in phase during which all subjects will receive nitrates for one week. Only
      those subjects who do not have headaches resulting in discontinuation of the study medication
      during the nitrate run-in phase will enter the main study.
