      In general, to determine the sensitivity of light transport to tissue from morphological
      features of clinical significance.

      Determine how specific structural features contribute to light scattering. Investigate light
      scattering differences in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells.

      Develop and implement quantitative and sensitive methods for measuring morphological
      properties.

      Clinical measurements.

    <description>During the colposcopy or LEEP (Loop Electrical Excision Procedure) procedure, or during pelvic exams before surgery after the doctor applies 3% acetic acid to the cervix, the doctor then positions the colposcope to take pictures of the patient's cervix. Digital pictures are taken of the patient's cervix under white light using a colposcopy imaging system. These pictures are annotated by the doctor during the appointment to mark the spectroscopy sites.</description>
