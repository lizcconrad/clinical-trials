  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if medicinal cannabis (marijuana) is safe and
      effective for treating pain in individuals with HIV-associated distal, sensory-predominant
      polyneuropathy (DSPN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy occurs in over 30% of patients with HIV infection, making it among the
      most common neurological complications of HIV infection. Nucleoside analogues such as ddI and
      d4T, key components of modern, potent, combination antiretroviral therapies (ART), are also
      neurotoxic and contribute to the frequent occurence of painful neuropathy. By using treatment
      with available non-narcotic analgesic and adjunctive pain medications, approximately half of
      patients with painful HIV neuropathy obtain sufficient pain control.

      On the first day each study week (active or placebo), participants will follow a specific
      titration procedure to achieve the optimal dose. This optimal dose will then be continued for
      the duration of the treatment week. Participants will undergo a 2-week washout period, after
      which they crossover to the other arm (active or placebo) and will again repeat the dose
      titration and dose maintenance procedures.

      Comparison: Active cannabis doses ranging from 2-8% THC will be compared to placebo for the
      reduction of neuropathic pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented HIV infection

          -  Meets clinical and electrodiagnostic criteria for HIV-associated DSPN at entry

          -  Daily pain for at least three consecutive months with an average daily pain magnitude
             score of at least 5 on the Descriptor Differential Scale

          -  Inadequate pain relief with prior treatment for painful HIV neuropathy using drugs
             from at least two different classes of pain-modifying agents (NSAIDS, low-potency
             opioids, high-potency opioids, sodium channel blockers, other adjunctive pain
             treatments)

          -  Age 21-65 years

          -  Stable use of opioid and non-opioid analgesic medications during the two weeks prior
             to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive urine toxicology screen for cannabinoids during the &quot;wash-in&quot; week prior to
             initiating study treatment

          -  Recent (i.e. during the month prior to study entry) history of marijuana use more than
             twice a week

          -  Active AIDS-defining opportunistic disease (a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic
             disease which is no longer active or progressing will not be grounds for exclusion)

          -  Diabetes mellitus, renal failure with uremia, alcohol abuse, previous spinal surgery,
             or other documented causes of neuropathy or neuropathic pain

          -  Pulmonary disease of sufficient severity to require the use of supplemental oxygen

          -  Asthma

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 weeks or an active, acute illness likely to interfere with
             completion of the study protocol
