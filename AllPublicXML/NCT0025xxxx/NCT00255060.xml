      To screen women who are high risk for breast cancer with breast MRI, mammogram and random
      periareolar fine needle aspiration.

      General Purpose: The purpose of our protocol is develop a comprehensive screening protocol
      for women at high risk for developing breast cancer in the hopes of detecting breast cancer
      or it's precursor lesions at the earliest possible stage and reducing breast cancer
      mortality.

      The following are our specific goals in this endeavor;

        1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in breast cancer detection in women at
           high risk compared to mammography

        2. To assess the ability of random periareolar fine needle aspiration to detect abnormal
           ductal cells and to correlate these results with MRI and mammogram findings

        3. To assess appropriate screening intervals for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and women with a
           &gt;10% risk of developing breast cancer in ten years The following aims will be outlined
           in detail under methodology.

        Inclusion Criteria:Subjects must be female, between the ages of 25 and 65, or ten years
        younger than the youngest breast cancer diagnosed in the family, or have no mutation
        identified but have a greater than 10% risk of developing breast cancer in ten years (based
        on the Claus Model).

        May have had previous breast or ovarian cancer, but must be at least one year out from
        treatment of a Stage 1 or early 2 cancer.
