      The broad goal of this proposal is to reduce outpatient prescribing errors in rural primary
      care practices. Although computerized technology is available for prescribing, it has not yet
      been implemented in most settings. Additionally, rural prescribers will likely be the last to
      have the means to adopt this technology. Due to the substantial morbidity and mortality in
      the United States caused by outpatient medication errors, there is an urgent need for
      low-cost solutions. This research plan will evaluate a modified paper prescription form that
      may be implemented in rural primary care settings cheaply and quickly with the goal of
      outpatient prescription error reduction.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To determine if a modified paper prescription form decreases overall prescribing errors
           compared to a standard paper prescription form

        2. To determine if a modified paper prescription form decreases omission errors compared to
           a standard paper prescription form

        3. To determine prescriber satisfaction with the modified prescription form

      Rural prescribers from four states will be randomly recruited to write prescriptions on
      standard and modified forms. Prescription duplicates of both types will be analyzed for
      errors. Prescriber satisfaction with the modified form will be evaluated using surveys and
      focus groups.

      Medication errors are a public health problem. Low-cost technology that is shown to reduce
      medication errors would benefit all rural patients who receive prescriptions.
