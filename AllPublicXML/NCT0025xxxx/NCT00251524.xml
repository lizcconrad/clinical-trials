    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced non-squamous
      NSCLC.

      Each cycle will be 21 days. Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles (~6 weeks) for response
      using RECIST criteria. Those patients achieving stable disease or better will continue
      therapy. Those patients experiencing progressive disease will be taken off study.

      Patients will receive 6 cycles of Eloxatin, Alimta, and Bevacizumab. After the 6 cycles,
      patients will receive Bevacizumab alone every 21 days until evidence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Note: Once patient has completed the 6 cycles of Eloxatin, Alimta, and Bevacizumab and is
      receiving single-agent Bevacizumab, assessment of response will be performed every 3 cycles
      (~every 9 weeks) using RECIST criteria.

             have signed an IRB-approved informed consent to participate in the trial.

          -  Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease based on RECIST criteria. Tumor

             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are
             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.

             (ULN).

             phosphatase &lt;3 x ULN. For patients with liver metastases, ALT, AST, and alkaline
             phosphatase levels can be &lt;5 x ULN.
