      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      epirubicin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epirubicin works in treating women who are
      undergoing surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the complete pathological and clinical response rate in women undergoing
           surgery for resectable stage I-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant
           dose-intensified epirubicin hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the predictive value of HER2 gene amplification and topoisomerase II-alpha
           gene amplification or deletion for disease progression and pathological and clinical
           complete response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate gene expression profiles with pathologic complete response, clinical complete
           response, less than complete response, and disease progression in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1 and pegfilgrastim
      subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Four weeks later, patients undergo partial
      mastectomy or simple mastectomy plus an axillary staging procedure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
