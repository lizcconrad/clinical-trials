  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol is purported to possess cancer preventive activity, especially for colon cancer,
      though its mechanisms of action are not well defined. Resveratrol is found in the skin of
      grapes and has anti-oxidative and pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cell lines in vitro. The
      main dietary sources of resveratrol are grapes, grape products, and red wine, and small
      amounts may be found in mulberries. A prior report and compelling preliminary data from our
      laboratory suggest that resveratrol modulates Wnt signaling, a signaling pathway which is
      activated in over 85% of colon cancers. In this proposal, studies were performed to define
      the actions of resveratrol on the Wnt signaling pathway in a clinical trial in which patients
      with colon cancer received treatment with Resveratrol, and correlative laboratory studies
      examined its effects directly on colon cancer and normal colonic mucosa. These studies
      provided data on the mechanisms of resveratrol action and provided a foundation for future
      prevention trials, correlative studies and therapeutic clinical research with this agent.

      Patients will be treated with a two-week course of resveratrol. The initiation of the
      treatment will be approximately 14 days before standard of care surgical resection of tumor.
      Resveratrol will be ingested as 20 mg pills or in the form of freeze-dried grape extract
      which is prepared by the California Table Grape Commission used under GMP guidelines for
      human consumption.

      The first two patients receiving resveratrol will be treated at a dose of 20 mg/day, the
      third and fourth patients at a dose of 80 mg/day, and the fifth and sixth patients with a
      dose of 160 mg/day. All patients receiving grape extract will receive 125 mg/day that will
      have to be mixed with one 8 oz glass of water. There will be no dose adjustments. If a
      patient has any side effects which are attributed to the resveratrol, it will be
      discontinued.
