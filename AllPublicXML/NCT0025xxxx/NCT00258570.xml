      The purposes of this study are:

        -  to determine if there are specific genetic traits that might explain why patients have
           developed pulmonary fibrosis;

        -  to determine if specific genetic traits account for differing patterns of inflammation
           and scar tissue that has formed in the patient's lungs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is one of a collection of severe lung diseases that lead to
      abnormal inflammation and scarring of the lungs. The accumulation of scar tissue in the lung
      destroys normal lung tissue and results in the symptoms associated with this disease. The
      cause of the disease is currently unknown. In this study, we are attempting to determine if
      there are specific genetic traits that might explain why patients have developed pulmonary
      fibrosis. We are also attempting to determine if specific genetic traits account for
      differing patterns of inflammation and scar tissue that has formed in the patient's lungs.
      The purpose of this research is to identify genes that control the processes of lung
      inflammation, lung scarring, and lung repair. As more information becomes available, we will
      also conduct studies of additional genes that are found to be involved in this disease
      process.
