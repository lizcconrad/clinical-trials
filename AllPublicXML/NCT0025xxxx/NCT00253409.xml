      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the
      tumor so that it can be removed. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor
      cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more
      effective with or without surgery and radiation therapy in treating mesothelioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying combination chemotherapy, surgery, and
      radiation therapy to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in
      treating patients with mesothelioma that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the feasibility of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with vs without surgery
           and adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with resectable malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study followed by a randomized, controlled study.

      Patients undergo 3 courses of a platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) combination
      chemotherapy regimen to be determined by the treatment center. Upon completion of combination
      chemotherapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms provided tumor is resectable
      and there is no disease progression.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo extra-pleural pneumonectomy followed by post-operative
           radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo follow-up only. Patients may receive additional standard
           therapy according to their treatment center.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-670 patients will be accrued for this study.
