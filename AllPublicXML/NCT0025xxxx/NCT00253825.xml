      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate relative efficacy of (1)modified
      constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) combined with eye patching, (2)mCIMT, and (3)
      traditional rehabilitation on motor, attentional, and activities of daily living functions in
      stroke patients with unilateral neglect (UN). UN represents a failure to respond or orient to
      stimuli presented contralateral to a brain lesion. Constraint-induced movement therapy is
      made up of a family of treatment that involve repeatedly practicing use of the affected limb
      and constraining use of the unaffected arm in the clinic and at home. mCIMT is an
      intervention based on modifications to conventional CIMT by distributing practice sessions to
      a longer period of time. mCIMT attempts to supplement the inadequacy of the current
      rehabilitation programs and to fit better into rehabilitation schedules. This technique has
      been suggested to be especially relevant for treatment of patients with UN.Half-field eye
      patching involves occlusion of the hemifield of both eyes (in the case of left UN, the right
      hemifields of both eyes). Patching the ipsilateral hemifield is believed to increase
      activation of the involved hemisphere, resulting in increased attention to the contralateral
      neglected side.

      Despite the promising relevance of mCIMT for rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia, it
      remains unclear whether mCIMT is effective for alleviating UN. A further issue that warrants
      investigation is the combined effects of mCIMT and eye patching. Both approaches involve the
      use of controlled sensory input that may lead to increased activation of the lesioned
      hemisphere. Integration of both approaches may be more efficacious than mCIMT without direct
      intervention for UN. This project is proposed to study the combined effects of both
      approaches. It is hypothesized that combining both approaches will be more effective than
      mCIMT, which is hypothesized to be superior to traditional rehabilitation involving the same
      amount of therapy time. To test the hypotheses, 60 patients with unilateral stroke and UN
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (i.e., mCIMT and
      eye patching, mCIMT, and traditional rehabilitation). Testing for UN will include the use of
      the line bisection test, cancellation tasks, and examination for extinction to double
      simultaneous stimulations.

      The outcome measures will include traditional motor function tests, kinematic analysis, a
      circle discrimination test, and daily life functional measures. Each eligible participant
      will be tested before and immediately after the assigned intervention and at three months and
      six months after the treatment. Each type of treatment will be three-week long. Multivariate
      analysis of covariance will be used to analyze the obtained data in order to test for the
      relative effects of the three treatments. Each participant will be tested for motivation for
      participating in treatment sessions using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale.
      It is hypothesized that patients with higher participation will improve more than those with
      lower participation.

      The uniqueness of this proposed project pertains to (1)modification of the CIMT protocol in a
      more feasible way; (2)concurrent use of mCIMT and eye patching for treating UN post stroke;
      and (3)use of kinematic analysis for detecting precise changes in motor behavior post
      intervention. Kinematic analysis is relevant for identifying trajectory control deficits that
      may accompany clinically “recovered” UN. Findings of this investigation will improve
      assessment and treatment for UN that is devastating to functional recovery from stroke.
