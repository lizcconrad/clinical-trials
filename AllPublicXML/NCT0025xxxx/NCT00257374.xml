      Background: Pedialyte and Gatorade are advocated for the treatment of dehydration in viral
      gastroenteritis, but there is limited evidence to support their use.

      Objective: To examine the efficacy, safety and palatability of Pedialyte, Gatorade, and a New
      Oral Rehydration Solution (NS).

      Design: Randomized double blind. Setting: Inpatient, community hospital.
      Patients/Interventions: 75 consecutive adult patients (m/f=44/33) admitted with viral
      gastroenteritis were randomized to receive Gatorade, Pedialyte or NS for 48 hours. A
      yogurt/rice diet was allowed ad libitum.

      Measurements: Stool and urine output, electrolytes, fluid intake, body weight, hematocrit and
      palatability of solutions.

      Limitations: Smaller sample size and higher drop out (20%).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were included if they had mild-to-moderate diarrhea, with mildly sunken eyes
             and a clinical assessment of dehydration of less than 5%, a serum sodium concentration
             between 130-150 mEq/L, adequate general health and nutrition, a BUN/creatinine ratio
             of &gt;20 and with a normal pulse rate for age and degree of fever and adequate skin
             turgor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they had hyperthermia (&gt;39.0ยบ C), serum sodium &gt;150 mEq/L or
             &lt;130 mEq/L, white cell count &gt;15,000, bloody diarrhea (dysentery), abnormal
             cardiovascular or renal function or an underlying metabolic or nutritional disorder
             and most importantly, if the clinical assessment of dehydration was &gt;7% that suggested
             a need for intravenous fluids.
