      Primary Objective:

        -  The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority in clinical
           efficacy at the test of cure (TOC) visit planned 5-7 days after treatment completion of
           levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (od) in comparison with piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/500
           mg every 8 hours in treating adult patients suffering from mild to moderate
           hospital-acquired pneumonia.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the bacteriological efficacy at the test of cure (TOC) visit

        -  To assess the clinical and bacteriological efficacy at the end of study (EOS) visit, 28
           to 32 days after treatment ends

        -  To assess the tolerability of both drugs
