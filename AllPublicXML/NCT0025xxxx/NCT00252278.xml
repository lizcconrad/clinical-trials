  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) very commonly
      experience difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep. Studies have shown that daytime
      sleepiness resulting from insufficient sleep can affect attention and learning. Therefore,
      treating insomnia in children with ADHD may not only improve sleep, but it could potentially
      improve ADHD symptoms as well.

      The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of atomoxetine on ADHD-related
      insomnia. Atomoxetine (StratteraÂ®) is a non-stimulant drug used to treat ADHD symptoms in
      both children and adults, and there is evidence that it may also have a positive effect on
      sleep in children with ADHD. During the study, participants will receive either atomoxetine
      or placebo for a period of four weeks. We expect that the effects of atomoxetine on sleep
      will differ from those of placebo, with atomoxetine having a greater effect on improving
      sleep difficulties.
