  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if chemotherapy (cisplatin, docetaxel)
      is safe to give to patients whose lung cancer will be surgically removed, and to learn if
      maintenance therapy with the biologic agent erlotinib, given after surgery, is safe. Another
      goal of this study is to look at changes that occur in epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) and how these changes are reflected in different cells in the body. The effect of this
      treatment on the participant's quality of life and survival, as well as its effect on
      different cells in the body, will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib (Tarcevaâ, OSI-774) is a drug that helps to block the activity of an enzyme that is
      believed to play an important role in cell growth. It is hoped that blocking these enzymes
      will slow tumor growth. Both cisplatin and docetaxel (Taxotereâ) are commonly used
      chemotherapy drugs. These drugs are designed to target and destroy cancer cells.

      If you are found to be eligible, you will begin receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and
      docetaxel. Cisplatin and docetaxel will be given by vein once every 3 weeks. Both will be
      given on the same day every 3 weeks. Docetaxel is given first over 1 hour. Cisplatin is given
      second over 30 minutes to 1 hour. You will receive three 3-week cycles of chemotherapy while
      on this study. Treatment with erlotinib will begin after you have had surgery to remove the
      lung cancer. You will take erlotinib by mouth every day for the remainder of your treatment
      on this study.

      While taking chemotherapy, you will have blood tests every 3 weeks to look at your blood
      counts. This is to ensure that your body has recovered from the chemotherapy enough to
      continue treatment. About 2 teaspoons of blood will be needed for each test. These samples
      will be used only for routine lab tests. You will be seen by a physician every 3 weeks. At
      these visits, you will have a physical exam and a chest x-ray. You may have a neurological
      exam if your doctor thinks it is necessary. This exam will look at whether you have any
      numbness, test your hearing and vision, and will include other standard evaluations. Your
      vital signs and weight will be monitored and you will be asked about certain side effects. If
      necessary, depending on your side effects, you may need to have more frequent visits to see
      your physician.

      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy (9 weeks), you will have a CT scan of the chest and abdominal
      area, and possibly a CT scan of the area where the disease may be coming back. These are done
      to check the status of the disease.

      Within 90 days after surgery, you will begin taking erlotinib. On Day 1 of erlotinib
      treatment, you will have a physical exam, a performance status evaluation (questions about
      your ability to perform everyday activities), a chest x-ray, and blood drawn (about 2
      teaspoons) for routine tests. These tests will be repeated at Month 2, Month 3, then every 3
      months after that.

      On Day 1 of erlotinib treatment and every 3 months after that, you will also have a CT scan
      of the chest and abdominal area, and possibly a CT scan of the area where the disease may be
      coming back.

      You may receive treatment in the study for up to 1 year (3 cycles of cisplatin/docetaxel and
      then daily erlotinib for up to 1 year) and will receive long-term follow-up (for 5 years
      total) with your physician to monitor your condition and disease status. Your doctor may
      decide to take you off this study if you experience significant side effects or your medical
      condition worsens. Follow-up visits will include a chest x-ray and CT scan every 3 months
      during Year 2 and then every 6 months until Year 5.

      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is approved by the FDA for treatment of non-small
      cell lung cancer. Its use in this study is experimental. Docetaxel and cisplatin are FDA
      approved and commercially available. A total of 50 patients will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
