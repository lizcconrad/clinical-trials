  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiation therapy is the preferred initial treatment option for distal
      rectal cancers. However, assessing tumor response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy
      remains a challenge to the colorectal surgeon, especially when determining if there is a
      complete response, observed in more than 10% of cases. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the use of the PET/CT in assessing distal rectal tumor response to preoperative
      chemoradiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with distal rectal adenocarcinoma will be submitted to an initial whole body PET/CT
      prior to the preoperative chemoradiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil and 5040 cGy. Six weeks
      and 12 weeks after the preoperative treatment is finished the PET/CT will be repeated. At 1
      and at 2 years after preoperative treatment is concluded another PET/CT will be performed.
      The colorectal surgeon evaluating the response to chemoradiation therapy will be blinded to
      the results of the PET/CT, as the radiologist will be blinded to the response assessment.
      PET/CT results will not be used to determine treatment strategy, unless metastatic disease or
      other disease is diagnosed. Patients with a complete clinical response at 8 weeks will be
      rigorously followed while patients with an incomplete clinical response at 8 weeks will be
      submitted to radical surgery. PET/CT results will be compared to current radiological studies
      and final pathological reports.
