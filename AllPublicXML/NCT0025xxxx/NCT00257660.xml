    <measure>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TWSTRS is comprised of three different components which are severity, disability &amp; pain. There is an ordinal scale for each component and the score range for each is the following: for severity from 0 (absence of severity) to 35 (max severity), for disability from 0 (no disability) to 30 (max disability) and for pain from 0 (no pain) to 20 (max pain). TWSTRS total score is the sum of the 3 component scores, with a range from 0 to a maximum of 85. The change in TWSTRS total score is the score at week 4 minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)</title>
        <description>TWSTRS is comprised of three different components which are severity, disability &amp; pain. There is an ordinal scale for each component and the score range for each is the following: for severity from 0 (absence of severity) to 35 (max severity), for disability from 0 (no disability) to 30 (max disability) and for pain from 0 (no pain) to 20 (max pain). TWSTRS total score is the sum of the 3 component scores, with a range from 0 to a maximum of 85. The change in TWSTRS total score is the score at week 4 minus the score at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the intention to treat population which consisted of 55 subjects receiving Dysport and 61 Placebo. There were 4 subjects for Dysport and 3 for placebo who were not assessed on TWSTRS score at Week 4. As there was no imputation of missing TWSTRS score values, these 7 subjects were not taken into account.</population>

        <title>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>TWSTRS is comprised of three different components which are severity, disability &amp; pain. There is an ordinal scale for each component and the score range for each is the following: for severity from 0 (absence of severity) to 35 (max severity), for disability from 0 (no disability) to 30 (max disability) and for pain from 0 (no pain) to 20 (max pain). TWSTRS total score is the sum of the 3 component scores, with a range from 0 to a maximum of 85. The change in TWSTRS total score is the score at week 4 minus the score at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the intention to treat population which consisted of 55 subjects receiving Dysport and 61 Placebo. There were 10 subjects for Dysport and 17 for placebo who were not assessed on TWSTRS score at Week 12. As there was no imputation of missing TWSTRS score values, these 27 subjects were not taken into account.</population>

        <description>SF-36 is a Quality of Life scale comprising eight individual domains. The QoL score for each domain is on a scale from 0 (worst health possible) to 100 (best health possible). SF-36 Mental Health Summary Score is derived from four individual domains (vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health).</description>
