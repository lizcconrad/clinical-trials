  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what changes in blood vessel contraction may occur as a
      result of a disease of the vessel that requires surgery. The study will examine the calcium
      channels present in the vessels being operated on, and the genes that may alter blood vessel
      function. Possible variation in these genes may change the kind of calcium channels present
      in blood vessels.

      The goal of this study is to learn more about how blood vessels function and the mechanism
      that causes them to contract. The study will investigate the natural history of diseased
      blood vessel tissue and the calcium channels in the muscle part of the blood vessel. The
      study will also examine how genetics influences cardiovascular disease and its causes and
      treatments.

      Patients scheduled for vascular surgery will be approached to participate in this study.
      During surgery, tissue fragments of diseased and marginal tissue will be obtained. A blood
      sample will be obtained at either the time of surgery or consent and genomic DNA will be
      extracted.
