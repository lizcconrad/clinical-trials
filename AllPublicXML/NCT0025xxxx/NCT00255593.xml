  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current strategies for the medical management of transplant patients are largely focused on
      the prevention and treatment of T-lymphocyte mediated processes. However there is an
      increasing evidence to suggest that B-lymphocytes have a role in the otherwise classic T-cell
      mediated rejection of transplants by there ability to act as antigen presenting cells and
      T-cell activators. Thus there is a significant medical need for effective therapies targeting
      B cells of transplant patients.One such potential therapy would be to use rituximab, a
      monoclonal antibody against B-cells in all renal transplant patients. In the present study
      the efficacy and safety of prophylactic rituximab is studied.
