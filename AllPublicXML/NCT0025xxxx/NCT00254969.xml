      The present clinical study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Aventis
      Pasteur's DTacP-IPV// PRP~T combined vaccine (Pentavac™ or Pentaxim™) as a three-dose primary
      vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age followed by a booster dose during the second year of
      life in order to meet the requirements for application for the use of the product in the
      Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in South Africa.
