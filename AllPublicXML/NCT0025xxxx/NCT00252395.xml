  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All reliably evaluated POE systems to date have been desktop computer based, but now there is
      widespread use and acceptance among physicians of PDA devices for a variety of purposes.
      Clinicians report that drug information on a PDA improved their access to information and
      efficiency while reducing their self perceived error rates6. The use of these devices for
      information retrieval in clinical settings is expected to grow as wireless communication
      becomes more ubiquitous and as more applications become available6,7. During the past decade
      there has been a growing awareness of several issues aimed at promoting safer health care for
      our patients â€“ point of care information technology is one of the keys.

      To this end we have worked with a Canadian company, Drugmagnet, to develop and implement
      PDA-based electronic prescribing system within a major Canadian academic health centre. This
      is a cluster randomised trial, in which access to and use of the e-prescribing system is
      switched on and off for randomly chosen weeks, thus time serves as the randomized element.
