  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma represents the second most common hematological malignancy.VELCADE is a
      small molecule to treat human malignancies. Its anti-neoplastic effect invovles several
      distinct mechanisms including inhibition of cell growth. Patients who have relapsed or are
      refractory to therapy, the standard of care is now VELCADE based on the results of previous
      clinical trials.
