  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate
      together with capecitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate
      when given together with capecitabine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of imatinib mesylate
           when administered with capecitabine in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on wound angiogenesis in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical toxicity, clinical activity, or
           surrogate biomarker activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and oral imatinib mesylate once
      or twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
