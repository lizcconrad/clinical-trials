      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saredutant (or SR48968C)
      in patients with depression.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a 100 mg dose of saredutant compared to
      placebo in patients with depression.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of saredutant, to evaluate the efficacy
      of saredutant on disability and quality of life in patients with depression, and to evaluate
      blood levels of saredutant.

      The study is a multicenter, multicountry, randomized, parallel-group, double blind, placebo
      and paroxetine-controlled study consisting of three segments (A, B, and C). Segment A is a
      1-week, placebo, single-blind period and Segment B is an 8-week, double blind period.
      Patients completing Segment B may be eligible for enrollment into Segment C, a 44-week,
      double blind extension. All randomized patients must complete a post-study visit 1 week after
      intake of the last dose of study medication.
