      Problem: Depressive symptoms are a common mental health problem following traumatic brain
      injury (TBI), occurring in up to 87% of patients. Depression following TBI has important
      consequences including poor functioning, lack of ability to return to work and family
      activities and prolonged TBI symptoms. The reason depression develops in some patients
      following TBI is unknown, making treatment difficult.

      One type of brain protein that shows genetic differences between people is called the
      serotonin transporter. People can be divided by whether or not they have a short protein (S
      allele) or a long protein (L allele) which influences the amount of serotonin transporter.
      Serotonin is a key brain chemical in depression in many mental/psychiatric illnesses. We
      think that the genetic differences in the serotonin transporter, that may not make a
      difference before TBI, may become important after TBI due to the nature of these injuries.

      Methods: A consecutive sample of 200 patients attending a TBI clinic who have sustained a
      mild-to-moderate TBI (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria) within the last
      2 months will be assessed for the presence of major depression (standard criteria,
      standardized interview). In phase I, blood samples from patients with mild-to-moderate TBI
      with depression and without depression will be checked for the presence of the 5-HTTPR
      genetic difference. This will allow us to study if the S allele is more likely in TBI
      patients with depression. In phase II, the patients with depression will be treated with the
      SSRI citalopram for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, or upon discontinuation of citalopram, depression
      will be assessed again. This will allow us to study if depressed patients with the S allele
      respond more poorly to treatment. Persons assessing depression after treatment will not know
      the genetic makeup of each patient.

      Results Expected: If the serotonin transporter genetic difference confers susceptibility to
      depression following TBI, this will provide important information on what causes depression
      following TBI and document a risk factor for depression previously unstudied in this
      population. Also, as SSRI antidepressants are used to treat depression in TBI, this study may
      identify a subgroup of TBI patients in whom different medications should be given or
      additional medications are required.
