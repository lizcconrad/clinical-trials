      To establish the efficacy of 40 mg/day doses of istradefylline for the change in Unified

      To establish the efficacy of 40mg/d doses of istradefylline for the change in UPDRS part-III
      (Motor examination) score in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients who meet entry
      criteria will be randomly assigned to receive study drug in 1 of 2 arms: Condition A (doses
      of 40mg/d istradefylline) in Period 1 followed by Condition B (matching placebo) in Period 2
      (putting 4 weeks interval phase between two periods ) or Condition B in Period 1 followed by
      Condition A in Period 2(putting 4 weeks interval phase between two periods ). Patients will
      be participated for 12 weeks and will have interim visits and end of treatment visit to
      assess the efficacy and safety of istradefylline.
