      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that tiotropium does not prolong the QT
      interval more than placebo. This will be achieved by testing non-inferiority hypothesis.

      Study Hypothesis:

      There is one primary variable to be tested for non-inferiority: tiotropium high dose compared
      to placebo:

      H0: µ(TIO,12) - µ(PBO,12) &gt;= 10 ms vs. H1: µ(TIO,12) - µ(PBO,12) &lt; 10 ms where µ(TIO,12),
      µ(PBO,12) represent the mean change from baseline QTcF between 5 minutes and 2 hours after 12
      days of treatment (taking the mean of the time-matched differences between baseline and
      post-baseline values in each treatment period) with tiotropium 54 µg, or placebo,
      respectively.

      If the data suggest that the Fridericia correction is poor for the study population, an
      alternative correction will be explored (QTcN). The other correction formula would be used as
      a replacement for the Fridericia correction and would be defined before unblinding of the
      data.

      Comparison(s):

      Placebo, moxifloxacin as active control

        All participants in the study should be healthy males or females, ranging from 21 to 50
        years of age and their body mass index (BMI) be within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (BMI calculation:
        weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). In accordance with GCP and
        the local legislation all volunteers will have given their written informed consent prior
        to admission to the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

             immunological or hormonal disorders
