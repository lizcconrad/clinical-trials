      This study will evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of cellulose sulfate vaginal gel in
      preventing pregnancy when used for 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulose sulfate has been shown in preclinical studies to have both contraceptive and
      antimicrobial properties. Clinical safety studies have shown it to be safe for use up to six
      days in women and 7 days in men, and ongoing studies are assessing its safety for twice daily
      use for 14 days in women. This study will evaluate its contraceptive effectiveness in women
      who use it for 6 months.

          6. Agree to use the study product as instructed at each act of intercourse during the
             next 30 weeks and to use no other method of contraception (Except: 1) ECPs when
             indicated, see Section VIII.C.5, or, 2) a barrier method (e.g. Gynol II, condoms) from
             pre-enrollment until the start of the first post-enrollment menses, see Section
             VIII.B.4).

          8. Do not have a known sensitivity or allergy to any vaginal preparations containing
             glycerin, sorbitol, carbomer, or benzyl alcohol. (Gyne-Lotrimin cream and Cleocin
             cream contain benzyl alcohol. Replens and Metrogel contain carbomer. K-Y jelly and
             Replens contain glycerin.)

          9. Not known or suspected to be infected by HIV and are at low risk for HIV and other
             STIs, by virtue of:

               1. Only one sexual partner in the past six months

               2. Not diagnosed with or treated for any STI in the past six months. Note:
                  Individuals with a history of genital herpes or condylomata who have been
                  asymptomatic for at least six months may be enrolled.

               4. Do not have any other risk factors known to the clinician or site staff

         10. Do not have any other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             clinician, would constitute contraindications to participation in the study, would
             complicate interpretation of data from the participant, or would compromise the
             participantâ€™s ability to comply with the study protocol, such as any major chronic
             illness including cancer, serious autoimmune disease, substance abuse or a major
