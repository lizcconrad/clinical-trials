  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, affecting young children. The pediatric
      primary care setting is an ideal place to address this problem since most families have
      frequent contact with their pediatrician and a child's health status is regularly assessed in
      this setting. Recommendations for treating children with a body mass index (BMI) over the
      85th percentile in the primary care setting have been developed by an Expert Committee on
      childhood. Programs are needed that meet the recommendations from the Committee, which
      include: 1) beginning treatment as young as possible; 2) focusing on the family, with the
      parent being the primary change agent for treatment; 3) using behavior modification
      techniques to change eating and activity behaviors; and 4) making 2 or 3 very specific
      changes in diet and activity at one time. Thus, the aim of this R21 application is to
      develop, implement, and evaluate a 6-month behavioral childhood obesity intervention that
      meets the Committee's recommendations and can be implemented in a primary care setting. A
      second aim of this project is to determine which eating and activity behaviors should be
      targeted in the intervention. One hundred thirty-five children, aged 4 to 9 years with a BMI
      &gt; 85th percentile, assessed and referred by their pediatricians, will be randomized to one of
      three conditions: 1) a newsletter condition; 2) a Behavioral Parenting Program that increases
      physical activity (60 min/day) and decreases sweetened drink consumption (&lt; 3 servings/week)
      (Traditional); or 3) a Behavioral Parenting Program that reduces TV watching (&lt; 2 hours/day)
      and increases low-fat milk consumption (2 servings/day) (Substitutes). Follow-up assessments
      on weight, height, and standardized BMI (z-BMI), the primary dependent variable, will be
      conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Pediatricians will provide follow-up letters to
      families, regarding weight and height status, following the assessments. This pilot study
      allows us to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a pediatric obesity intervention that
      optimizes the role of the pediatrician and meets the Committee's recommendations for
      treatment in a primary care setting. Moreover, by comparing the effects of targeting the
      traditional or substitute behaviors, data will be obtained for a power analysis for a
      full-scale trial of the effects of these two approaches on long-term weight loss.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Age between 4 and 9 years. We propose to use this age group since parents are in
             control of the eating and exercise choices of such children, and thus a program that
             focuses on parenting behaviors (i.e., positive reinforcement, stimulus control,
             parental modeling) should be developmentally appropriate. This age group also meets
             the Expert Committee's goal of intervening early5; moreover children aged 4 to 8 years
             have similar nutritional needs.

             2) Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 85th percentile BMI. Based upon the Expert Committee
             recommendations,5 children &gt; 2 years of age who are identified as being at risk for
             overweight (85th to 94th percentile BMI) or overweight (&gt; 95th percentile BMI) should
             focus on weight maintenance as height continues to increase. These recommendations are
             aimed at reducing z-BMI.

             3) Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal) sexual maturation status. 4) Self-report at least one
             of the following problematic behaviors:

               1. Consume &gt; 1 serving of sweetened drink per day.

               2. Consume &lt; 2 servings of low-fat milk per day.

               3. Watch &gt; 2 hours of TV per day.

               4. Engage in physical activity that makes them sweat or breath hard &lt; 5 days per
                  week.

                  These behaviors have been selected because each has been associated with
                  childhood obesity.

                  5) A parent willing to attend treatment meetings. 6) Parent and child speak
                  English.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                  Participants will be excluded if they:

                    1. Report a family member participating in another weight loss program.

                    2. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings
                       has a major psychiatric disease or organic brain syndrome.

                    3. Report that the child or parent planning to attend the treatment meetings
                       has dietary or physical activity restrictions.

                    4. Intend to move outside of the metropolitan area within the time frame of the
                       investigation.
