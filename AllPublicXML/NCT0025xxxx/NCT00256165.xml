      The purpose of this study is to obtain data regarding the left ventricular mass (LVM)
      regression 6 months after the implant of an SJM Epic™ and SJM Epic™ Supra valve by comparing
      LVM regression measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to LVM regression measured with
      echocardiography (2-dimensional [2D] mandatory; 3-dimensional [3D] in sites where the
      technology is available).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient requires, for the first time, isolated aortic valve replacement due to aortic
             stenosis or mixed aortic stenosis disease etiology when aortic stenosis is predominant
             and aortic regurgitation is mild.

          -  Patient is of legal age in the host country.

          -  Patient (or legal guardian) has signed a study specific informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient was previously operated on with any heart surgery including heart valve
             replacement or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); or underwent any form of
             myocardial revascularization in the past (including stents), etc.

          -  Patient requires any concomitant heart surgery other than the isolated native aortic
             heart valve replacement and concomitant ascending aortic replacement (e.g not allowed
             are: multiple valve replacements or concomitant CABG, pacemaker insertions, or severe
             septal hypertrophy needing surgical excision, etc.)

          -  Patient has unstable angina

          -  Patient is in New York Heart Association functional class IV

          -  Patient has significant abnormality in wall motion

          -  Patient is affected by active endocarditis.

          -  Patient has a cardiac pacemaker or automatic implanted cardiac defibrillator

          -  Patient is affected by acute aortic dissection.

          -  Patient is in chronic and persistent atrial fibrillation

          -  Patient receives hemodialysis therapy

          -  Patient has a medical condition which contraindicates implantation of the SJM Epic and
             Epic™ Supra Porcine Bioprosthetic Heart Valve (e.g. renal failure or abnormal calcium
             metabolism).

          -  Patient has aneurysmal clips or carotid artery vascular stents

          -  Patient has a neurostimulator

          -  Patient has an implanted or external drug infusion device (e.g. insulin pump)

          -  Patient has a bone growth/fusion stimulator

          -  Patient has a cochlear, otologic, or ear implant

          -  Patients with severe claustrophobia in which medical sedation is contraindicated or
             unable to resolve anxiety sufficiently

          -  Patients with ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)

          -  Patient is pregnant or nursing
