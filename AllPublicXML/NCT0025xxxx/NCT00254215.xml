  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the hypothesis that reducing the glycemic load of the diet will improve
      changes in body composition and cardio-vascular risk factors. The study compares a
      conventional reduced-fat, high carbohydrate diet with 3 means of reducing glycemic load:
      changing the carbohydrates to low-GI choices, replacing some of the carbohydrate with
      protein, or combining both effects to produce the lowest glycemic load.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional low fat diets produce modest wegiht loss at best and the results are not well
      maintained. More recently there has been interest in low glycemic index and high protien
      diets wiht some evidence that these produce better fat loss and improvement in cardiovascular
      risk factors. This trial aims to evaluate these different approaches and compare the outcomes
      over 12 weeks. Major outcomes are weigth loss, body composition change, blood lipids change,
      measures of glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, leptin and CRP.
