  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of cisplatin and irinotecan has significant anti-tumor activity in esophageal
      cancer. Oxaliplatin has been shown to have activity in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5FU)
      and radiation in treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin also has better
      side effects profile than cisplatin and may be able to overcome tumors that have developed
      cisplatin resistance. The standard treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer has been
      cisplatin, 5FU and radiation followed by possible esophagectomy. However, a large portion of
      these patients will relapse and the tumor may develop resistance to cisplatin and/or the
      cumulative toxicity from previous treatment forbids the use of cisplatin again. Weekly
      combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has been shown to be active and well tolerated in
      elderly population with refractory colorectal cancer. Therefore, we propose this phase II
      trial of a weekly oxaliplatin and irinotecan to test the effectiveness and the tolerability
      of this regimen in metastatic and/or recurrent esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer represents the seventh cause of cancer death in American men, and more than
      90% of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer will ultimately die of their disease. In the
      United States, 13,900 new cases of esophageal cancer and 13,000 deaths from esophageal cancer
      are anticipated in 2003 (Jemal et al, 2003). The lifetime risk of esophageal cancer is 0.8%
      for men and 0.3% for women (Ries et al, 2002). The risk increases with age, with a mean age
      at diagnosis of 67 years (Ries et al, 2002; Daly et al, 2000). Adenocarcinoma of the
      esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, a previously rare disease, is rapidly increasing in
      incidence in the United States and western countries and now accounts for more than half of
      newly diagnosed disease (Devesa et al, 1998).

      Half of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer present with overt metastatic disease, and
      chemotherapy is the mainstay of palliation in this setting. In patients who present initially
      with locoregional disease, the majority will eventually develop metastatic disease as well,
      with or without local recurrence of disease. Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an incurable
      disease with median survival duration of 4 to 8 months. Combination chemotherapy, most often
      cisplatin-based, results in partial responses in 25% to 50% of patients with metastatic
      disease and rare complete responses, including a 35% response rate reported for the commonly
      used combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil (Ilson et al, 1996). Recent chemotherapy
      trials indicate an overlap in response rates for metastatic adenocarcinoma and squamous
      carcinoma carcinoma of the esophagus (Ilson et al, 1997). Responses to chemotherapy are
      generally short-lived, and toxicity of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, particularly in the
      palliation of metastatic disease, is often substantial and underscores the need to identify
      new agents in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous
             cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with tumors of the
             gastroesophageal junction were eligible if at least 50% of the tumor involved the
             esophagus.

          -  Patients must have locally advanced (i.e. unresectable) or metastatic disease

          -  All sites of disease must be assessed and designated as measurable or non-measurable
             disease as documented by CT, MRI, X-ray physical Each of the criteria in the following
             section must be met in order for a patient to be eligible for registration.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiotherapy if there has been complete recovery from
             all radiation-induced toxicities. At least 4 weeks must have been elapsed from the
             completion of radiation therapy to the time of registration. If lesions within the
             radiation port are to be used to assess response to therapy, those lesions must have
             demonstrated clear progression by the criteria outlined in Section 10.2d following
             completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow reserve as documented by absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) &gt; 1,500 microliters and platelets &gt; 100,000/microliter obtained within 14
             days prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic as documented by serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal. Serum transaminase (SGOT or SGPT) must be &lt; 1.5 x
             the institutional upper limit of normal serum unless the liver is involved with tumor,
             in which case serum transaminase (SGOT or SGPT) must be &lt; 5 x the institutional limit
             of normal. These tests must be obtained within 14 days prior to registration.

        Patients must have a creatinine &lt; 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal or a
        creatinine clearance of &gt; 30 cc/min calculated using the following formula obtained within
        28 days prior to registration.

        Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X wt (kg) X (0.85 if female) 72 X creatinine
        (mg/dl)

        These tests must have been performed within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  All patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance of 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy for chemotherapy for advanced or
             metastatic esophageal cancer. Chemotherapy given adjuvantly or as a radiosensitizer is
             allowed if more than 8 weeks have elapsed since the treatment was completed and they
             have recovered from any treatment related toxicity.

          -  Patients must not have a surgical procedure for esophageal cancer within 4 weeks prior
             to registration. Patients must have completely recovered from all surgery prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients with any evidence of active or uncontrolled infection, recent myocardial
             infection, unstable angina, or life-threatening arrhythmia are not eligible.

          -  Patients with severe psychiatric disorder are not eligible.

          -  Patients with known brain metastasis are not eligible. However, brain-imaging studies
             are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurological signs or symptoms.
             If brain-imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer, or adequately treated Stage I and II
             cancer from which the patient is in complete remission, or any other malignancy from
             which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

             pre-existing major medical conditions.

          -  Patients should not have any immediate life-threatening complications of their
