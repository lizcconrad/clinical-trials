  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program is designed for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. The study is designed for patients whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot
      be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. Patients at this stage of their
      disease traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both treatments in
      succession. Recently, the administration of both methods of treatment has been employed and
      preliminary studies indicate somewhat better results. Specifically, a new class of
      chemotherapy agents called taxanes used in combination with radiation therapy appear
      promising as determined in small studies. However, the best treatment for this type of cancer
      has not been established yet. One goal of this study is to investigate if the combination of
      the new drug Taxotere (a drug belonging to the taxane class) given on the day of the
      radiation is well tolerated and will result in enhanced shrinkage of the cancer compared to
      traditional radiation therapy. In this study the radiation will be given on one day, rather
      than divided over five days per week (Monday through Friday) as in previous studies. Previous
      research has shown that both equal in how effective they are in treating lung cancer. The
      study will use the drug Taxotere in conjunction with radiation therapy. Taxotere is an
      approved medicine by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of lung
      cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the chemotherapy drug Taxotere administered once
      weekly together with concurrent radiation on the same day is effective in shrinking non-small
      cell lung cancer. This trial will also investigate how well this treatment is tolerated and
      what effects this treatment will have on the everyday life and activities of participants.

      40 patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled (stages III and IV)
      and treated once per week for a total of 12 cycles (12 weeks) according to the schedule
      outlined below.

      Chemotherapy: The suggested phase II dose for weekly Taxotere with concomitant standard chest
      radiotherapy was determined to be 20mg/m2. In our unpublished phase I clinical trial, we
      found 35 mg/m2 to be well tolerated and therefore this dose is chosen for this phase II
      study. The drug will be administered intravenously on the same day as the radiation. All
      patients will be premedicated 12 hours prior to chemotherapy with Decadrone. Patients will be
      followed and evaluated weekly by a physician.

      Radiation therapy: Although radiation was delivered differently in previous Taxotere based
      combined modality studies, the total radiation dose remains the same. Treatment will be given
      to a large field with a 2-3 cm tumor margin. All involved or suspicious nodal areas will be
      radiated as well. To reduce volume toxicity, the &quot;field within a field&quot; technique will be
      employed. Tumor and involved nodes will receive 200 cGy + 300 cGy. A total of 12 treatments
      will be administered in weekly, single sessions. Total treatment will be 6000 cGy. Radiation
      treatment will be administered 24 hours after Taxotere infusion.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologic evidence of NSCLC.

          2. Should the patient have a history of another malignancy or a second malignancy be
             present or discovered, subjects will only be eligible if the NSCLC is determined by
             the PI to be the more life-threatening disease and the other malignancy would not have
             otherwise a significant impact on the subjects life-expectancy (e.g. basal cell
             carcinoma of skin, remote history of early stage breast cancer surgically cured).

          3. All patients must have surgically incurable disease, i.e. locally advanced disease
             (stage III A or III B) or metastatic stage IV.

          4. Performance status of 0 to 2 (ECOG Criteria).

          5. Patients should have an absolute granulocyte count &gt; 1500/mm3 and a platelet count &gt;
             100,000/mm3.

          6. Patients should have adequate hepatic function as indicated by a serum bilirubin &lt;
             upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT and AST &lt;2.5 ULN if alkaline phosphatase is &lt; ULN.
             Alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if transaminases are &lt; ULN. However,
             patients who have both transaminase elevation &gt; 1.5 x ULN and alkaline phosphatase &gt;
             2.5 x ULN are not eligible for this study.

          7. Patients should have at least a predicted FEV1 of 30%.

          8. Patients with active ischemic heart disease (NYHA Class III or IV), congestive heart
             failure, symptomatic arrythmias, or a recent history of a myocardial infarction are
             excluded.

          9. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy (&gt; grade 1) are not eligible for this study.

         10. No other serious concurrent medical illness or active infection which would jeopardize
             the ability of the patient to receive with reasonable safety the chemotherapy and
             surgery program outlined in this protocol is allowed.

         11. Signed informed consent: each patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of
