      1.1 To collect pathological tumor specimens of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in
      a prospective fashion for correlative studies of response to an oxaliplatin based
      chemotherapy regimen.

      1.2 To determine a gene expression profile that predicts response to an oxaliplatin based
      chemotherapy regimen in this cohort of patients.

      This is a single-arm, non-randomized trial of oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Patients that are
      placed on other studies that utilize the same chemotherapy regimen can enter this study.
      Those patients will be treated according to the clinical study on which they have been
      entered. For patients not on another clinical trial, the treatment outlined below should be
      followed.

    <description>Oxaliplatin will be administered at the dose of 130 mg/m2 given as a 2 hour intravenous infusion on day 1 of a three week cycle, prior to the 1st dose of capecitabine. 5-HT3 antagonists with or without dexamethasone premedication are strongly recommended. Oxaliplatin may be infused either through a peripheral vein or a central venous line. The infusion lines must be adequately flushed with 5% dextrose solution (D5W) between oxaliplatin infusion &amp; the administration of any other drug.
Capecitabine is to be administered orally within 30 mins. after the end of a meal. Tablets should be swallowed with approximately 200 mL water (not fruit juices). The first dose of each cycle will be administered as the evening dose on day 1 &amp; the last dose of each cycle is scheduled the morning of day 15, followed by a 7 day rest period. This provides for a total of 28 single doses per cycle over 15 calendar days.</description>

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent.

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral

             of a regular red blood cell transfusion requirement.

          -  Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and
             SGOT or SGPT &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as
             defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  The patient must agree to a biopsy of a sample of tumor for correlative studies.

          -  The patient is an appropriate candidate for oxaliplatin/capecitabine based
             chemotherapy.

          -  The patient must have measurable disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child
             bearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this
             trial.

          -  Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or
             cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Patients may not have received oxaliplatin previously.

          -  Patients with a prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy, or
