      The purpose of this study is to provide a repository for long-term storage of endometrial
      cancer tumor and normal tissue, ascites and serum. This material will be used in studies to
      better understand the molecular biology of endometrial cancer.

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

      This protocol will create a central repository for banking tumor and other tissues as well as
      serum from patients with uterine corpus tumors. In addition, this protocol will also serve as
      a central repository for serum and tissue to healthy post-menopausal and peri-menopausal
      controls.

      There will be an &quot;internal&quot; bank. The internal bank will have samples available to UNM
      investigators.
