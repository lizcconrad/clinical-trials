  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind three-arm trial to evaluate two dosages of CVT-E002 against
      placebo in pediatric upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). It is hypothesized that
      CVT-E002 use at standard doses reduces the duration of URTI in children aged 3-12 years.

      The eligible children, for whom parental consent has been obtained, will be randomized to one
      of three groups (standard dose, low dose, or placebo). The standard dose group will receive
      an oral aqueous solution using the standard dose of CVT-E002, adjusted according to the
      child's weight. The second group will receive an oral aqueous solution with half of the
      standard dose of CVT-E002, adjusted according to the child's weight, and the third group will
      receive a placebo as an aqueous solution of starch that does not contain any CVT-E002 or
      active medication, volume adjusted for the child's weight. Parents will be provided with a
      3-day supply of study medication according to the randomization schedule. CVT-E002 will be
      administered by the parent to the child three times daily for three consecutive days
      following the onset of a URTI. Severity and duration of URTI will be measured using the
      reliable and valid Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection Flu Score (CARIFS).
