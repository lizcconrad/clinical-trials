  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing dysfunction after stroke is common, but there is no reliable evidence for how it
      should be managed other than perhaps by nasogastric tube. This study compared the
      effectiveness of standardised, low and high intensity behavioral intervention for dysphagia
      with that of “usual care”.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke compromises swallowing function, causing dysphagia, in one quarter to one half of all
      patients. Dysphagia is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, dehydration
      and malnutrition. Despite the development and implementation of several strategies of
      managing dysphagia after stroke, Few have been evaluated by means of randomised controlled
      trials.

      Comparisons: This study aims to compare stroke patients with dysphagia assigned to receive
      usual swallowing care, prescribed by the attending physician; standardised low intensity
      intervention comprising swallowing compensation strategies and diet prescription; or
      standardised high intensity intervention and dietary prescription .
