      This study will evaluate and gather information in patients with genetic causes of too much
      androgen (male-like hormone) in order to better understand the effects of too much androgen
      and describe problems associated with it. Too much androgen in childhood, if untreated,
      results in rapid growth and early puberty with early cessation of growth and short stature in
      adulthood. Too much androgen in adulthood may result in infertility, and women may have
      excess facial hair, acne and a more male-like appearance. Excess androgen may also affect
      mood and behavior and possibly the secretion of other hormones, such as insulin. Two genetic
      diseases that result in early childhood androgen excess are congenital adrenal hyperplasia
      (CAH) and familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP).

      Patients with known or suspected CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11- hydroxylase
      deficiency, or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency and males with known or
      suspected FMPP may be eligible for this study. Patients with both classic and non-classic CAH
      are eligible, and patients with androgen excess of unknown cause may be eligible.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Fasting blood tests for analysis of hormones, blood chemistries including blood sugar
           and cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids.

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test for patients with elevated insulin levels. For this test, a
           catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the patient's arm. The patient drinks a
           sugar-containing fluid and blood samples are collected through the catheter at intervals
           starting with drinking the solution, and then 30, 60 and 120 minutes after drinking the
           solution.

        -  24-hour urine collection to measure hormone levels in the urine.

        -  DNA testing for patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency to help identify the type of
           genetic mutation responsible for the disease.

        -  X-ray of the left hand to measure bone age in growing children. The x-ray is used to
           determine how far into puberty the child is and how much growth potential is left in the
           bones.

        -  A pelvic ultrasound in females and testicular ultrasound in males to evaluate the size
           and development of the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males).

        -  Cognitive and psychological tests, including an IQ test and evaluation of memory,
           achievement and behavior.

        -  Other tests and evaluations based on medical need.

      The schedule for these procedures varies. In a part of the study involving only patients with
      CAH, growing children are evaluated twice (once in childhood and once after reaching adult
      height), and adults are evaluated once. In another part of the study involving patients with
      CAH and FMPP, growing children are seen twice a year, and adults and children who have
      reached adult height may be seen annually. Additional visits may be scheduled if medically
      indicated. In this part of the study, females are asked to keep a record of their periods
      after their first menstrual cycle.

      Androgen excess in childhood results in pseudoprecocious puberty, accelerated childhood
      growth with premature epiphyseal fusion, adult short stature, and unknown metabolic and
      psychological perturbations. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and familial male-limited
      precocious puberty (FMPP) are two genetic diseases that result in early childhood androgen
      excess, and CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism
      in childhood. This protocol will elucidate a comprehensive phenotypic profile for patients
      with CAH and FMPP. Data will be collected in a large cohort of patients regarding growth and
      development, hormonal and metabolic factors and psychological characteristics. This protocol
      will allow investigators to compare patients with androgen excess of different etiologies,
      elucidate androgen-mediated and disease-specific phenotypic characterizations, and allow the
      investigators to acquire further knowledge for use in the design of future therapeutic
      interventions.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Males , ages 0 - 99 with known or suspected FMPP.

               2. Patients (males and females, ages 0 - 99) with known (based on hormonal, clinical
                  and/or genetic testing) CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-hydroxylase
