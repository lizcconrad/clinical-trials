  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare fasting and postprandial PYY levels between
      overweight/obese and lean subjects during and after an infusion of saline, PYY1-36 or PYY3-36
      and to evaluate the efects on appetite, energy intake and energy expenditure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised dobbelblinded placebo controlled study with 24 male subjects ( 12
      lean and 12 overweight/obese subjects). VAS scores are used to assess appetite and two ad
      libitum meals are served in the hours following the infusion. Energy expenditure is measured
      by ventilated hood system and blood is sampled during part of the study day.
