  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with symptomatic malignant SVCO deemed suitable for treatment either with
      radiation therapy or by stenting will be eligible. They will receive whichever treatment is
      deemed most clinically appropriate. Symptomatic response, time to onset of palliation,
      duration of symptom control and survival will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic clinical and radiological diagnosis of superior vena caval obstruction.

          -  Underlying histological diagnosis deemed appropriate for palliative radiotherapy as
             treatment by investigator. Patients with chemosensitive tumours such as small cell
             lung cancer (both untreated and recurrent), lymphoma and testicular tumours, will be
             eligible if radiation is deemed to be appropriate treatment.
