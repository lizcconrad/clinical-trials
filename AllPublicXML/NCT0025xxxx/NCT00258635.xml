    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunological differences between three
      RagweedMATAMPL treatment arms compared to placebo with respect to immunoglobulin levels.

      In addition, the study will assess the reduced allergenicity of modified Ragweed Pollen
      contained in RagweedMATAMPL compared to unmodified native allergen using skin prick testing.
