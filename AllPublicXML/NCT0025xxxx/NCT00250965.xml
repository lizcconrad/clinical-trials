  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our research is to determine whether treatment with magnesium will reduce
      the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Several small
      studies of magnesium have already been conducted, but these studies were small and the
      results conflicting. A large, well-conducted study of magnesium treatment is required to
      definitively determine whether magnesium is effective in preventing this common complication
      after surgery. In addition, our study will include patients undergoing valvular surgery, a
      group previously excluded from research despite the fact that they are at increased risk of
      atrial fibrillation.

      All patients referred for non-emergent cardiac surgery for isolated CABG, isolated valvular
      heart surgery, or combined valvular and CABG surgery are eligible for the study. Subjects
      will be randomized prior to surgery (1:1) to receive 5 g magnesium or placebo (saline) bolus
      by the anaesthesiologist upon removal of the crossclamp. On postoperative days 1 through 4,
      subjects will receive either IV MgSO4 (5g in 250 ml normal saline) or IV placebo (250 ml
      normal saline) infusion over 4 hours daily. Atrial fibrillation (and other arrhythmias) will
      be detected by placing all subjects on continuous 24-hour ECG telemetry monitoring for
      postoperative days 0 through 4.

      The study is powered to detect at least a 30% relative reduction in postoperative atrial
      fibrillation in the CABG group; n=756. Because of the higher incidence of atrial fibrillation
      in the Valve +/- CABG group a total of 500 patients will be required to detect at least a 30%
      difference between treatment groups. These sample sizes are based on an alpha of 0.05 and 80%
      power.
