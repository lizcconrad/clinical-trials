  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dasatinib can help to control
      myeloproliferative disorders. The safety and tolerability of dasatinib will also be studied.

    <textblock>
      Dasatinib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that is designed to block the function of
      BCR-ABL, which is the abnormal protein responsible for causing leukemia in some cells.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take dasatinib by mouth
      twice a day. If you have mastocytosis, you will take dasatinib by mouth once a day. A
      treatment cycle will be defined as 4 weeks (28 days) + 7 days. You will be instructed to take
      dasatinib in the morning (between about 6:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m.) and in the evening (between
      about 6:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m.).

      Blood tests (about 2 - 3 teaspoons) will be done once a week for a month, then once a month
      for 5 years, then once every 6 months (if your doctor thinks it is needed) for the remainder
      of your treatment on this study. A bone marrow biopsy will be done after 1-2 months of
      therapy to document response.

      Dasatinib will be given for as long as you are responding. You will be taken off study if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is authorized for use in research only. A total
      of 145 patients will take part in this study. All will be treated at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients &gt;/= 18 years old who meet the following eligibility criteria

          2. Patients must have one of the following hematopoietic malignancies: C-kit positive
             (10% or more BM or PB MNC positive by flow) acute myeloid leukemia (AML excluding
             acute promyelocytic leukemia) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of the following
             types: Refractory-relapse AML-MDS including those who fail to achieve CR after the
             first cycle of induction; Second or subsequent AML-MDS refractory-relapse; Newly
             diagnosed AML-MDS patients over 60 years of age with karyotype other than t(15:17),
             inv16, t(8:21), who do not want chemotherapy.

          3. (Con't from # 2) Patients with MDS who do not want chemotherapy as initial treatment,
             or who are not eligible for the treatments of higher priority.

          4. Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia - myelofibrosis (MMM)

          5. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)

          6. Polycythemia vera (PV)

          7. Mastocytosis

          8. Serum bilirubin less than 2mg%, serum creatinine less than 2mg% unless abnormality is
             considered due to hematologic malignancy by investigator.

         12. Continued from #11: In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the
             risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should practice an effective
             method of birth control.Women and men must continue birth control for the duration of
             the trial and at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

         13. Inclusion of women and minorities: As per NIH policy, women and members of minorities
             will be included in this protocol as they are referred in the relevant populations.

             product. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive
             investigational product and must not be enrolled in the study.
