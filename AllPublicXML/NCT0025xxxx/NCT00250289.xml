  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the use of a herbal formulation containing sage, echinacea,lavender and mastic gum would
      prevent oral malodor if delivered in an appropriate delivery system to enable slow release of
      the active ingredients.

    <textblock>
      Oral malodor (Halitosis, Fetor ex ora) is a common and disturbing condition, affecting
      according to some studies about one quarter of the population. This condition may start at
      any time from early childhood through adolescence, adulthood and old age and vary in
      character and severity.The bacteria responsible for malodor production are for the most part
      Gram negative oral bacteria (2- 4) such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum
      and Prevotella intermedia. These bacteria reside on various locations within the oral cavity
      (e.g. tongue dorsum, interdental space, periodontal pockets, tonsils) and breakdown salivary
      and oral proteins into their amino acid building blocks. Some of these amino acids (e.g.
      methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, lysine) are further metabolized yielding malodorous
      volatile products such as methylmercaptan, hydrogen sulfide, indole, skatole and cadaverine
      (5-7). These are foul smelling compounds, which are released during exhalation and speech.in
      our study we intend to use an aprooved mucosal sticker containing carbopol and
      hydroxypropylcellulose mixed with the herbal ingredients and placed on the palatal
      mucosa.than mesure the volatile sulfur compounds to observe if the composition has
      antimalodor effect and for how long. the herbal ingredients are used for many years for
      medicinal and nutritional purposes. if our hypothesis is right we might have another
      formulation and method of application to prevent oral malodor
