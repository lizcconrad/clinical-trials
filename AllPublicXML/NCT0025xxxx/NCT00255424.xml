  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ferumoxytol as compared
      to oral iron in the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients. Patients are
      randomized to receive either two doses of 510 mg of ferumoxytol within one week or 200 mg
      oral elemental iron daily for three weeks.
