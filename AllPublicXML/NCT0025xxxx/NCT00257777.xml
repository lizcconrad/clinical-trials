  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversies still exists concerning the overall clinical effects of blood-based vs.
      crystalloid- based cardioplegic solution for myocardial protection during cardiac arrest.
      Both techniques are used world-wide. No larger prospectively randomized studies comparing the
      two methods have been reported. The aim of this study is to collect a large number of
      clinical data to create a proper basis for evaluation of the two techniques.

      All patients admitted for aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant CABG and
      operated by E.Ø. or G.T. are included in the study. All preoperative, operative and
      postoperative data are prospectively recorded, focusing on clinical outcome parameters
