  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that infusion of VIP may induce headache in healthy subjects and that VIP
      induced headache may be associated with dilatation of intra- and extracerebral blood vessels.
      To test this hypothesis, we performed a double blind placebo controlled crossover study in
      normal human volunteers and studied the effect on headache and cerebral as well as
      hemodynamic parameters.

      We hypothesized that infusion of VIP may induce headache in healthy subjects and that VIP
      induced headache may be associated with dilatation of intra- and extracerebral blood vessels.
      To test this hypothesis, we performed a double blind placebo controlled crossover study in
      normal human volunteers and studied the effect on headache and cerebral as well as
      hemodynamic parameters. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, the subjects
      were randomly allocated to receive 8 pmol/kg/min VIP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 25
      min. Headache intensity, Mean velocity of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery
      (VmeanMCA), superfical temporal artery diameter, PetCO2, adverse events and vital signs were
      recorded at T-10, T0 and then every 10 min until 120 min after start of infusion. Single
      photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was performed at T-0, T20 and T60.
