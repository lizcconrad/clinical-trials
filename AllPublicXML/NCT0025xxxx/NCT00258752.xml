    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious medical illness that is difficult to diagnose and treat, especially
      in children and adolescents. Signs of depression in children may include the following
      behaviors: pretending to be sick; refusing to go to school; clinging to a parent; or worrying
      that a parent may die. Older children may sulk, behave inappropriately at school, act in a
      negative or grouchy manner, or feel misunderstood. Because normal behaviors vary from one
      childhood stage to another, it can be difficult to determine whether a child is going through
      a temporary &quot;phase&quot; or is suffering from depression. This study will compare IPT-AST,
      Enhanced IPT-AST, and Usual Care for the prevention of adolescent depression.

      Participation in this single-blind study will last approximately 21 months. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive either IPT-AST, Enhanced IPT-AST, or Usual Care for 12 weeks.
      IPT-AST is a school-based group intervention program that focuses on prevention,
      psychoeducation, and interpersonal skill-building. Enhanced IPT-AST will entail IPT-AST plus
      three parent-adolescent sessions. Usual Care will consist of standard treatments and will not
      include IPT-AST. Study visits will occur before and during the intervention at baseline and
      Weeks 6 and 12. Follow-up visits will occur 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. Study
      visit assessments will include depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses,
      overall functioning, social adjustment, parent-child conflict, perceived support from parents
      and peers, and service utilization.
