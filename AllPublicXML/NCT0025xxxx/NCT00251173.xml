      The proposed study will compare three alternative interventions in the emergency department
      (ED) to promote linkage to substance abuse assessment, referral and treatment entry for those
      who meet abuse/dependence criteria for stimulants, cannabis, and/or non-injected opioids: (1)
      a 5-session Strengths-Based Case Management (SBCM) model; (2) a 2-session Brief Motivational
      Enhancement (BME); or (3) a one-time Brief Informational Feedback (BIF) session. The primary
      outcome variables for this trial include receiving an assessment and referral and treatment
      entry. Other outcomes include degree of treatment completion, substance-related measures,
      health service utilization, health status changes, and psychosocial factors.

    <arm_group_label>Strengths Based Case Management Model (SBCM)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Strengths Based Case Management Model (SBCM) consists of 5 case-management sessions designed to promote linkage and engagement in assessment and treatment services, while assisting with the patient's perceived needs, as well as personal strengths and barriers to linkage and engagement.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)</arm_group_label>

    <description>The MET therapist will conduct 2 motivational enhancement sessions to work through the content of an educational workbook targeting the participant's substance use/abuse with the goal of negotiating a 'contract' to: 1) link to services, with the eventual goal of seeking and receiving specialized substance treatment; or 2) provide a strategy to self-monitor substance use, consider consequences, and later seek assessment.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive brief informational feedback on the results of their alcohol screening and assessment and encouragement to seek treatment.</description>
