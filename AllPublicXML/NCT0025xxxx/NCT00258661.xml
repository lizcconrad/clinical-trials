  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) were used in the 1800s and 1900s to treat pneumonia
      before the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1900s. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if OMT, when used in conjunction with antibiotics and other usual care, will
      improve the recovery of elderly pneumonia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center study conducted across five sites in the United States to
      determine the efficacy of combining Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment(OMT)with antibiotics
      as a treatment regimen for elderly patients with pneumonia. The study is a prospective,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial, in which 360 subjects will be randomly assigned to
      three different groups to test the primary hypothesis that the combination of OMT and
      antibiotics will decrease the length of hospital stay for elderly patients with pneumonia.
      The first group (OMT Group) will receive a series of eight osteopathic manipulative
      techniques in combination with conventional antibiotic care. The second group (Light Touch
      Control Group) will receive a light touch mimic treatment in combination with conventional
      antibiotic care to control for the doctor-patient interaction. The third group (Conventional
      Care Only Group) will receive only the conventional antibiotic care normally given to elderly
      patients with pneumonia. The first two groups will receive two 15-20 minute treatments per
      day, at least six hours apart, for the duration of their stay in the acute care facility.

      The primary outcomes for measuring efficacy are: Length of Hospital Stay, Time to Clinical
      Stability, and Rate of Symptomatic and Functional Recovery. The secondary outcomes are:
      duration of IV and oral antibiotic usage in the hospital, number of complications and deaths
      secondary to pneumonia, re-admission rate within 60 days of hospitalization admission date,
      duration and severity of fever, duration and severity of leukocytosis, and patient
      satisfaction.
