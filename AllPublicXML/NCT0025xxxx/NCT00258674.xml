      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of physician profiling and care
      coordination by a diabetes resource nurse in improving the quality of diabetes care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HealthTexas Provider Network primary care practices with at least 10 Medicare diabetes
      patients over the age of 65 were randomized to one of 3 intervention arms: physician feedback
      of process measures using Medicare claims data (&quot;Claims&quot;); feedback of Medicare claims data
      plus clinical measures from medical record abstraction (&quot;Claims+MR&quot;); or both types of
      feedback plus a practice-based DRN (&quot;DRN&quot;). For the 12 months prior to the intervention and
      12 months post-intervention, performance data on diabetes related processes of care (annual
      HbA1c testing, annual LDL cholesterol screening, annual hypertension screening, annual eye,
      foot, and renal assessment) and patient outcomes (HbA1c level, LDL cholesterol level, blood
      pressure) were collected from medical record abstraction and Medicare claims data. Pre-post
      change scores will be compared between intervention arms to examine effectiveness of
      physician profiling and care coordination by a diabetes resource nurse.

    <measure>Change Score for &quot;HbA1c &lt;9 Percent&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure compared baseline values (01/01/2000-12/31/2000) to follow-up values (01/01/2001-12/31/2001)</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was assigned a &quot;change score&quot; of -1, 0, or 1. A positive value indicated a patient non-adherent to the guideline recommendation for HbA1c &lt;9 percent at baseline had achieved such a level at follow up. Patient-level change scores were then summed and averaged over each study arm.</description>

    <description>Each patient was assigned a &quot;change score&quot; of -1, 0, or 1.

A positive value indicated a patient who was non-compliant with the guideline recommendation for an annual renal function assessment in the baseline period was compliant in the follow-up period. Patients missing either a baseline or follow-up value were excluded. Patient-level change scores were then summed and averaged over each study arm.</description>

            <groups_desc>We used a three-stage hierarchical model estimate the effect of the interventions on the change in endpoint from baseline to follow-up. Change scores for dichotomous measures were scored as –1, 0, or 1, with a positive value indicating increased guideline adherence or increased incidence of that process. We used ordered logistic models to test the hypothesis that patients in the intervention groups were more likely to meet guidelines or to receive these processes of care.</groups_desc>

      <time_frame>This study was conducted from 1/1/2000-12/31/2001. All the interventions tested were at the practice level and did not directly impact patient care. Since patients were receiving 'usual care', no adverse event data were collected.</time_frame>
      <desc>The interventions tested were all tools/resources to help practices improve performance on diabetes quality measures. All decisions about patient treatment remained with the individual physicians, at their discretion. Thus, patients were not placed at additional risk through the practices' participation in the study, and adverse events not tracked.</desc>
