  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy and radical radiation therapy remain the standard treatment approaches
      for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (T1, T2).Radical prostatectomy is most
      effective when the disease is organ confined at the time of surgery. However, in many series
      up to 60% of patients have positive resection margins at the time of surgery and there is
      evidence to suggest that these patients may not be curable by surgery alone. A number of
      preoperative clinical variables including clinical stage, serum Prostate Specific Antigen
      (PSA) and Gleason scorea re helpful in determining the probability of finding organ confined
      disease at the time of syrgery.
