      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs or substances to keep cancer from
      forming, growing, or coming back. The use of broccoli sprout extract may prevent lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well broccoli sprout extract works in preventing
      lung cancer in smokers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effect of broccoli sprout extract on levels of DNA adducts in participants
           who smoke.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of broccoli sprout extract in reducing tobacco-carcinogen
           induced DNA adducts in these participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of broccoli sprout extract on markers of the Nrf2 pathway in these
           participants.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of broccoli sprout extract, in increasing the activity of
           the Nrf2 pathway, in these participants.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of using lymphocytes and buccal cells to monitor DNA adducts
           and changes in the Nrf2 pathway in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants are stratified according to GST genotypic polymorphism (M1 vs T1).

      Participants receive oral broccoli sprout extract daily for 3 weeks. Participants keep a
      daily diary of their eating and smoking habits for 3 weeks before, during, and for 3 weeks
      after study treatment. They must continue to smoke during the study, but are encouraged to
      quit after completing the study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 participants will be accrued for this study.
