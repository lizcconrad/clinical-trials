      RATIONALE: Cyclophosphamide may help control the symptoms of autoimmune enteropathy .

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cyclophosphamide works in treating young
      patients with severe autoimmune enteropathy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of treatment-free remission in young patients with severe autoimmune
           enteropathy treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4. Patients then receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing for 3
      days or until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1½ years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-11 patients will be accrued for this study.
