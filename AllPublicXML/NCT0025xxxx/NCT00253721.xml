      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      drugs directly into the arteries around the tumor may kill more tumor cells. Mannitol may
      open the blood vessels around the brain [Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption (BBBD)]and allow
      melphalan to be carried directly to the brain tumor. Giving melphalan together with BBBD may
      be an effective treatment for central nervous system cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying side effects and best dose of melphalan when given
      together with mannitol in treating patients with central nervous system cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intra-arterial melphalan when given in
           combination with BBBD in patients with primary or metastatic central nervous system
           (CNS) malignancy.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of melphalan given with BBBD in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan.

      Patients receive intra-arterial mannitol with BBBD followed by intra-arterial melphalan over
      10 minutes on days 1 and 2*. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 monthly courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .

      NOTE: *Patients with gliomas localized to the posterior circulation (i.e., brain stem
      gliomas) receive melphalan on day 1 only.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year; every 6
      months for the next 2 years; then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
