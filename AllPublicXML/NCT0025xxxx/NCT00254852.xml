  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Optecure™ as an autograft extender (treatment) to
      autograft alone (control) in patients undergoing 1 or 2 level fusion of the lumbar spine(one
      level is defined as two adjacent vertebrae), L2 and below.

      The primary endpoint will be the assessment of fusion by evaluation of x-rays taken following
      surgery at each visit. The x-ray evaluation will be conducted by a radiologist who is blinded
      to the type of treatment each patient has received.

      Subjects will be seen at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperative
      (post-op). Questionnaires and x-rays will be completed at each visit and a computed
      tomography (CT) scan will be taken at the 12 month visit(and used to aid in assessment of
      bridging bone, where appropriate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autograft (bone taken from one part of the body and placed in another site on the same
      individual) has long been considered the gold standard for lumbar spine fusion procedures.
      Unfortunately, there are complications involved with autograft harvest such as donor site
      morbidity, increased operating time, and limited supply. Therefore, the use of allograft
      (bone taken from one body and placed into another individual) as a graft extender has become
      an acceptable practice, especially in fusions of more than one level where larger quantities
      of graft material are needed.

      In this study, comparisons will be made between patients who are randomized to having fusion
      with an allograft material (Optecure, Exactech, Inc.) mixed with an autograft to those
      patients who are randomized to having fusion with autograft alone.
