      The proposed study will be a 6-week open label study evaluating aripiprazole in the treatment
      of 12 male post-pubertal adolescents (13-17 years, Tanner Stage 4) diagnosed with conduct
      disorder. The initial dose depending on the weight of the patient will be as follows: &lt; 25 kg
      = 1 mg/d; 25-50 kg = 2 mg/d; 50-70 kg = 5 mg/d; &gt; 70 kg = 10 mg/d (Data on File, 2003,
      Bristol-Myers Squibb). For the first two weeks of the study, the dose will be flexible based
      on response and tolerance and thereafter will remain fixed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of atypical antipsychotics in children began in 1992 with several small case series
      with clozapine. Since that time, five other atypical agents, risperidone, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole have been introduced into the US market. The newer
      atypical agents are not associated with agranulocytosis that has limited the usefulness of
      clozapine. Among the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone has remained the most extensively
      studied in children and adolescents, for a variety of problems, including Tourette's
      disorder, conduct disorder, schizophrenia, aggression, and pervasive development disorder.
      Risperidone has been shown to be an effective treatment in many of these disorders. However,
      weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are troublesome adverse
      effects more commonly associated with risperidone such that the drug's utility in this aged
      patient population is limited. We expect that the utility of aripiprazole in treating the
      pediatric population will not be limited by adverse effects like the other atypical
      antipsychotics.

    <measure>The Primary Outcome Efficacy Measure: Rating of Aggression Against People and/or Property Scale (RAAPP) (Kemph et al 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of Aggression Against People and/or Property Scale (RAAPP) (Kemph et al 1993) is a global rating scale of aggression completed by clinicians. Score given based on following severity scale with subject assigned 1 number: Intolerable behavior-frequently physically attacks others and destroys property (5); Severe-occasionally physically attacks people and destroys property (4); Moderately 21); and No aggressiveness reported (1). A minimum score of 1 is best and a maximum score of 5 is worst. There are no subscale scores.</description>

    <measure>Overt Aggression Scale-Modified (OAS-M)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OAS-M divides aggressions into 4 subtypes: 1) verbal aggression, 2) property aggression, 3) self aggression (autoaggression), and 4) physical aggression. Each subtype has an initial score ranging from 0 (least aggressive) to 4 (most aggressive). The score for each subscale is further weighed (multiplied) by a constant: verbal scale's constant is 1 (max adjusted score of 4); property scale's constant is 2 (max adjusted score 8); self scale's constant is 3 (max adjusted score 12); and physical scale's constant is 4 (max adjusted score of 16). Within a given scale, &quot;0&quot; is the best score and maximum adjusted scale score is worst.</description>

    <measure>Children's Aggression Scale-Parent Version</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAS-P is a 33 item scale representing 5 domains of aggression: Items in a domain were computed based on two reference points. The first was based on a 5 point frequency range with &quot;0&quot; being best (never) and &quot;4&quot; (&gt; 10 times being) worst. These same items were then adjusted such that more severe acts would be weighted more heavily compared to less severe aggressive behaviors. Within a domain, 0 was the best score. Worst score for the various aggression domains were: Verbal 26.16, Against Objects and Animals 11.8, Provoked 15.84, Initiated 17.84, and Use of Weapons 13.16.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Possible ratings are: 1. Normal, not at all ill; 2. Borderline mentally ill, 3. Mildly ill; 4. Moderately ill; 5. Markedly ill; 6. Severely ill; or 7. Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

          <title>Children's Aggression Scale-Parent Version</title>
          <description>CAS-P is a 33 item scale representing 5 domains of aggression: Items in a domain were computed based on two reference points. The first was based on a 5 point frequency range with &quot;0&quot; being best (never) and &quot;4&quot; (&gt; 10 times being) worst. These same items were then adjusted such that more severe acts would be weighted more heavily compared to less severe aggressive behaviors. Within a domain, 0 was the best score. Worst score for the various aggression domains were: Verbal 26.16, Against Objects and Animals 11.8, Provoked 15.84, Initiated 17.84, and Use of Weapons 13.16</description>

        <description>Rating of Aggression Against People and/or Property Scale (RAAPP) (Kemph et al 1993) is a global rating scale of aggression completed by clinicians. Score given based on following severity scale with subject assigned 1 number: Intolerable behavior-frequently physically attacks others and destroys property (5); Severe-occasionally physically attacks people and destroys property (4); Moderately 21); and No aggressiveness reported (1). A minimum score of 1 is best and a maximum score of 5 is worst. There are no subscale scores.</description>

            <description>The study was a 6-week open label study evaluating aripiprazole in the treatment of 10 male post-pubertal adolescents (13-17 years, Tanner Stage 4) diagnosed with conduct disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2000). The initial aripiprazole dose depending on the weight of the patient was: &lt; 25 kg = 1 mg/d; 25-50 kg = 2 mg/d; 50-70 kg = 5 mg/d; &gt; 70 kg = 10 mg/d (Data on File, 2003, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Thereafter the dose was individualized based on the response and tolerance to the drug with a maximum aripiprazole dose of 20 mg/d. Current psychotropic medications were not washed out of the patients at the beginning of the study due to the exploratory stage of use of the drug for the conduct disorder indication.</description>

        <description>OAS-M divides aggressions into 4 subtypes: 1) verbal aggression, 2) property aggression, 3) self aggression (autoaggression), and 4) physical aggression. Each subtype has an initial score ranging from 0 (least aggressive) to 4 (most aggressive). The score for each subscale is further weighed (multiplied) by a constant: verbal scale's constant is 1 (max adjusted score of 4); property scale's constant is 2 (max adjusted score 8); self scale's constant is 3 (max adjusted score 12); and physical scale's constant is 4 (max adjusted score of 16). Within a given scale, &quot;0&quot; is the best score and maximum adjusted scale score is worst.</description>
