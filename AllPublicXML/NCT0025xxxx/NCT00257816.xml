  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be approximately 14,000 new patients with invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in
      the United States in 2003 with about 4,000 deaths from this disease. This accounts for
      approximately 17% of all deaths due to gynecologic cancers. Radiation has been the primary
      treatment modality for locoregionally advanced cervical cancer. Recent trials of concomitant
      systemic cisplatin chemotherapy and radiation have shown high response rates (RR) with
      improvements in durable remissions and overall survival. Though the incidence and mortality
      in the U.S. dropped steadily from years 1940 to 2000, there has recently been a plateau,
      arresting the decline. With the routine addition of systemic Cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy to
      local regional radiation, mortality from advanced cervical cancer in the United States is
      expected to further decrease. However, further advances in this disease are needed.

      All eligible patients with invasive squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma
      of the cervix, Stages I-B2, II-B, III-B, and IV-A, will experience clinical staging as
      permitted by FIGO staging criteria.

      Primary Objective:

      Feasibility and toxicity of administering weekly Topotecan among patients with carcinoma of
      the cervix receiving concurrent pelvic radiation and Cisplatin.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      To assess the efficacy of administering weekly Topotecan to patients with carcinoma of the
      cervix receiving concurrent pelvic radiation and Cisplatin on:

        -  progression-free survival,

        -  overall survival, and

        -  local control

      Statistic This is a feasibility study. A two phase accrual will be utilized. If none or 1 of
      the 6 patients in the first Stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      then the second Stage of accrual (an additional 6 patients) will increase the Topotecan dose
      to 3 mg//m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and once during parametrial boost (6 cycles). If 2 or 3
      of the patients in the first stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      the dose of the Topotecan will remain the same in the second Phase of accrual. If 4 or more
      of the patients in the first stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      there will be no second phase of accrual.

    <description>Topotecan improves response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when added to cisplatin in treating metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer.
