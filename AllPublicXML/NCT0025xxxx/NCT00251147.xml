      This study compares standard open rotator cuff repair versus arthroscopic mini-open rotator
      cuff repair by measuring the disease-specific quality of life at 2 years in patients with
      full thickness rotator cuff tears.

      Hypothesis: There is no difference in disease-specific quality of life outcome at two years
      between open versus arthroscopic mini-open repair for patients with full-thickness rotator
      cuff tears.

    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff injury affects a diverse group of patients and leads to significant disability
      with respect to lost time from work and the inability to play sports, thereby affecting the
      individual's quality of life.

      The standard treatment for full-thickness rotator cuff repair is with an open acromioplasty
      procedure. An alternative procedure for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is with a combined
      procedure of arthroscopic acromioplasty and mini-open repair, which has the potential
      advantages of a preserved deltoid origin, lower perioperative morbidity, shorter hospital
      stays and less soft tissue dissection. The progression towards arthroscopic repair requires a
      comparison to the standard, open procedure for full-thickness rotator cuff tears, using
      validated outcomes in a randomized fashion.

      This study is designed as a multi-centre randomized controlled trial with a priori sample
      size calculation of 28 patients per group. Patients presenting with unremitting pain, failed
      conservative treatment of at least 3 months, weakness of the rotator cuff and positive
      imaging indicating a full-thickness rotator cuff tear are eligible for the study. Previous
      surgery on the affected shoulder and massive rotator cuff tears are excluded. Patients are
      randomized using computer-generated block randomization, stratified by surgeon, to either
      open or mini-open rotator cuff repair.

      Disease-specific quality of life is assessed using the validated Rotator Cuff Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, a self-administered, 34-item questionnaire designed specifically to assess
      patients before and after surgery. It utilizes a visual analog scale scored out of 100, with
      a higher score reflecting a better quality of life.

    <description>A standard vertical incision was made over the anterolateral aspect of the acromion. The deltoid muscle was split and stripped off the anterior aspect of the acromion. The anterior and inferior aspect of the acromion was removed. The coracoacromial ligament was excised. Repair of the tear in the cuff tendon(s) was accomplished by suturing leading edge of the tear into the greater tuberosity of the humerus at or near the original site of insertion of the cuff to bone. Trans-osseous sutures, suture anchors and tendon to tendon suture repair techniques were employed for a secure repair with the arm at the side. The surgeon was allowed to use whatever method(s) to create a secure repair. The deltoid was securely reattached to the acromion with the deltoid fascia repaired down the split.</description>

    <description>A standard arthroscopic gleno-humeral arthroscopy was performed followed by an arthroscopic acromioplasty. Three standard arthroscopic portals were used. The lateral portal was centered in line with the cuff tear, and incorporated into the mini-open incision. Initially, a partial bursectomy was performed to improve visualization. The inferior surface of the anterior acromion and the coracoacromial ligament were removed. Following the arthroscopic acromioplasty, a 3-4cm lateral incision was performed in the area of the lateral portal. The deltoid muscle was split longitudinally to expose the tear in the rotator cuff. The tear was repaired in a similar manner to the open repair with tendon to tendon sutures, trans-osseous sutures and with suture anchors.</description>
