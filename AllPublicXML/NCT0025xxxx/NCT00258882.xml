      To further characterize the vaccine safety profile and to identify any signals of potentially
      vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) not detected during pre-licensure studies.

      Surveillance using a healthcare organization with large comprehensive medical encounter
      databases will be used in this study to identify any risks or uncommon events associated with
      use of the recently licensed Adacel vaccine that may occur in routine clinical usage in a
      large population.

      No investigational vaccines will be administered in this study. Participants will be included
      in the study on the basis of their having received Adacel vaccine as part of routine care.

    <measure>Twenty One Pre-specified Outcomes of Interest as Obtained From International Coding of Diseases (ICD-9) Codes Captured After Adacel Vaccination in Clinical Database</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 to 60 and Day 61 to 120 following vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The twenty one pre-specified outcomes of special interest screened for in this study included: Arthritis, Arthralgia, or Arthropathy; Bell's Palsy; Diabetes; Encephalitis; Encephalopathy; Febrile Illness; Guillain-Barré; Hemolytic Anemia; Hypersensitivity; Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP); Lupus; Mixed Connective Tissue Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuralgia; Neuritis; Neuropathy; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Scleroderma; Seizure; Severe Local Reaction; Transverse Myelitis.
Comparison of events rates was performed using the risk-interval cohort design. In this design, the combined experience of individuals receiving Adacel vaccine served as their own control for evaluation of pre-specified outcomes of interest. Rates of events occurring during Days 0 to X (where X = 7, 14, 30, and 60) following vaccination were compared to rates of events occurring in the same individuals during Days 61 to 120 following vaccination.</description>

    <description>The twenty one pre-specified outcomes of special interest screened for in this study included: Arthritis, Arthralgia, or Arthropathy; Bell's Palsy; Diabetes; Encephalitis; Encephalopathy; Febrile Illness; Guillain-Barré; Hemolytic Anemia; Hypersensitivity; ITP; Lupus; Mixed Connective Tissue Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuralgia; Neuritis; Neuropathy; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Scleroderma; Seizure; Severe Local Reaction; Transverse Myelitis.
Comparison of events rates was performed using the historic cohort design in which screening for possible new-onset chronic illnesses during the first 6 months following vaccination was performed. For each age-subgroup event, rates during the 6 months following vaccination among persons receiving Adacel vaccine were compared to event rates during the 6 months following vaccination among persons in the same age subgroup who received Td vaccine, but no live virus vaccine, during the year prior to initiation of this study.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Maternal Outcomes in Pregnant Adacel Recipients and Pregnant Non-Adacel Recipient Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Pregnancy to Delivery, up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancies were identified by positive pregnancy tests or prenatal visits within 9 months prior to vaccination with no record of pre-vaccination delivery or abortion, or by prenatal visits, therapeutic abortions, or deliveries within 10 months after vaccination. For all such pregnancies, further review (including chart review, provider and vaccinee interviews, or other appropriate steps) was conducted to identify those for whom it could not be excluded that the individual was pregnant at the time of vaccination or within 28 days thereafter. Such pregnancies were reported by Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center to the Adacel Pregnancy Registry. Maternal and fetal outcomes (up to 1 month of life) were enumerated. For each pregnant Adacel vaccine subjects, 3 age-matched non-Adacel vaccinated controls (± 1 year) that had a first positive pregnancy test during the same month (± 1 month). Rates of events of maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.</description>

        <title>Twenty One Pre-specified Outcomes of Interest as Obtained From International Coding of Diseases (ICD-9) Codes Captured After Adacel Vaccination in Clinical Database</title>
        <description>The twenty one pre-specified outcomes of special interest screened for in this study included: Arthritis, Arthralgia, or Arthropathy; Bell's Palsy; Diabetes; Encephalitis; Encephalopathy; Febrile Illness; Guillain-Barré; Hemolytic Anemia; Hypersensitivity; Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP); Lupus; Mixed Connective Tissue Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuralgia; Neuritis; Neuropathy; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Scleroderma; Seizure; Severe Local Reaction; Transverse Myelitis.
Comparison of events rates was performed using the risk-interval cohort design. In this design, the combined experience of individuals receiving Adacel vaccine served as their own control for evaluation of pre-specified outcomes of interest. Rates of events occurring during Days 0 to X (where X = 7, 14, 30, and 60) following vaccination were compared to rates of events occurring in the same individuals during Days 61 to 120 following vaccination.</description>

Comparison of events rates was performed using the historic cohort design in which screening for possible new-onset chronic illnesses during the first 6 months following vaccination was performed. For each age-subgroup event, rates during the 6 months following vaccination among persons receiving Adacel vaccine were compared to event rates during the 6 months following vaccination among persons in the same age subgroup who received Td vaccine, but no live virus vaccine, during the year prior to initiation of this study.</description>

        <title>Summary of Maternal Outcomes in Pregnant Adacel Recipients and Pregnant Non-Adacel Recipient Controls</title>
        <description>Pregnancies were identified by positive pregnancy tests or prenatal visits within 9 months prior to vaccination with no record of pre-vaccination delivery or abortion, or by prenatal visits, therapeutic abortions, or deliveries within 10 months after vaccination. For all such pregnancies, further review (including chart review, provider and vaccinee interviews, or other appropriate steps) was conducted to identify those for whom it could not be excluded that the individual was pregnant at the time of vaccination or within 28 days thereafter. Such pregnancies were reported by Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center to the Adacel Pregnancy Registry. Maternal and fetal outcomes (up to 1 month of life) were enumerated. For each pregnant Adacel vaccine subjects, 3 age-matched non-Adacel vaccinated controls (± 1 year) that had a first positive pregnancy test during the same month (± 1 month). Rates of events of maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.</description>
