    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm study in patients with stage IIIB (with malignant pleural
      effusion) and IV NSCLC who have been previously treated with a platinum-based doublet.

      Each cycle will be 21 days. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive vinflunine 320
      mg/m2 as a 20-minute IV infusion.

      Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles for response using RECIST criteria.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:

          -  Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent.

          -  Patients must have recurrent or metastatic stage IIIB (with malignant pleural
             effusion) and IV NSCLC that has progressed after receiving a platinum-based doublet as
             first-line therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Previously irradiated lesions will not be allowed as
             measurable disease.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients must be &lt;18 years of age.

          -  Previous chemotherapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. Patients are considered not of
             child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are
             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures
             during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter.

          -  Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/uL, platelet count
             &gt;100,000/uL, and hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL.

          -  Patients must have a serum creatinine &lt;2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Patients must have a total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;5.0
             x ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following criteria will make the patient ineligible to participate in this
        study:

          -  Patients previously treated with vinflunine or another vinca alkaloid.

          -  Patients with untreated and clinically unstable brain metastases.

          -  Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled
             congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.

          -  Patients with a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness,
             including serious infection.

          -  Patient has a co-existing malignancy or had a malignancy diagnosed within the last 3
             years, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.

          -  Patient received treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days
             before planned start of study treatment.

          -  Patient is not completely healed from a previous oncologic or other major surgery.

          -  Patient is receiving or planning to receive any concurrent chemotherapy not indicated
             in the study protocol or an investigational agent during the study period.

          -  Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to vinflunine or any of the components
             in vinflunine or another vinca alkaloid.

          -  Any patient who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Any patient who is unable to comply with requirements of study.
