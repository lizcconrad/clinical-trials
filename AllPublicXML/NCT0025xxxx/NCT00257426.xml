      RATIONALE: Octreotide may stop or slow the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective
      treatment for liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well octreotide works in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To verify that long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will
           extend median survival from 5 months to 8.75 months in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with a CLIP score of 3 or more.

      Secondary

        -  To document tolerability of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to underlying degree of liver disease as defined
      by CLIP score classification.

      Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously three times daily on days 1-21 OR
      days 1-28. If the patient tolerates short-acting octreotide, the first dose of long-acting
      octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will be given intramuscularly beginning on day 8 OR day
      15. Treatment with long-acting octreotide repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Newly diagnosed or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as defined by tissue
             biopsy OR alpha fetoprotein (AFP) &gt; 1,000 ng/mL with compatible mass on CT scan or MRI

               -  Recurrence of previously resected HCC will not require tissue confirmation if
                  there is clear radiographic recurrence, in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Locally advanced OR metastatic disease

          -  Unmeasurable disease allowed if initial diagnosis was made according to the above
             criteria and/or recurrence has been confirmed by tissue biopsy or radiological imaging

          -  CLIP score ≥ 3

          -  Not a candidate for surgical resection or liver transplant

          -  Not a candidate for loco-regional therapy (e.g., ablation, embolization, hepatic
             arterial infusion therapy), but could have received such therapy in the past

          -  No fibrolamellar HCC

          -  No clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 8 weeks

          -  Karnofsky performance status 60-100%

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL

          -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 5.0 mg/dL

          -  AST or ALT ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Creatinine ≤ 2 times ULN

          -  PT ≤ 28

          -  INR ≤ 2.5

          -  No active variceal bleeding within the past 3 months

          -  No encephalopathy grade 3-4

          -  No ongoing ethanol or intravenous drug abuse

          -  Not pregnant or breast feeding

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  Any number of prior therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, resection, embolization, or
             radiofrequency/ethanol ablation therapy) allowed

          -  No concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy
