      Brief description: This 4-year research project will develop and test culturally and
      linguistically appropriate brief interventions to reduce barriers to health care for
      vulnerable children with persistent asthma.

      Background: The U.S. health system presents formidable challenges to the timely receipt of
      high quality care, especially for vulnerable children (e.g., those in families of color,
      lower SES, limited English ability). This population is at greatest risk for poor health
      outcomes. Children with asthma are an important vulnerable subgroup. Asthma, with an
      estimated prevalence of 6.9%, is the most common chronic condition in children. It is the
      most frequent reason for pediatric hospitalization and is a condition with documented
      disparities in care outcomes.

      A promising strategy for overcoming the barriers to quality care that these children
      encounter is the use of care coordinators who educate parents and children, connect the
      family with needed resources, and coordinate care from different settings. Care coordination
      has been shown effective in improving receipt of appropriate asthma services and health
      outcomes for children with asthma. Despite this evidence, there is concern that the effects
      of care coordination may not be maintained once these services end. This is particularly
      important given financial pressures to reduce the length and intensity of such services. In
      order to maintain the gains achieved during care coordination, families need to be able to
      identify and overcome barriers to care for and by themselves. This can be achieved through
      the use of Problem Solving Therapy, a documented behavioral method for teaching families the
      skills they need to resolve daily problems and improve adherence to medical regimens for
      children with chronic health conditions.

      Study Goals: The overall goal of this project is to improve the quality of care and health
      outcomes for vulnerable children with asthma. The specific aims of this two-phase project
      are:

        -  (Phase I) to adapt, in collaboration with community health workers and parents, existing
           materials to create two culturally and linguistically appropriate treatment manuals: a
           Care Coordination Treatment Manual that will standardize the delivery of culturally and
           linguistically appropriate home-based care coordination and asthma-specific education,
           and a Problem Solving Therapy Treatment Manual tailored to asthma that will include a
           detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing this approach to reduce barriers to care.

        -  (Phase II) to use the manuals developed in Phase I to perform a randomized controlled
           clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two brief interventions involving Care
           Coordination and tailored Problem Solving Therapy (tPST) in improving and maintaining
           improvement in health care quality and health-related quality of life for children with
           asthma.

      Evidence for the efficacy of tPST and the availability of culturally and linguistically
      appropriate treatment manuals should spur diffusion of this innovation to other practitioners
      and programs seeking evidence-based, optimal clinical management strategies.

      Methodology:

      Phase I. Existing materials for the Care Coordination and tPST manuals will be edited and/or
      rewritten to make them specific to asthma. Then both the manuals and the proposed
      interventions will be assessed for cultural acceptability though two series of parallel focus
      groups: one for parents of children with asthma, and the other for home visitors already
      providing care coordination for families of children with asthma. The revised educational
      materials will then be translated into Spanish.

      Phase II. Children ages 2-12 years with persistent asthma and their families (n = 366) will
      be randomized into two brief interventions:

        1. tPST (six sessions) plus Care Coordination (six home visits over 3 months) versus a Wait
           List control group (usual care) to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in
           improving outcomes 3 months after baseline.

        2. tPST versus Care Coordination and Wait List to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness
           in maintaining outcomes 9 months after baseline.

    <description>The PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales Total Scale Score (PedsQL™), which has been shown to be internally consistent, valid, and responsive to indicators of clinical change for children with asthma (Chan, Mangione-Smith, Burwinkle, Rosen, &amp; Varni, 2005; Seid et al., in press; Varni et al., 2004). The 23-item PedsQL™ asks respondents how often various issues have been a 'problem' in the past month, yields a score of 0 to 100 (higher scores are better), and includes parallel child self-report (ages 5-18 years) and parent proxy-report (ages 2-18 years) forms. We measured both self- and proxy-report, although our a priori primary outcome was parent proxy-report.</description>

The home visitors implemented a structured set of educational interventions, with written materials in English or Spanish, on the following topics: what is asthma, asthma medications and devices, asthma action plan, how to recognize and respond to symptom onset, and how to reduce irritants and allergens in the home. Home visitors referred families, when necessary, to existing health insurance enrollment assistance, smoking cessation, and other community support services. Home visitors communicated with the primary care provider via FAX, giving summaries of interventions, updates on progress, and noting family difficulties and needs (for example, needing equipment, prescriptions, or an (updated) asthma treatment plan).</description>

Participants are taught to approach problems proactively, define the problem, generate alternative solutions, choose the best, implement the solution, and evaluate how well that solution worked. Session 1 was devoted to rapport building, understanding the relevant social and medical situation, presenting an overview of the PST curriculum, and assigning the first homework - identifying a solvable problem. Session 2 reviewed prior homework, introduced the idea of developing alternative solutions, and assigned homework - defining and evaluating options. Session 3 reviewed homework, developed an action plan and assigned homework - implementing the action plan. Sessions 4-6 depended on the outcome of the actions, focusing on alternative plans if the results of the action plan were not satisfactory to the client or on additional problems if the results were satisfactory.</description>

        <description>The PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales Total Scale Score (PedsQL™), which has been shown to be internally consistent, valid, and responsive to indicators of clinical change for children with asthma (Chan, Mangione-Smith, Burwinkle, Rosen, &amp; Varni, 2005; Seid et al., in press; Varni et al., 2004). The 23-item PedsQL™ asks respondents how often various issues have been a ‘problem’ in the past month, yields a score of 0 to 100 (higher scores are better), and includes parallel child self-report (ages 5-18 years) and parent proxy-report (ages 2-18 years) forms. We measured both self- and proxy-report, although our a priori primary outcome was parent proxy-report.</description>

            <description>The 5-session (45-60 minutes, weekly) CC was based on NHLBI guidelines and the RWJF's Allies Against Asthma community health worker model (Friedman et al., 2006) and was delivered by two bachelor's level bilingual, bicultural asthma home visitors. The home visitors implemented a structured set of educational interventions, with written materials in English or Spanish, on the following topics: what is asthma, asthma medications and devices, asthma action plan, how to recognize and respond to symptom onset, and how to reduce irritants and allergens in the home. Home visitors referred families, when necessary, to existing health insurance enrollment assistance, smoking cessation, and other community support services. Home visitors communicated with the primary care provider via FAX, giving summaries of interventions, updates on progress, and noting family difficulties and needs (for example, needing equipment, prescriptions, or an (updated) asthma treatment plan).</description>

            <description>The CC+PST consisted of CC plus a 6-session (45-60 minutes, weekly) problem-solving skills training intervention. Participants are taught to approach problems proactively, define the problem, generate alternative solutions, choose the best, implement the solution, and evaluate how well that solution worked. Session 1 was devoted to rapport building, understanding the relevant social and medical situation, presenting an overview of the PST curriculum, and assigning the first homework - identifying a solvable problem. Session 2 reviewed prior homework, introduced the idea of developing alternative solutions, and assigned homework - defining and evaluating options. Session 3 reviewed homework, developed an action plan and assigned homework - implementing the action plan. Sessions 4-6 depended on the outcome of the actions, focusing on alternative plans if the results of the action plan were not satisfactory to the client or on additional problems if the results were satisfactory.</description>

            <description>The CC+PST consisted of CC plus a 6-session (45-60 minutes, weekly) problem-solving skills training intervention. Participants are taught to approach problems proactively, define the problem, generate alternative solutions, choose the best, implement the solution, and evaluate how well that solution worked. Session 1 was devoted to rapport building, understanding the relevant social and medical situation, presenting an overview of the PST curriculum, and assigning the first homework - identifying a solvable problem. Session 2 reviewed prior homework, introduced the idea of developing alternative solutions, and assigned homework - defining and evaluating options. Session 3 reviewed homework, developed an action plan and assigned homework - implementing the action plan. Sessions 4-6 depended on the outcome of the actions, focusing on alternative plans if the results of the action plan were not satisfactory to the client or on additional problems if the results were satisfactory.</description>

          <title>Asthma Symptoms</title>
          <description>Asthma symptom frequency was measured via the number of days and nights with asthma symptoms over the past two weeks. Night time asthma symptoms were converted to number of subjects experiencing night time asthma symptoms more than 1 time per week.</description>
          <population>All analyses were intent-to-treat and carried out according to a pre-established plan using SAS 9.1.3. All subjects with data at T2 or T3 were included in the analyses.</population>

          <title>Care Coordination</title>
          <description>The 5-session (45-60 minutes, weekly) CC was based on NHLBI guidelines and the RWJF's Allies Against Asthma community health worker model (Friedman et al., 2006) and was delivered by two bachelor's level bilingual, bicultural asthma home visitors. The home visitors implemented a structured set of educational interventions, with written materials in English or Spanish, on the following topics: what is asthma, asthma medications and devices, asthma action plan, how to recognize and respond to symptom onset, and how to reduce irritants and allergens in the home. Home visitors referred families, when necessary, to existing health insurance enrollment assistance, smoking cessation, and other community support services. Home visitors communicated with the primary care provider via FAX, giving summaries of interventions, updates on progress, and noting family difficulties and needs (for example, needing equipment, prescriptions, or an (updated) asthma treatment plan).</description>
