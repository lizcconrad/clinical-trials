  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether preventive home visits for healthy persons 75+, made by professional
      health workers, can change the pattern of care utilization and if the quality of life can
      improve. The hypothesis is that care utilisation will reduce, mortality decrease and quality
      of life improve.

      To investigate whether preventive home visits for healthy pensioners aged 75 years and over ,
      can change the pattern of care utilization and if the quality of life can improve. To
      investigate if the results will last after the intervention has come to an end.

      The concept of care utilization can in this trial be clarified as:

        -  use of primary health care

        -  use of elderly care including elderly houses

        -  mortality

        -  use of hospital care

      The concept of quality of life will in this trial be measured with a number of self
      judgements.

      The trial is performed as a randomized controlled trial in a small rural community in the
      north of Sweden. The staff is professional health workers and the visits is performed in the
      pensioners own homes.
