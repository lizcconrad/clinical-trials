  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase III study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of proposed
      dose conversion recommendations for RLS subjects converting from ropinirole immediate release
      to ropinirole controlled-release for RLS.

    <measure>Number of adverse events (AEs) post-conversion from ropinirole IR to ropinirole CR over period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. In each of the 6 cohorts, there were 2 conversions, one of which was IR to CR-RLS and the other one IR to IR. Two populations were defined: the first conversion population and the second conversion population. The first conversion population consisted of all participants receiving at least one dose of randomized drug during the pre-conversion 1 period and during the post-conversion 1 period. The second conversion population consisted of all participants receiving at least one dose of randomized drug during the pre-conversion 2 period and during the post-conversion 2 period.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. Onset of an AE was pre-Conversion 1 and discontinuation for the same AE occurred post-Conversion 1. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above.</description>

    <description>SAE is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. Severity was measured in terms of grades mild, moderate, and severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with positive scores (improved) on clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I) pre-conversion and one week post-conversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I) [Guy, 1976] allows the Investigator to rate the participants' global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at Baseline (Day 0), whether or not the change is thought to be due to treatment with study drug. The scale is rated from 1 to 7 (1=&quot;Very much improved&quot; to 7=&quot;Very much worse&quot;). Typically, a participant with a score of 1 were considered as &quot;Very much improved&quot; and 2 as &quot;Much improved&quot; responder. Positive response was given in terms of worsen to stable or stable to improved.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from pre-conversion in international RLS rating scale total score to one week post-conversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS Rating Scale was developed to measure disease severity for clinical assessment, research, and therapeutic studies an also to show relationship between responses and overall RLS severity. In addition, the IRLS Rating Scale was meant for post-hoc validation using the data from ropinirole IR earlier studies which validated the responsiveness of this scale. The IRLS Rating Scale is a disease-specific 10-item scale that is based on the IRLSSG consensus of clinical features and associated sleep problems. The investigator asked the participant to rate his/her symptoms for each of the ten questions contained in the IRLS Rating Scale from 0 to 4, with 0 representing the absence of a problem and 4 a very severe problem. Overall score was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with pre-and one week post-conversion orthostatic blood pressure values of potential clinical concern (PCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with pre- and post- conversion orthostatic systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values of PCC were summarized. Both conversions (drug and dummy) were considered. High and low values of only orthostatic SBP and DBP of PCC are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from pre-conversion in systolic and diastolic orthostatic SBP and DBP to one week post-conversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both conversions 1 and 2 (drug and dummy) were considered for analysis. High and low values of only orthostatic SBP and DBP of PCC are presented. Change from pre-conversion in BP is the value of BP at post-conversion minus the value at pre-conversion. For orthostatic changes (standing minus semi-supine vital signs values), pre-conversion measurements were compared with the post-conversion measurements. Positive values are indicative of less orthostatic decrease in blood pressure.</description>

    <measure>Change from pre-conversion in pulse rate to one week post-conversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both conversions 1 and 2 (drug and dummy) were considered for analysis. High and low values of only orthostatic pulse of PCC are presented. Change from pre-conversion in pulse rate is the value of pulse rate at post-conversion minus the value at pre-conversion. For orthostatic changes (standing minus semi-supine vital signs values), pre-conversion measurements were compared with the post-conversion measurements. Positive values are indicative of less orthostatic decrease in pulse.</description>
