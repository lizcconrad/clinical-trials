  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatologists are discussing, whether rehabilitation of patients with low back pain (LBP)
      can be improved. At present patients with LBP start treatment as soon as possible, this also
      applies for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) - pain lasting over 12 weeks. At
      Glostrup University Hospital department of Physical Medicine/rheumatology we use a method
      (method A) where an interdisciplinary team gives the patients a treatment composed of various
      topics. This includes among other things education, physical team training, exercises in
      swimming pool, stretching exercises, and occupational therapy. A different method (method B)
      originates from the Rehabilitation centre in Karlslunde led by Teddy Oefeldt. Here they focus
      strictly on dynamic training of muscles in the back and the buttocks. A therapist, who in the
      beginning partly carries the patient through the exercises, assists this training.

      In both methods, individually considerations are taken, but to a greater extend in method B.
      The treatment will extend over a three months period.

      A few earlier investigations have compared these two methods, but they have not been
      systematized to such a degree, that they gave any final conclusions. Therefore, we
      initialized an investigation including a larger number of patients, where the two methods are
      compared from the results the patients achieve after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

      286 consecutive patients were included and randomized to one of the two methods. Those, who
      did not wish to participate in the investigation, were treated according to the departmentâ€™s
      normal procedure (Method A)
