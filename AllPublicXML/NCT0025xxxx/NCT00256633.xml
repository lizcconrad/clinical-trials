      TITLE: CSP 465-C, Fatty Acid Binding protein 2 (FABP2) ancillary proposal to CSP# 465
      Glycemic Control and Complications in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.

      Angeliki Georgopoulos, M.D. Carlos Abraira M.D. William Duckworth M.D.

      Fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) is involved in the transport of long chain fatty acids
      across the intestinal epithelium. A common (40-45%) polymorphism of FABP2 gene (codon 54
      Threonine for Alanine) results in increased intestinal fatty acid absorption and triglyceride
      secretion (Baier et al J Clin Invest 95:1281-87, 1995; Baier et al J Biol Chem 271:
      10892-10896,1996). We have found (JCEM 85:3155-60, 2000) that in patients with type 2
      diabetes, the codon 54 polymorphism of the FABP2 results in fasting and postprandial
      hypertriglyceridemia. Since hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis in type
      2 diabetes and it is part of the insulin resistance syndrome, the objective of this ancillary
      study would be to screen the participants of the CSP# 465 study for the polymorphism and
      assess a) whether those carrying the polymorphism respond differently to the various
      treatment modalities and b) whether they develop more cardiovascular events compared to the
      ones lacking the polymorphism. There is one study that suggests an association of the
      polymorphism with a history of parental stroke (JCEM 85:2801-4, 2000).

      The only additional request from the study participants will be to agree to the collection of
      a blood sample to be used for DNA isolation and screening for the polymorphism. No additional
      funds are requested. If this polymorphism proves to be a predictor of either the response to
      a specific treatment modality or of the risk to macro-vascular complications, it will be very
      easy to screen for it and target our treatment modalities appropriately.

      The data was not analyzed therefore there will be no results for this record/study.
