      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of lapaquistat acetate, once daily
      (QD), taken with established lipid-lowering therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a recognized cause of secondary dyslipidemia, and is also independently
      considered to be a major cardiovascular risk factor requiring aggressive lipid-lowering
      treatment. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85% to 90% of diabetes worldwide. It affects about 2%
      of the Caucasian population in most Westernized countries, and the prevalence rises with age
      to 10% in those over 70 years of age. Five percent or more of young- and middle-aged adults
      in some Asian or Afro-Caribbean groups in the United Kingdom have this condition.
      Approximately 12 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and an estimated 20 million more
      have some degree of glucose intolerance. The greatest cause of mortality in type 2 diabetes
      is atherosclerotic vascular disease and its sequelae between 75% and 80% of adult subjects
      with diabetes die of macrovascular complications.

      Lapaquistat acetate is a squalene synthase inhibitor currently under development at Takeda
      for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      lapaquistat acetate co-administered with an established lipid-lowering therapy including
      atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fenofibrate in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
