      Hypothesis: Schizotypal personality disorder patients will show cognitive improvements in 1)
      working memory 2) learning and memory 3) sustained attention 4) enhanced performance on the
      AX-CPT, N-back and Eriksen during pergolide treatment. There will be a significant diagnosis
      by drug administration of 0.3 mg of oral pergolide interaction for performance on the
      cognitive tasks, with the schizotypal personality disorder group demonstrating significantly
      improved peformance compared to the other personality disorder group after pergolide compared
      with placebo.

      Design: Randomized, double-blind, crossover study of pergolide vs. placebo. Half of subjects
      receive pergolide for eight weeks; half of subjects receive placebo for four weeks followed
      by pergolide for four weeks.
