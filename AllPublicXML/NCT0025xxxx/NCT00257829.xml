      The Phenomenon of Tumor Hypoxia Many solid tumors are relatively resistant to treatment with
      ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines that are
      affected adversely by acidic pH. These effects have primarily been attributed to the presence
      of hypoxic cells within the tumor. The relevance of hypoxia with respect to failure of
      radiotherapy to cure certain malignancies has had a chequered history. However, in recent
      years the evidence that hypoxia plays a central role in relative radioresistance has become
      more compelling.

      Since approximately two-thirds of all women suffering from cervical carcinoma receive
      radiation as a component of their therapy, an enhanced understanding of the interactions
      between hypoxia and radiation as a component of their therapy, an enhanced understanding of
      the interactions between hypoxia and radiation resistance is critical to improving outcome
      among those with cervical cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject will have a malignant tumor of the cervix which is not curable by surgery
             in which it has been determined the subject is to receive the standard care of
             treatment of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

          -  The subject must have adequate bone marrow function, renal function, hepatic function
             and neurologic function.

          -  The subject should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics.

          -  The subject must have signed the approved informed consent

          -  If the subject is of childbearing age, they must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             with effective contraception

          -  The subject must have met pre-entry requirements

               1. Physical examination to include pelvic examination, blood counts, assessment of
                  liver and kidney status through blood studies

               2. A serum pregnancy test

               3. Detectable tumor will be measured.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has not been clinically staged for their cancer

          -  The subject has evidence of or is being treated for an active infection

          -  The subject cannot perform the appropriate follow-up or complete the study for
             whatever reason.

          -  The subject has not consented to an additional tumor biopsy and MRI after my seven
             days of treatment with methazolamide

          -  The subject has evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  The subject is currently breastfeeding

          -  The subject is pregnant

          -  The subject takes aspirin chronically
