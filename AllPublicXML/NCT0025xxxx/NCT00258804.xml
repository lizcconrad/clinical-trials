      Primary Objectives :

        -  To compare the number of hypoglycaemic events (severe, symptomatic, asymptomatic,
           nocturnal) in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin glargine (Lantus®) and
           glimepiride (Amaryl®), before, during and after the period of fasting in Ramadan.

      Secondary Objectives :

        -  To assess glycaemic control before, during and after Ramadan in terms of HbA1c, FBG, and
           8-point blood glucose profile (FBG and 8-point blood glucose profile will be collected
           with a blood glucose monitor through a monthly patient diary).

        -  To assess the relationship between hypoglycaemia events during Ramadan and blood glucose
           control prior and during Ramadan.

        -  To assess patient satisfaction

        -  To document adverse events (all serious adverse events, non serious adverse events)
           throughout the study (all events will be collected through the monthly patient diary).
