      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        1. Inter-site variability in CIMT image measurement using SonoCalcTM.

        2. If non-sonographer health care professionals working in an office practice setting can
           be trained to follow a carotid scanning protocol that permits (a) accurate measurement
           of CIMT and (b) determination of plaque presence.

        3. If (a) CIMT measurements and (b) determination of plaque presence by non-sonographer
           health care professionals are bioequivalent to those made by a core laboratory.

        4. If CIMT measurements and plaque assessment performed in office practices lead to
           meaningful changes in patient and physician behavior related to cardiovascular disease
           prevention.
