  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Study is to determine the prophylactic effects of CVT-E002 treatment for
      upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adult employees working with residents in
      continuing care facilities. It is hypothesized that the use of CVT-E002 will effectively
      reduce the incidence, severity and duration of upper respiratory infections among the
      participants when compared to placebo.

      Eligible continuing care employees will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or
      placebo group with equal numbers in each group. The treatment will consist of taking two
      capsules of CVT-E002 (400mg)or placebo every morning, after breakfast, for a period of 12
      weeks. The subjects will be given an assessment form to log specific symptoms on a daily
      basis if they get a cold.

      Symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, hoarseness, cough, earaches, and
      fever. Subjects will be required to maintain the same dosing even during an upper respiratory
      infection and will be requested not to take any additional medication for their upper
      respiratory infection unless prescribed by their family physicians.
