  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of postnatal depression
      screening by comparing the mental health outcome (at 6 months postpartum) of mothers under
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) screening programme versus usual clinical
      practice (usual practice), using randomized controlled trial design. With the use of the EPDS
      for the screening of postnatal depression, it is expected that more mothers in need of
      intervention (including mental health intervention, guidance in childcare and parenting,
      counseling in family relationships, etc) will be picked up and offered appropriate
      intervention, compared to the usual practice. It is hypothesized that the mental health of
      the group of women under the EPDS screening programme will be better than those under the
      usual practice, on subsequent follow-up.
