  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with relapsed
      or refractory multiple myeloma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (confirmed CR, R and PR) in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

      III. To assess overall and progression-free survival in this group of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      IV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, associations between gene expression signatures and
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
