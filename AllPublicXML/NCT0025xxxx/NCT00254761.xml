      To determine if smoking marijuana will reduce neuropathic pain without causing too much
      drowsiness or feeling &quot;too dopey&quot;.

      The case for marijuana's medical use for pain is primarily from experimental studies with
      normal subjects, which have yielded conflicting results. Experimental subjects have been
      shown to have significant dose-dependant antinociception effect that is not reversed by
      opioid antagonism. In contrast to this positive antinociceptive effect, other experiments
      demonstrated hyperalgesic activity and probably enhancement of the perception of pain upon
      acute exposure in chronic users of marijuana.

      In addition to studying spontaneous pain antinociception, it would be useful to evaluate the
      response to marijuana following evoked pain. Such evoked pain is produced by stimulation of
      the skin that is normally not noxious.

      Because of the potential side effects of marijuana administration, one of the aims of the
      present study is to analyze inter-individual variability and the occurrence of dose-dependant
      analgesia of marijuana with an eye on defining tolerable dosing in clinical neuropathic pain
      syndromes.

      Comparisons: Neuropathic and experimentally induced pain scores will be compared after the
      administration of escalating doses of low, high, and placebo marijuana cigarettes as provided
      by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
