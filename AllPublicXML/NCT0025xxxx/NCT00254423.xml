  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-354825 (dasatinib) can help to
      control CML in chronic phase. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Dasatinib is an anticancer drug that is designed to block the function of BCR-ABL, which is
      the abnormal protein responsible for causing leukemia in certain cells.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you agree, you will take
      dasatinib once every day while on study. Dasatinib should be taken by mouth with water.

      Every 1-2 weeks during the first 4 weeks of the study, you will have around 2 tablespoons of
      blood drawn for routine blood tests. The blood tests will be repeated every 4-6 weeks until 1
      year from when you started therapy and then every 3-4 months until 2 years, then as often as
      the doctor thinks it is needed. A bone marrow aspiration will also be taken to check the
      status of the disease every 3-4 months for the first year and then as often as the doctor
      thinks it is needed for as long as you are on the study.

      You will be given a medication diary to monitor any missed doses. You will also be asked to
      visit the doctor for a physical exam and to have vital signs measured periodically. These
      visits will be scheduled at least every 3-4 months for the first year, then recommended every
      6 to 12 months while you are on the study. The visits may be scheduled more often depending
      on the status of the disease.

      Treatment may be continued for up to 15-18 years or as long as the doctor feels it is
      necessary to control the leukemia. If the disease gets worse or you experience any
      intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the study and your doctor will discuss other
      treatment options with you. If you decide to stop participating in the study, you are
      encouraged to discuss your decision with your study doctor.

      For Patients Already Enrolled:

      If you have already been enrolled on this study and were assigned to receive dasatinib twice
      a day, you will be able to continue to receive the study drug on that schedule. However, if
      you experience side effects, the study doctor may choose to switch you to the once daily
      schedule if he feels that it may help to get rid of or decrease the risk of side effects.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is investigational and is approved by the FDA for
      clinical trials only.

      A total of 150 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Ph-positive or Bcr-Abl positive CML in early chronic phase CML (i.e.,
             time from diagnosis &lt;/= 12 months). Except for hydroxyurea, patients must have
             received no or minimal prior therapy, defined as &lt;1 month (30 days) of prior IFN-alpha
             (with or without ara-C) and/or an FDA approved TKI

          2. Continued from above #1: Clonal evolution defined as the presence of additional
             chromosomal abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome has been historically been
             included as a criterion for accelerated phase. However, patients with clonal evolution
             as the only criterion of accelerated phase have a significantly better prognosis, and
             when present at diagnosis may not impact the prognosis at all. Thus, patients with
             clonal evolution and no other criteria for accelerated phase will be eligible for this
             study

          3. Age &gt;/= 16 years (Age &gt;18 years to participate in optional symptom burden assessment)

             SGPT &lt;2.5x ULN, creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN

          6. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study, in keeping with the policies of the hospital.

          7. Reliable telephone access to receive calls from an interactive voice response system
             (IVR) (only applicable to patients who will participate in optional symptom burden
             assessment)

             pointes); Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt; 450 msec) on both
             the Fridericia and Bazett's correction; Uncontrolled hypertension; History of
             significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including:

          4. Patients with active, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders including: psychosis, major
             depression, and bipolar disorders

          5. Women of pregnancy potential must practice 2 effective methods of birth control during
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized.Prior to
             study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.

             investigational product. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not
             receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in the study.

          7. Patients in late chronic phase (i.e., time from diagnosis to treatment &gt;12 months),
             accelerated or blast phase are excluded.

          8. The definitions of CML phases are as follows: a) Early chronic phase: time from
             diagnosis to therapy &lt;/= 12 months; Late chronic phase: time from diagnosis to therapy
             &gt; 12 months, b) Blastic phase: presence of 30% blasts or more in the peripheral blood
             or bone marrow, c) Accelerated phase CML: presence of any of the following features:
             •Peripheral or marrow blasts 15% or more, •Peripheral or marrow basophils 20% or more,
             •Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 10^9/L unrelated to therapy, • Documented extramedullary
