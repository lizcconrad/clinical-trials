  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful bladder syndrome (PBS)/interstitial cystitis (IC) may be due to the actions of nitric
      oxide (NO) in the bladder tissue. NO is a gaseous substance with a very short half-life,
      synthesized by a group of NO-synthase-enzymes in many tissues.

      The goal of this study is to illuminate bladder tissue production of NO in individuals with
      PBS and healthy individuals, by quantification of NO and NO-enzyme expression by different
      molecular biological methods.
