  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of chemotherapy and radiation is often used to treat rectal cancer patients
      before surgery in an effort to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove as well as to
      help increase the chances of sphincter-sparing surgery. Many previous clinical studies have
      suggested that rectal cancer patients may survive longer if the surgery results in a
      pathological complete response - that is, the absence of any tumor cells in the surgical
      specimen. However, there is still controversy over this. This study attempts to start to
      answer this question by treating rectal cancer patients with a combination of chemotherapy
      drugs (oxaliplatin and capecitabine), a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme inhibitor and
      radiation before surgery. The rates of pathologic complete response, sphincter-sparing
      surgery, and disease-free survival are some of the therapeutic endpoints that will be
      studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improved regional control as demonstrated by a lower incidence of local recurrence after
      concurrent chemoradiation delivered either pre-operatively or post-operatively for resectable
      rectal cancer is supported by clinical trial data but the impact on overall survival with
      either approach remains controversial. An ideal regimen for preoperative chemoradiation in
      locally advanced rectal cancer would include agents that are both potent radio-sensitizers
      and effective in treating micro-metastatic disease without excessive toxicity. The
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is over expressed in colorectal cancer, but the exact role of
      this over expression in tumorigenesis remains an active area of research. The area with the
      most potential in using cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in cancer treatment may be to use them as
      an adjunct to other modalities of treatment.

      Taking into consideration all the above, a previous pilot trial of neoadjuvant therapy with
      combined oxaliplatin, capecitabine, celecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor), and radiation was
      conducted in four patients with operable rectal cancer. Promising results, including pain
      relief and downstaging of cancer, were observed.

      Therefore, this single-arm phase II trial of preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for
      patients with T3-4N0-2M0 rectal cancer was initiated to assess patient outcomes and explore
      the relationship between COX-2 expression in surgical specimens and therapeutic endpoints.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the grading system (0-5) NCI CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 3.0.
Toxicity will be reported as the proportion of subjects experiencing Grades 3,4, and 5 adverse events (AEs) out of all evaluable patients</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Version 1.0) will be used to determine tumor response and progression. Progressive disease (PD) for target lesions: &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study, and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered . PD for non-target lesions is defined as unequivocal appearance of one or more new malignant lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Time to progression will be measured from the time of surgery or clinically documented down staging if surgery for whatever reason is not carried in the subject until there is evidence of PD.
Progression-free survival is reported as the percentage of patients who have not experienced progression of disease at three years post-surgery</description>

The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered . PD for non-target lesions is defined as unequivocal appearance of one or more new malignant lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Time to progression will be measured from the time of surgery or clinically documented down staging if surgery for whatever reason is not carried in the subject until there is evidence of PD.
Progression-free survival is reported as the percentage of patients who have not experienced progression of disease at three years post-surgery</description>
