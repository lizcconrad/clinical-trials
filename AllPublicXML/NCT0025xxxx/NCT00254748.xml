  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with schizophrenia, 'atypical' antipsychotics such as clozapine may be effective
      in the treatment of psychosis. In patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), as far
      as the investigators know, no well designed controlled studies have been performed on the
      effect of one of the newer atypical antipsychotics on psychotic symptoms.

      It is of interest to investigate the benefit of quetiapine treatment in these types of
      patients. Quetiapine possibly gives less side-effects because of the expected lack of
      elevated prolactin levels, which is of importance in this patient group, overrepresented by
      young females. In this double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, 8 week, parallel group,
      multi-center study, quetiapine (in flexible doses between 200 mg/day and 600 mg/day) will be
      compared with the placebo.
