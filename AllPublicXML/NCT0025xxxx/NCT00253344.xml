      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      lenalidomide together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when
      given together with docetaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when
           given in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-14 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
