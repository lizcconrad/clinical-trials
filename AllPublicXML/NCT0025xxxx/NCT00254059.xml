  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at an alternative new pathway for diagnosis and treatment based on
      simple procedures in the patient’s own home compared with the current conventional laboratory
      based pathway. The purpose is to determine whether all patients with OSA require the more
      elaborate laboratory procedures, or whether a subgroup can be managed more simply.

      The research question we are exploring is whether the conventional approach is better in
      terms of successful treatment, compliance with treatment, and quality of life. There will be
      2 arms to the study. Subject will be randomly assigned to either one of the following two
      treatment options: 1) the conventional investigation and nasal CPAP treatment pathway
      comprising 2 overnight sleep studies, one for diagnosis and one for determining the required
      level of nasal CPAP treatment 2) experimental pathway that uses a simplified home study
      (overnight oximetry), together with a machine that automatically adjusts the nasal CPAP
      pressure to the required amount, and a careful follow-up during the first 2 weeks of
      treatment.

      Procedures: The study protocol will require the subject to complete the following procedures
      which are part of routine clinical practice: History and Physical Examination by a physician,
      Home Oximetry (This simple test involves wearing an oxygen probe gently wrapped around
      subject’s finger during a night’s sleep to continuously measure the amount of oxygen in blood
      and detect obstructions of subject’s breathing. The probe is easily applied by the subject
      and requires no supervision), Spirometry (simple non-invasive breathing test), Standardized
      Sleepiness Questionnaires, Orientation and Education regarding nasal CPAP therapy, and
      compliance monitoring, Overnight polysomnography (This is the procedure that requires subject
      to spend a night in the sleep laboratory with a variety of painless and non-invasive
      monitoring devices attached to the body. The purpose is to obtain detailed information about
      subject’s sleep quality, breathing, heart function, and body movements during sleep. Subject
      will be continuously monitored by a trained technologist during this procedure.). The
      following procedures are not routine and subject may be required to complete some or all of
      them depending on which pathway assigned to. Follow-up visits to the Clinic on Days 7 and 14
      of nasal CPAP treatment for adjustments of nasal CPAP pressure as required (this could also
      be done at home), Repeat Home Oximetry as required, Quality of Life Questionnaire.
