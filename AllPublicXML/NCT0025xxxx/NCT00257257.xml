      The total duration of the study will be up to 6 and 1/2 months including screening period (up
      to 14 days) and double-blind treatment period (approximately 6 months) in patients on mild

               -  short-term (less than or equal to 1 month) use to maintain glycemic control for
                  hospitalization, medical procedures, or intervention.

          -  b) use of an oral antidiabetic agent is accepted if it is not within 6 months prior to
             screening visit and only if it was prescribed for no more than 4 months.

          -  HbA1C greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%.

        Related to endocrine and metabolic disorders:

          -  Presence of any clinically significant endocrine disease according to the

        is stable for at least 3 months prior to screening visit.

          -  Fasting C-peptide &lt; 1.0 ng/mL.

        Related to other disorders:

          -  Presence of any severe medical or psychological condition that in the opinion of the
