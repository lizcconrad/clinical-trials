      1.0 OBJECTIVES 1.1 To test the activity of arsenic trioxide in combination with imatinib in
      patients with CML with cytogenetic evidence of residual disease.

      1.2 To determine the toxicity associated with this therapy.

      -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from the clonal expansion of immature myeloid
           cells with the t (9,22) (Ph) translocation, that encodes the constitutively active
           tyrosine kinase oncogene, bcr/abl. Patients with chronic phase CML are currently being
           treated with either hemopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or with the recently
           approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Previous data, using interferon in
           patients with CML, has shown that patients who do not achieve a major cytogenetic
           response (defined as &gt;35% Ph+) have a shortened survival. These patients are often
           considered for HSCT. However, due to constraints of age, suitable donor, and patient
           choice, only a minority of patients will undergo this potentially curative procedure.

        -  The aim of this study is to create a uniform approach to the treatment of CML in New
           Mexico, with an aim of achieving complete cytogenetic response as the primary goal. A
           graded approach will be taken, starting out with the standard treatment (imatinib 400 mg
           per day), and then in patients identified as poor responders an imatinib, and arsenic
           combination will be offered to patients. It is hoped to find a complete cytogenetic
           response that exceeds the ~20% response with gleevec 800mg per day.

    <description>Pts. who fit the inclusion criteria, &amp; were on imatinib, 400 mg/day, will be treated with a month of imatinib at 800 mg/d in divided doses (400mg bid) &amp; then started on arsenic trioxide. Pts. already on imatinib 800 mg/day may be started on arsenic trioxide. Pts. unable to tolerate 800 mg/d should be treated at the max. dose tolerated above 400 mg/d. A total of 16 weeks of arsenic trioxide treatment will be administered (15 weeks of maintenance). Pts. are to continue on imatinib 800 mg/day,(or the max. tolerated dose) while receiving the arsenic trioxide. If a pt. has been taken off the arsenic trioxide, they should be continued on gleevec 800 mg per day (or the maximum tolerated dose) until there is evidence of progression of disease.</description>
