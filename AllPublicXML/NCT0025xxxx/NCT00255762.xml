  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with
      bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving carboplatin and paclitaxel
      together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the anti-tumor activity of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
      bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with unresectable stage IV
      melanoma.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary I. Determine the distribution of overall survival times in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the
      changes in blood levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      IV. Determine the changes in immune homeostasis in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, and 15, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
