    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine drinking behavior and decision-making while taking
      Naltrexone and placebo. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover
      study. There are two cycles: one cycle on Naltrexone and one cycle on placebo.

      The study proposed is a 22 to 23 day, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 60
      male and female moderate to heavy alcohol users who are Asp40 positive and negative. Subjects
      will undergo a 6 to 7-day cycle taking the first study drug (naltrexone or placebo) with an
      alcohol self-administration visit in the laboratory bar on the 6th or 7th day of drug. The
      first alcohol self-administration visit is followed by an 8 to 9 day washout period. Subjects
      then cross over to repeat the cycle while taking the other drug (placebo or naltrexone). On
      the final day (either day 8 or 9) of the first study drug cycle, the subject will undergo
      functional imaging (fMRI) at the WBIC. There will be at least one day in between the 'lab
      bar' and the fMRI scan. The first fMRI visit is followed by a 5-6 day washout period.
      Subjects then cross over to repeat the cycle while taking the other drug (placebo or
      naltrexone). Subjects will keep daily diaries of alcohol and medication use throughout the
      study.
