  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)is a non invasive technique which uses a very
      weak current to change excitability in targeted regions of the brain. Early studies suggest
      that it has antidepressant properties. This study will test the safety and efficacy of tDCS
      as a treatment for depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applies a weak direct current across the scalp
      that can produce sub-threshold changes in the excitability of targeted cortical regions, in a
      polarity-specific manner. This technique has been used in humans to alter motor and visual
      cortex excitability, during stimulation, and for a period after the stimulation has ceased.
      It has therefore been suggested as a possible treatment for depression (Lippold &amp; Redfearn,
      1964; Nitsche, 2002). Studies have been launched recently to examine the effect of tDCS in
      depressed subjects and a sham-controlled pilot study (in USA, in press) has reported
      promising antidepressant effects with tDCS.

      We wish to examine this in an investigation of 20 subjects, and hypothesise that tDCS will
      have an antidepressant effect and produce no neuropsychological impairment. Subjects will
      receive anodal DC stimulation or sham stimulation over the left prefrontal cortex in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled design over 5 days, and then have daily stimulation up to a
      maximum of 10 active sessions in total. Outcomes will be formally evaluated by depression
      rating scales and neuropsychological tests.
