      The purposes of this study are the following:

        1. To further characterize and quantify both CSF-1 and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor
           (CSF-1R) expression from additional tumor specimens, specifically, tumors of high grade
           and from metastatic sites.

        2. To assay using Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) sandwich monoclonal antibody
           methodology, CSF-1 expression in the peritoneal fluid and blood from patients with
           endometrial adenocarcinomas.

        3. Using immunohistochemistry, to evaluate the presence of staining for CSF-1 and CSF-1R
           from additional patients with endometrial adenocarcinomas, especially of high grades and
           from metastatic sites.

        4. To determine the extent of cytokine, specifically CSF-1, but also interleukin-1 (IL-1),
           IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), production, in
           endometrial carcinoma cells in primary cell culture.

        5. To determine the responsiveness of epithelial cells on estrogen and antiestrogen
           binding, to determine if CSF-1 production is mediated, in these cells, by estrogen
           receptor binding, or alternative pathways of intracellular/cell-cell signal
           transduction.

        6. The ultimate objective of these experiments is to characterize CSF-1 expression from
           benign and tumor cells in order to identify steps in the CSF-1 activated signalling
           pathways that may represent potential targets for therapy.

      These experiments, taken together, should critically determine if there is a role for the
      CSF-1/ c-fms autocrine, endocrine, or paracrine loop in the progression of endometrial
      adenocarcinoma. If so, alterations in this loop may provide novel medical therapies for this
      disease. Additionally, these experiments will determine which are the predominant cytokines
      expressed in these tumors, and will help the investigators to determine the role, if any,
      these cytokines play in cancer cell growth and proliferation in relationship with each other
      and within and outside of the estrogen-mediated pathways.

      We have collected serum and ascites from approximately 200 patients with endometrial
      carcinoma and 200 controls. We have long term follow-up serum from approximately 60 of these
      patients. Approximately 10% of endometrial carcinoma patients recur. Our goal will be to
      eventually have follow-up serum from up to 60 patients with recurrent endometrial carcinoma
      in our tissue bank, so that we can determine the role of these assays in predicting
      recurrence.
