  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 52-week, multicenter, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) extended-release tablets (metoprolol
      CR/XL) in hypertensive pediatric subjects. The study population included school age children
      (age 6 to 12 years &lt; Tanner Stage 3) and adolescents (&gt; 12 years old or &gt; Tanner Stage 3 to
      16 years old) of both genders. Because response to some therapies in adult hypertension
      appears to be different in black and non-black populations, the recruitment will have a
      mixture of black and non-black subjects. Pharmacokinetic measurements were performed on a
      subset of patients. Thirty subjects (15 subjects each in the 6 to 12 year age group and the
      13 to 16 year age group) had a series of blood samples drawn. All subjects had a trough
      plasma level taken 24 hours after the last dose of open-label metoprolol CR/XL (Visit 18)
      with the exception of those subjects who completed Protocol 307B (16 week open-label
      treatment).

               1. Have successfully completed Protocol 307A, or, or

               2. Have dropped out of Protocol 307A or failed screening for Protocol 307A for
                  sitting SBP/DBP greater than 20/10 mm Hg over the 95 th percentile using height
                  adjusted charts for age and gender (see Appendices B through E inclusive), or

               3. Have not enrolled in Protocol 307A but meet all screening criteria for Protocol
                  307B and are enrolled at sites that have already randomized 6 subjects into
                  Protocol 307A.
