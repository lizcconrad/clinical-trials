      This study compares outcomes and metal ion levels between patients who receive the Conserve®
      Plus Hip System compared to those who have received a standard hip replacement in a recent
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently the standard of care for end-stage degenerative
      joint disease of the hip. In this surgery, the entire joint is replaced by inserting an
      acetabular component into the pelvis, a femoral stem down the thigh bone (which has a ball on
      it to articulate in the acetabulum). However for the younger patient, long-term fixation and
      the prospect of multiple revisions remain a notable concern. Long-term results of THA in this
      patient population have been disappointing. Studies cite failure rates of 21% to 33% at less
      than 10 years follow up. The Conserve Plus Hip System differs from total hip arthroplasty as
      it uses less bone stock from the femoral bone. The prosthesis is designed so that the head of
      the femoral bone is resurfaced rather than replaced. Consequently, bone stock of the femur is
      conserved. The bone conserving nature of this implant allows the surgeon to convert to a
      total hip arthroplasty with ease should a time arise when the patient requires revision
      arthroplasty. The Conserve Plus Hip System is also different from the THA as the bearing
      surface is metal on metal, rather than the conventional metal on polyethylene. This metal on
      metal bearing surface provides lower wear. Theoretically, this type of hip replacement may be
      a viable alternative to THA for the younger patient.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patients who are undergoing primary hip surgery for noninflammatory degenerative joint
        disease (NIDJD). Composite diagnoses for NIDJD include osteo/degenerative arthritis,
        traumatic arthritis, congenital hip dysplasia, and avascular necrosis.2. Patients who are
        skeletally mature or at least 18 years of age.3. Patients for whom there is a reasonable
        expectation that they will be available for each examination scheduled over a two year
        post-operative follow up period and for annual exams until the last patient entered into
        the study has achieved two years of follow-up.4. Patients who agree to participate and sign
        the informed consent form.5. Patients who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.6.
        Patients who are already enrolled in the study and present with a need for revision of the
        metal femoral or acetabular resurfacing components. These patients may have the failed
        component(s) revised with an investigational component.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  . Patients who are less than 18 years of age or are skeletally immature at the time of
             surgery.2. Patients who present with inflammatory degenerative joint disease or
             revision surgery other than that specified in the inclusion criteria.3. Patients with
             previous fusions, acute femoral neck fractures and above knee amputations.4. Patients
             with evidence of active infection.5. Patients who are pregnant (or plan on becoming
             pregnant) or who are lactating.6. Patients with neurologic or musculoskeletal disease
             that may adversely affect gait or weight bearing.7. Patients who have previously
             undergone an ipsilateral hemi resurfacing, total resurfacing, total bipolar, unipolar,
             or total hip replacement device.8. Patients with active hepatitis or HIV infection.9.
             Patients who otherwise meet the study criteria, but refuse to consent in writing to
             participate in the study. 10. Patients who are obese where obesity is defined as a
             Body Mass Index (BMI) &amp;gt;35.11. Patients with neuropathic joints.12. Patients with
             severe documented psychiatric disease.13. Patients requiring structural bone
             grafts.14. Patients with a documented allergy to cobalt chromium molybdenum.15.
             Patients with ipsilateral girdlestone.16. Patients with sickle cell disease.17.
             Patients with significant femoral head or neck deformity or significant acetabular
             wall deficiency.18. Patients with renal impairment where renal impairment is defined
             as serum creatinine&amp;gt; 180umol/L.
