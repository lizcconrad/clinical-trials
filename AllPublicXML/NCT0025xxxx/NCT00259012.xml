    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) profiles to determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of
      pantoprazole in infants aged 1 through 11 months.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including the terminal-phase disposition half-life, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. Half-life is the time required for half the quantity of absorbed drug to be metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including AUC, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including apparent oral clearance, were determined following a single oral dose of pantoprazole. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.</description>
