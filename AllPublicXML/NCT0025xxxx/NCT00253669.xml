      RATIONALE: Patients with gliomas may be at risk for developing blood clots. Learning about
      the risk factors for developing blood clots may help doctors plan better treatment for
      gliomas.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying risk factors for developing blood clots in patients
      who are undergoing cancer treatment for newly diagnosed gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall hazard rate of first venous thromboembolism per person-year of
           follow-up in patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy for newly diagnosed high-grade
           gliomas.

        -  Correlate ABO blood type with incidence of venous thromboembolism in these patients.

        -  Correlate factor VIII level with incidence of venous thromboembolism in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and individual incidence rate of thromboembolism in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate clinical variables, such as type of antineoplastic treatments, Karnofsky
           performance status, and type of tumor, with incidence of venous thromboembolism in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate demographic factors, such as age, with incidence of venous thromboembolism in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood collection for blood typing (if not already obtained) and factor VIII
      and C-reactive protein levels at baseline. Patients are followed to obtain information on
      their Karnofsky performance status, treatment they receive for their brain tumor, and
      occurrence of any thrombotic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis).
      Patients are followed every 28 days until the development of thrombotic events, after which
      they are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 107 patients will be accrued for this study.
