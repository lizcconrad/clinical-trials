  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study is intended to determine the long-term safety profile of
      dexlansoprazole MR over 12 months of dosing with 60 mg once-daily (QD) or 90 mg QD in
      subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including those with esophageal
      erosions.

      Prior to a protocol amendment, 300 subjects successfully completed one of the symptomatic
      nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux studies T-GD04-082 (NCT00251745) or T-GD04-083
      (NCT00251758) in which they were randomly assigned to receive placebo or dexlansoprazole MR
      60 or 90 mg QD. Subjects who were enrolled from one of these symptomatic GERD studies were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dexlansoprazole MR 60 or 90 mg QD in this
      long-term study.

      After implementation of protocol amendment #4, an additional 300 subjects with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease including those with erosive esophagitis will be enrolled and
      treated with dexlansoprazole MR 90 mg QD for 12 months.

      Approximately 200 study sites in the U.S. will participate.

      For all analyses involving visits during treatment from subjects enrolled prior to protocol
      amendment #4, baseline refers to pretreatment to Study T-GD04-082 (NCT00251745) or T-GD04-083
      (NCT00251758). For subjects enrolled under protocol amendment #4, baseline is based on
      screening or predosing measurement.
