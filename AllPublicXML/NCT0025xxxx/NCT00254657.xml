  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of levetiracetam in
      reducing the pain of fibromyalgia when compared to placebo. Levetiracetam, an anti-seizure
      drug, is currently FDA-approved and marketed for use in patients with seizures. Levetiracetam
      may relieve pain by reducing abnormal activity in the nervous system. A placebo is an
      inactive substance.

      The UCSF Pain Clinical Research Center (PCRC) will be conducting this investigator-initiated
      9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of Levetiracetam.
      There will be a total of 6 study visits. Visit 1 is a screening visit to assess subject
      eligibility, followed by a one-week period of baseline daily pain and sleep assessments.
      Visit 2 (one week after Visit 1) subjects will be randomized in a 3/2-randomization scheme
      and administered study medication. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will start
      Levetiracetam at 1 tablet of 500/mg/day, and will titrate by 500mg each week to a maximum
      dose of 3000 mg/day. Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (occurring 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after started study
      drug) include safety and efficacy assessments. Study drug taper is initiated at Visit 6.
