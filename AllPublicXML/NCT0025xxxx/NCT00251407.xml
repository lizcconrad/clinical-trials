  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of the combination of taxotere,
      cisplatin and CPT-11, that can be given without causing severe side effects. We also want to
      test the safety of this drug combination and see what effects (good and bad) it has on
      patients with advanced cancer for which there is no known curable treatment.

      -  This is a Phase I clinical trial. We are unsure of the safest and most effective dose of
           the drugs and therefore are planning on treating 3-6 patients with a given dose before
           increasing to higher dose levels.

        -  Each patient will receive approximately two cycles of therapy. On day one and day eight,
           they will receive taxotere, cisplatin and CPT-11 intravenously. The cycle will begin
           again on day 22.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed: CAT scan prior to beginning
           therapy, after every 2 cycles of therapy, and at the end of the study; physical exam
           before each course of therapy; vital signs before and with each dose of therapy; routine
           blood tests before starting therapy and weekly during treatment; chest x-ray and
           echocardiogram before starting therapy and; toxicity assessment each week of therapy.

        -  Patients will remain on the study as long as their cancer responds to treatment and they
           do not have unacceptable side effects.
