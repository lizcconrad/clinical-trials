      This trial will compare the effectiveness of electrothermal arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy
      (ETAC) to the current reference standard procedure, open inferior capsular shift (ICS), for
      the treatment of shoulder instability caused by ligamentous capsular redundancy.
      Multi-directional instability (MDI) and multi-directional laxity with anteroinferior
      instability (MDL-AII) are the two types of shoulder instabilities included in this trial.

      Hypothesis: There is no difference in disease-specific quality of life between patients
      undergoing an ETAC versus an open ICS for the treatment of shoulder instability caused by
      capsular ligamentous redundancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder is the most frequently dislocated joint in the body. Multiple causes and
      pathologies account for the various types of shoulder instability. Multi-directional
      instability (MDI) and multi-directional laxity with anteroinferior instability (MDL-AII) are
      similar in pathology, less common and more difficult to treat. These types of shoulder
      instability are caused by ligamentous capsular redundancy. When non-operative management
      fails for these patients, their quality of life is significantly impaired and surgical
      treatment is required to tighten the loose ligaments and joint capsule. A new way to treat
      these patients involves arthroscopic thermal shrinkage of the tissue to tighten the joint.
      However, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the use of this technique called,
      electrothermal arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy (ETAC). The current reference (gold) standard
      treatment for these patients is an open inferior capsular shift (ICS) procedure. Therefore,
      this trial will compare the effectiveness of these surgical techniques (ETAC vs. ICS) in
      patients with MDI and MDL-AII by determining patient related quality of life.

      This study is designed as a multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Patients diagnosed with
      either MDI or MDL-AII who failed standardized non-operative management will undergo a
      diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy, and if appropriate, will be subsequently randomized in the
      operating room to either an ETAC or ICS surgical procedure. Computer-generated, stratified
      block randomization is used. Stratification is based on two variables:

        1. surgeon - to account for any differences between surgeons, and

        2. diagnosis (MDI or MDL-AII) - to account for any differences in the severity of
           pathology.

      The disease-specific quality of life is assessed using a validated questionnaire, the Western
      Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, measured at baseline, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The
      WOSI index has 21 questions, divided into four categories to assess physical symptoms,
      sport/recreation/work, lifestyle and emotions. Each question is scored out of 100 using a
      visual analog scale response format. A lower score reflects a better quality of life.

    <description>The Oratec Vulcan Generator electro-thermal system (Oratec Interventions Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) delivers heat at 75C and 40 watts. An anterior portal is established above the superior border of the subscapularis tendon. For MDI patients, the heat probe is introduced through the posterior portal. The capsule is shrunk using a grid pattern until excess volume is diminished. The extent of the heat probe application is identical to the landmarks used for the open ICS. Care is taken to avoid applying heat to the capsule in the region from 5-7 o'clock within 1cm of the glenoid rim to avoid the axillary nerve. The method of heat application utilizes a grid pattern, which is less likely to cause dissolution of the capsule and subsequent catastrophic capsular loss.</description>

    <description>MDI: lateral capsule released antero-superiorly from rotator interval to equator, posteriorly on the humeral neck. MDL-AII: release from the rotator interval to 7 o'clock (Right) or 5 o'clock (Left) position on humeral neck, to tighten the 2 bands of the inferior GH ligaments, middle GH ligament and rotator interval. Bone adjacent to the articular surface on the surgical neck of the humerus is roughened to create a bleeding bony bed. With the arm in 0deg flexion, 30deg abduction, 30deg external rotation, the inferior leaflet of the capsule is shifted superiorly and slightly laterally, and sutured to the rim of the capsule using a non-absorbable suture. Superior leaflet is shifted inferiorly and sutured. Subscapularis is repaired at its anatomic length using interrupted sutures.</description>
