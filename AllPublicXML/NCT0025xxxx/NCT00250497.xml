      The New Moves study will evaluate the impact of a school based program for inactive high
      school girls who are overweight or at risk for being overweight due to low levels of physical
      activity. The primary study hypothesis is that girls in the intervention schools will
      significantly decrease their percent body fat as compared to girls in the control schools.
      Secondary research hypotheses include that girls in the intervention condition will
      significantly increase their physical activity levels and improve the quality of their
      dietary intake.

      The purpose of the New Moves study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based all
      girls alternative to regular physical education class for inactive high school girls. New
      Moves uses a large-scale community randomized controlled study involving girls from six
      intervention schools and six control schools. The New Moves class includes physical activity,
      nutritional guidance, and social support within a supportive, non-competitive environment. In
      addition the program includes individual counseling sessions.

      The primary research hypothesis is that girls in the intervention condition will
      significantly decrease their percent body fat as compared to girls in the control condition.
      Secondary research hypothesis to be tested are that girls in the intervention condition will
      significantly increase their level of physical activity and improve the quality of their
      dietary intake as compared to girls in the control condition. In addition a range of
      socioenvironmental, personal, and behavioral variables will be compared across conditions.

    <description>The 3DPAR assessed the sedentary behaviors and physical activities that study participants engaged in during each half hour time block between 6 AM and midnight on the three days previous to the day of data collection. In order to complete the 3DPAR, participants were provided with a list of 65 common sedentary behaviors and physical activities and were asked to select the activity that they participated in for the majority of every 30-minute block. The number of blocks of physical activity were summed for each day and then averaged over the 3 days. Outcomes was the average # of 30 minute blocks of physical activity.</description>

    <description>Ten questions assessing use of unhealthy weight control behaviors in the past month (yes/no). Behavior categories included fasted, ate very little, took diet pills, made myself vomit, used laxatives, used diuretics, used food substitutes, skipped meals, smoked more cigarettes, and went on a diet. If a respondent reported doing any of these behaviors, they were classified as having used unhealthy weight control behaviors.</description>

In order to complete the 3DPAR, participants were provided with a list of 65 common sedentary behaviors and physical activities and were asked to select the activity that they participated in for the majority of every 30-minute block. The number of blocks of physical activity were summed for each day and then averaged over the 3 days. Outcomes was the average # of 30 minute blocks of physical activity.</description>
