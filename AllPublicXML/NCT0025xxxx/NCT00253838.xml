    <textblock>
      This study compares two different hip stem components. Both hip stems used in this study
      allow the femur bone to attach and grow into them for stability. The main difference between
      the two stems is that one of the stems, the SolutionÂ® Stem, is made from Cobalt Chrome, a
      type of metal, and does not have a hydroxylapatite (HA) coating, while the second stem
      included in the study, the Restoration hip stem, is made from titanium alloy, a different
      type of metal that has a roughened surface and allows for a hydroxylapatite (HA) coating to
      be applied to the entire length of the stem. The HA coating is a thin calcium phosphate layer
      on the stem to encourage the bone to grow into it. We are trying to see if there is any
      difference in the initial bony ingrowth between the two stems and to compare the results in
      patients over the first two years after the surgery and then again at the five-year period.

      Revision total hip arthroplasty is becoming increasingly common due to the large number of
      primary total hip arthroplasties being performed annually. Failure of these arthroplasties
      has led to an increasing number of patients requiring revision arthroplasty. Various methods
      have been used to reconstruct the hip during a revision procedure. These have generally
      consisted of a cemented or uncemented femoral stem. It is now generally accepted that
      uncemented femoral stems have improved results over cemented stems, especially in those cases
      with compromised bone stock. There are two main alloys used for the femoral revision
      component, that is cobalt chrome and titanium. There may be certain advantages to the use of
      titanium, in particular, a reduction in future bone loss caused by stress shielding. Stress
      shielding is commonly seen with cobalt chrome implants. In order to assess this and the
      overall survival of these two different implants a randomized clinical trial is proposed.
