    <textblock>
      The best antiseptic solution for cateheter care remains unknown.High concentration in aquous
      solution or low concentration in alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine actbetter than povidone
      iodine in aquous solutions. No study has compare alcoholic formulations of low concentration
      of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine for skin disinfection prior to insertion of central
      venous catheters.

      To compare the incidence of central venous catheter colonization after skin disinfection with
      either an alcoholic solution of povidone iodine or a combination of 0.5% chlorhexidine,
      0.025% Benzalkonium and 4% benzylic alcohol.

      To compare the incidence of catheter related bacteremia in the to study groups. To compare
      the local and general tolerance of the two antiseptic formulations
