  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ciclesonide compared to
      beclomethasone-HFA in the occurrence of Class 1 lens event for nuclear (NO), cortical (C), or
      posterior subcapsular (P) lens opacification within 12 months. Secondary objectives are to
      compare ciclesonide and beclomethasone with respect to class II and class III best corrected
      visual acuity and intraocular pressure from baseline to 12 months.

      This is a multi-center, multinational, active-controlled, double-blind, randomized (1:1)
      parallel group study of the effects of inhaled ciclesonide HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day and
      beclomethasone HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day on lens opacification in adult subjects with moderate to
      severe persistent asthma. The study consists of a 1-14 day screening phase during which
      subject eligibility will be determined, followed by a 12-month double-blind treatment phase.
      Lens opacification will be evaluated by slit lamp examination performed after pupillary
      dilation to at least 6.0 mm before randomization and after 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months
      of treatment using the LOCS III system for grading lens opacities. Best-corrected visual
      acuity and intraocular pressure will be measured at each eye examination visit. An
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be constituted to monitor safety throughout
      the double-blind treatment phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females 18 years of age and older with a history
             of moderate to severe persistent asthma for a duration of at least 2 months prior to

             prior to screening.

          -  Able to demonstrate acceptable oral inhaler technique.

          -  Non-smoker for at least the past year and less than a 10 pack-year smoking history if
