    <textblock>
      Developmental dyslexia is a frequent learning disability. The aim of this study is to analyze
      cortical thickness and phonological treatment in right handed adults with developmental
      dyslexia. They are compared to control adults paired with age and laterality. To study
      phonological treatment, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      with a rime judgement task and silent word generation.

        This is a prospective study including 15 right-handed male subjects, aged 18 to 35 years,
        carrying a developmental dyslexia and 15 control subjects handed the same sex. We chose to
        include only male subjects to obtain a homogeneous population and to avoid the problem of a
        functional organization differs according to gender.
