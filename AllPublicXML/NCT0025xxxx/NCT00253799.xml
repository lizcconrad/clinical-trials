    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the safety and efficacy (over the course of 26 weeks) of 2
      intra-articular (IA) Hylan GF-20 (Synvisc) injections in addition to customary care in
      patients with painful glenohumeral osteoarthritis.

             this study.

               -  Agree to receive fluoroscopically guided injections.

               -  Be men or women aged 35 years or older.

               -  If female and of childbearing age, must have a negative pregnancy test and have
                  taken oral contraceptives for at least one month prior to treatment and continue
                  for the duration of the study (up to and including the final study visit) or

                  sterile or postmenopausal for at least one year.

               -  Have painful, non-inflammatory unilateral osteoarthritis of the shoulder. OA in
                  the contralateral shoulder is permissible provided that the OA symptoms are
                  greater in the study joint. The presence of soft tissue pathology (e.g., rotator
                  cuff tear) is permitted, and will be evaluated by an MRI (taken within 6 months
                  of study entry).

               -  Report an initial visual analogue pain score (VAS) of ≥ 30 and ≤ 80.

               -  Have radiographic confirmation of osteoarthritis of the shoulder prior to
                  baseline (modified Kellgren and Lawrence Numerical Grading System Grades II – IV)
                  on radiographs performed within 12 weeks of screening

               -  Have pain from shoulder OA requiring frequent (&gt; 3 days/week) use of analgesics
                  or NSAIDs for at least 8 weeks prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use adequate contraception.

               -  Prior viscosupplementation in target shoulder joint within 1 year of study entry.

               -  Known sensitivity to avian protein or any components of hyaluronan based
                  infection devices, steroids, lidocaine.

               -  Known Sensitivity to contrast agent.

               -  Used systemic steroids or have had an intra-articular steroid injection in the
                  target shoulder within the last 3 months.

               -  Rapidly progressive disease.

               -  Acute disease or trauma leading to osteoarthritis of the joint within 2 years of
                  study entry.

               -  Presence of a primary inflammatory arthropathy (e.g., rheumatoid, psoriatic, or
                  gouty arthritis).

               -  Active skin or soft tissue infection in the area of the injection site.

               -  Cervical spin disorders (e.g., radiculopathy) that have been symptomatic and
                  required active treatment within the past 3 months.

               -  Any active musculoskeletal condition that would impede measurement of the
                  efficacy of the target shoulder joint (such as fibromyalgia).

               -  Any major surgery, arthroplasty or arthroscopy in the target shoulder within 26
                  weeks of screening or planned surgery within the duration of the study.

               -  Septic arthritis in any joints within 3 months prior to screening; any history of
                  septic arthritis in the target shoulder.

               -  Any significant chronic skin disorders that could interfere with the evaluation
                  of the injection site.

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy or infectious complications.

               -  Active malignancy receiving treatment.
