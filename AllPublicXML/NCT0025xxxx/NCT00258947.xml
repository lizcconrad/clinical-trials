      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the smallpox vaccination take rate in healthy young adults not previously
      vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To describe antibody response to vaccination and evaluate the take for each subject at
      various timepoints for each batch and pooled batches and to evaluate local signs, symptoms,
      and overall safety in healthy young adults not previously vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine.
