    <textblock>
      Reduction of spasticity has been a major focus of the treatment of childhood cerebral palsy,
      resulting in numerous treatment strategies that target various parts of the motor system.
      However, in many children weakness may be a greater contributor to disability than
      spasticity. Recent results suggest a correlation between spasticity and weakness, but it is
      not known if reduction of spasticity can improve strength.

      We suggest a simplified model in which spinal mechanisms (including reflex contributions to
      spasticity) and supraspinal mechanisms (including voluntary contributions to strength)
      combine to activate muscle. The model implies that the supraspinal contribution cannot
      increase unless the spinal contribution decreases. We therefore hypothesize that reduction of
      spasticity improves the ability to increase voluntary strength.

      We propose a double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial combining treatment using the
      oral anti-spasticity medication baclofen with a 6-week program of strength training. We will
      enroll 20 ambulatory children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Prior to and following
      the intervention, we will obtain quantitative measures of spasticity, strength, and gait. We
      predict that the children taking baclofen will have a greater increase in strength than the
      children taking placebo. We predict that the increase in strength will be reflected in
      improved performance on gait analysis, and it will correlate with a reduction in quantitative
      measures of spasticity and spinal reflex excitability.

      If the hypothesis is correct, it will provide important new information on the relationship
      between spasticity and strength in children with cerebral palsy. It will provide the first
      measurements of the effect of baclofen on voluntary muscle activation in children. It will
      support the short-term use of combined anti-spasticity medication and strengthening as a new
      clinical treatment for ankle weakness in children with spastic diplegia. A successful result
      will have immediate and significant implications for treatment of children with cerebral
      palsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy 2. Spasticity at extensor muscle groups of one or both
             ankles according to the definition of the Task Force on Childhood Motor Disorders, and
             as evidenced by the presence of a spastic catch or velocity-dependent hypertonia on
             rapid passive muscle lengthening while the subject attempts to maintain a relaxed
             state 3. Ambulatory without assistive devices 4. Sufficient ability to follow
             instructions to be able to comply with the strengthening program and strength testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Contracture at the ankle, or a limitation of the passive range of motion such that
             neutral position is not achievable with the knee extended.

             2. Hypersensitivity or allergy to Baclofen or related medications, or any medical
             condition that would be expected to increase the risks of this study 3. Respiratory
             difficulty due to weakness, restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease,
             tracheomalacia, or laryngeal weakness 4. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease 5.
             Pregnancy or planned pregnancy (sexually active girls will be asked to take a urine
             pregnancy test prior to study entry) 6. Difficulty maintaining head position while
             standing or seated 7. Current use of other anti-spasticity agents, including valium,
             tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene, or similar agents 8. Use of oral baclofen within 3
             months prior to study entry 9. Injection of botulinum toxin into the calf muscles
             within 3 months prior to study entry 10. Prior implantation of a baclofen pump or
             deep-brain stimulator 11. Seizure within previous two years 12. Lower extremity
             dystonia 13. Bradykinesia or evidence of parkinsonism 14. Spinal cord injury 15.
             Neurodegenerative disease 16. Ankle, foot, lower leg, or Achilles tendon surgery
             within the previous year 17. Dorsal rhizotomy or neurotomy
