  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective descriptive cross sectional study to determine the percentage of
      patients presenting with dysphagia who are found to have eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and
      to establish which presenting factors warrant esophageal biopsies. We hypothesize that a
      greater than expected percentage of patients who are biopsies will have histologic changes
      consistent with EE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients presenting with dysphagia who do not already carry a previous diagnosis for
      their dysphagia will be asked to enroll. If patients have undergone previous work up for
      dysphagia such as manometry, 24-hour probe, or barium swallow they can still participate in
      this study. Informed consent will take place prior to enrollment. After patients present with
      dysphagia they will fill-out a questionnaire regarding their dysphagia symptoms. An EGD with
      biopsies will then be performed. Biopsies will be taken from 4 quadrants in the proximal and
      distal esophagus. The distal esophagus biopsies will be taken 5 cm proximal to the Z-line.
      Proximal biopsies will be taken anywhere proximal to 30 cm from the incisors.
