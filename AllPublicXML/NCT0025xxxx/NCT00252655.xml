  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sirolimus (Rapamune) in improving
      the function of the transplant kidney, without any increase in the risk of acute rejection or
      adverse side effects, compared with Tacrolimus (Prograf).

      We hypothesize that Sirolimus, as one component of a long-term steroid-free immunosuppressive
      regimen, will be effective in maintaining a low incidence of acute rejection and a short- and
      long-term graft survival comparable to Tacrolimus with better graft function in the high-risk
      African-American renal transplant population with immediate graft function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been repeatedly demonstrated that African-American renal allograft recipients have
      worse graft outcomes when compared with Caucasians. This has been attributed to various
      immunologic and non-immunologic factors, including a greater rate of acute rejection,
      resistance to standard doses of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids, different
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and noncompliance. It has therefore been
      suggested that quadruple immunosuppression, including antilymphocyte antibodies for
      induction, should be used in this high-risk population to improve graft survival. CNIs are
      currently the mainstay of immunosuppressive regimens. Tacrolimus has been shown to be
      significantly more effective than Cyclosporine A in preventing acute rejection. As a result,
      Tacrolimus has become the CNI of choice in preventing acute rejection, and has produced
      similar graft survival rates at one year, with higher creatinine clearances. However, there
      is no report examining the efficacy of Sirolimus in improving renal function and its side
      effect profile when compared with Tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients, particularly in
      African-Americans with immediate graft function in a steroid-free environment.
