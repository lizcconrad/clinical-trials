      The current study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      SR58611A (350 mg q12) compared to placebo in patients with generalized anxiety disorder
      (GAD), using escitalopram (10 mg qd) as a positive control. This is an 8-week, double-blind,
      randomized, 3-parallel-group, placebo- and escitalopram-controlled, study.A 1-week, placebo,
      single-blind period precedes the 8-week randomized treatment period. A Safety Follow up Visit
      (Segment C) is scheduled 1 week after the acute treatmentperiod (Segment B) or early
      termination. This trial is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      SR58611A to placebo. In this study, escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) antidepressant, is used as a positive control and has been chosen as the comparator
      agentas it is approved for treatment of GAD at a dose of 10 mg once daily.
