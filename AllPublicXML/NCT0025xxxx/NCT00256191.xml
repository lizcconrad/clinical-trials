  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a novel taxane analog, TPI 287. TPI 287 is
      synthetically manufactured from naturally occurring taxanes extracted from yew starting
      material. The synthesis involves modification to the taxane side chain to overcome multidrug
      resistance and to achieve mutant tubulin binding. This study will be a multi-center, dose
      escalation, sequential group, Phase 1 study evaluating the intravenous administration of TPI
      287 on an every 21 day cycle.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of TPI 287
      administered every 21 days for Phase II clinical trials.
