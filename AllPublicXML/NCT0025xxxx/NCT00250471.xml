      The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin to
      eptifibatide (with or without unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin)given to subjects at high
      risk for heart attack and other cardiovascular complications who will undergo surgery to open
      up blocked arteries in the heart.
