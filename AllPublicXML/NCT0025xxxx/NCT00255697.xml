      RATIONALE: Studying quality-of-life in patients having cancer treatment and in their
      caregivers may help identify the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients
      with cancer and on their caregivers.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying quality of life of older patients who are undergoing
      treatment for cancer and of their family caregivers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Obtain quality of life and psychosocial data from older patients who are undergoing
           treatment for cancer and from their family caregivers.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, cross-sectional study.

      Patients undergo a 45-minute interview in person or by phone to provide demographic data and
      to complete quality of life questionnaires, including Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT), Spiritual tool, Quality and Satisfaction with Treatment (QUEST), and Profile of Mood
      State (POMS), at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. Caregivers undergo a 20- to 30-minute
      interview in person or by phone to provide demographic data and complete quality of life
      questionnaires, including the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA), Quest, and POMS, at
      baseline and at 3 and 12 months. Caregivers complete the Quality of Death and Dying (QODD)
      questionnaire 2-3 months after the patient's death.
