      This study tests the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to reduce upset and burden
      among family caregivers, and decrease nursing home placement. The main hypothesis that will
      be tested is that compared to control group, subjects, experimental group participants will
      have enhanced well-being and fewer nursing home placements.

      Implement a multi-component in-home intervention designed to prevent and ameliorate the
      troublesome behaviors that families typically confront and that often trigger nursing home
      placement. The intervention combines the most effective strategies that have been identified
      in previous caregiver research by the investigative team and best clinical practices to
      provide a comprehensive service approach to families and individuals with dementia including
      education, skills training, home safety, and stress management. To enhance its applicability
      to real-world practice within the aging service network, the intervention is designed to be
      reproducible and its components and treatment goals commensurate with the Medicaid Waiver
      Program. In the absence of evidence-based service protocols currently in place for this
      Waiver population, the intervention, if effective, would provide a systematic, evidence-based
      approach in the Medicaid Waiver program to help families and persons with dementia remain at
      home and in their communities.

          -  Care-recipients must have a MMSE score &lt; 24 and a diagnosis of dementia, live in the
             community, and either need help with one or more daily activities and/or have one or
             more behavioral occurrences. Caregivers must be a relative, at least 21 years of age,
             be English speaking, have a telephone, either live with the care-recipient (CR) or
             spend at least 48 hours per week in direct oversight or caring for him/her; plan to
             live in the area for 9 months, report upset with CR function dependence or behavioral
             occurrences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The CG-CR dyad will be excluded if CR has had more than 3 hospitalizations within the
             past 12 months, are in treatment for life-threatening cancer, have schizophrenia or a
             bipolar disorder, have dementia secondary to head trauma, have a MMSE score = 0 and
             are bed-bound (defined as confinement to bed or chair for at least 22 hours a day for
             at least four of the previous seven days); or they are enrolled in a clinical trial of
             pharmacological treatment for agitation. Also, the dyad will be excluded if the CG had
             more than 3 hospitalizations within the past 12 months or is in treatment for
             life-threatening cancer; is involved in another clinical trial of psychosocial or
             educational interventions for caregivers; or plans to place their family member in a
             nursing home within the next 9-months.
