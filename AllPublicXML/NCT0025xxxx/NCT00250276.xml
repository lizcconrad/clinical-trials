  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer.
      Indeed, the infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared , can
      lead over time to cervical cancer in women . This study will compare the immune response
      induced by different lots of the HPV-16/18 L1/AS04 vaccine, following adjustments to the
      manufacturing process.

Additionally, a telephone contact was foreseen at Month 12. The vaccine was administrated by intramuscular (IM) injection into the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.</description>

        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], gastro-intestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Arthralgia (joint pain) = pain occurring in joints that were distal from the injection site.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</title>
        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], gastro-intestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Arthralgia (joint pain) = pain occurring in joints that were distal from the injection site. This outcome presents solicited general symptoms post dose 2 of vaccination.</description>
        <time_frame>During the 7-days (Day 0-6) post-vaccination</time_frame>
        <population>The Total Vaccinated cohort included all vaccinated subjects. The Total vaccinated cohort for analysis of safety included all subjects with at last one vaccine administration documented.</population>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</title>
          <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], gastro-intestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Arthralgia (joint pain) = pain occurring in joints that were distal from the injection site. This outcome presents solicited general symptoms post dose 2 of vaccination.</description>
          <population>The Total Vaccinated cohort included all vaccinated subjects. The Total vaccinated cohort for analysis of safety included all subjects with at last one vaccine administration documented.</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</title>
        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], gastro-intestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Arthralgia (joint pain) = pain occurring in joints that were distal from the injection site. This outcome presents solicited general symptoms post dose 3 of vaccination.</description>

        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], gastro-intestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Arthralgia (joint pain) = pain occurring in joints that were distal from the injection site. This outcome presents results across vaccination doses for solicited general symptoms.</description>
