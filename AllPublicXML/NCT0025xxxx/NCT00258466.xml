      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which type of radiation therapy is more effective in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different types of radiation therapy to
      compare how well they work in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of neutron and photon radiotherapy vs hypofractionated intensity
           modulated radiation, in terms of a lower frequency of chronic complication rate (chronic
           toxicity and disease-free survival), in patients with favorable to intermediate
           prognosis, stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      of disease (T1 vs T2 vs T3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo neutron radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 2
           weeks followed by photon radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo photon radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 5
           weeks followed by hypofractionated photon irradiation over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week
           for 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
