    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which short-acting blood thinner
      (low-molecular-weight heparin [Enoxaparin] or unfractionated heparin) is associated with less
      discomfort and bruising when given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection before and
      after a planned surgery or procedure in patients who temporarily stop warfarin.

      Increasing Patient Comfort and Compliance: The Bridging Anticoagulation Clinic strives to
      provide the highest quality of care to patients who require temporary interruption of
      warfarin therapy. An important component of optimizing patient care is minimizing patient
      discomfort with perioperative administration of short-acting anticoagulants (LWMH or UFH)
      used for bridging therapy, which, in turn, may optimize patient compliance with this
      treatment. This issue is especially relevant for patients who are receiving out-of-hospital
      treatment with LMWH or UFH because about 85% of such patients will be taught to
      self-administer this medication. This study seeks to determine if there is less discomfort
      and bruising associated with self-injection of LMWH than with UFH.

      Minimizing Injection Site Bruising: No studies, to our knowledge, have assessed the
      characteristics or clinical importance of bruising in patients receiving subcutaneous LMWH or
      UFH. Thus, there is no evidence to support any association between bruising and discomfort.
      To bridge this gap in knowledge, we will document each injection site during the course of
      the study and measure the amount of bruising observed using a standardized photographic
      methodology. Injection site bruising has the potential to cause medical problems if an
      injection site hematoma develops, which can become infected or can cause long-term
      discomfort.
