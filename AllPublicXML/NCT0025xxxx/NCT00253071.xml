  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether early integrated prophylactic combined
      medical and psychological outpatient treatment is associated with a better prognosis in
      patients with severe unipolar and bipolar affective disorders than standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been hospitalised for unipolar or bipolar disorder have a poor prognosis
      with highly increased risk of recurrence of episodes and increased risk of psychosocial
      dysfunction. It seems as integrated prophylactic combined medical and psychological
      out-patient treatment may lead to a better long-term prognosis in patients with affective
      disorders in general. It has not been specifically investigated whether such integrated
      treatment may improve long-term outcome if the intervention is offered early in the course of
      the affective illness.

      Subjects: Patients currently discharged from first, second or third hospitalisation ever from
      psychiatric department with a diagnosis of severe single depressive episode/recurrent
      depression or with a diagnosis of manic/mixed episode or bipolar disorder.

      Comparison: Early intervention with integrated prophylactic combined medical and
      psychological outpatient treatment as offered by a clinic for affective disorders compared
      with standard outpatient treatment as offered by community psychiatric centres, private
      specialists in psychiatry or general practitioners.
