      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells an
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving gemcitabine
      hydrochloride together with bevacizumab after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying gemcitabine hydrochloride and bevacizumab to see how
      well they work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients who are
      undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free interval in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
           treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs
           without bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Evaluate tumor gene expression profiles and levels of tumor angiogenesis markers to
           establish prognostic indicators for response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study.

      All patients undergo surgical resection for the pancreatic tumor. Within 4-8 weeks after
      surgery, patients are stratified according to projected 2-year survival (≤ 5% vs &gt; 5% and ≤
      33% vs &gt; 33%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for 6 courses. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV alone every 2 weeks for up to 2
           years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients will be accrued for this study.
