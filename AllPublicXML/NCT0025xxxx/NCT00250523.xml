  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gather clinical and biologic information from
      severely injured patients to better understand and characterize the host response to injury
      and inflammation across several domains. This information may improve outcome prediction,
      improve clinical treatment of injured patients, and permit the construction of non-biologic
      computerized models of illness that can be utilized to represent the host response in future
      research efforts. This study is designed as the calibration of a mathematical model of this
      response with predictive capabilities.

      The central hypothesis governing this study is that adaptive immune elements are crucial to
      determining the outcome of complex inflammatory scenarios. We propose to test these
      hypotheses in the following interrelated Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To develop a robust mathematical model describing trauma/hemorrhage-induced
      inflammation in humans, its pathologic consequences, and possible therapies.

      Specific Aim 2: To translate the mathematical model to humans and create software aimed at
      individualized clinical decision-making.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the prevalence of an IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1)
      variant haplotype located on the X-chromosome in an injured population, and to characterize
      differences in the pro-inflammatory response across gender, relative to the IRAK-1 haplotype.

      Specific Aim 4: To determine if increased arginase activity previously observed in isolated
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of trauma patients is a consequence of the presence of
      contaminating activated granulocytes or a particular subset of an arginase positive monocyte
      subset.

      For trauma injury cohort: The maximum blood volume collected over the 28 day period, if all
      samples are obtained, is approximately 90 cc. All standard precautions will be undertaken to
      assure minimal risk.

      Blood samples will be obtained for genetic analysis of inflammatory gene polymorphisms. We
      will collect whole blood, serum and white cells.
