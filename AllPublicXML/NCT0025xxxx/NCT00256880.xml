      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug
      is in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The treatment involves
      daily dosing. A patient may continue to receive the treatment as long as they are benefiting
      from the treatment. Blood samples will be taken at specific times to measure the amount of
      drug in your body at specific times after the drug is given. Blood samples will also be taken
      for lab tests such as complete blood counts and clinical chemistries. Physical exams will be
      performed before each treatment. During the treatment phase, the patients will undergo
      regular assessments for safety and clinical response.
