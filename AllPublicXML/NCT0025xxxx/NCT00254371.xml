  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a major health problem among the rapidly expanding elderly population in our
      society. Disabilities directly related to muscle weakness, and indirectly related to changes
      in body composition and metabolic dysfunctions, are causing a staggering toll in disability
      and health care costs.

      Osteopenia occurs almost simultaneously with sarcopenia in the elderly population and muscle
      weakness increases the risk for falls and therefore, fractures. Although these issues have
      been separate addressed in several studies, an integrated investigational approach to better
      understand the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and other age-related metabolic abnormalities and
      to investigate the potential role of androgens have not been undertaken in a comprehensive
      manner.

      The program contains four independent research programs, each representing different research
      disciplines, and four separate cores supporting the four projects.

      The main focus of the project is to determine the effect of the replacement of testosterone
      in elderly men and DHEA in elderly men and women and to compare these effects with placebo
      treatment over a two-year period.

      Project 1, &quot;Effect of Androgen Replacement on Muscle Metabolism&quot; will specifically determine
      whether these interventions have a differential effect on size and quality of muscle in terms
      of strength and metabolic functions. Project 2, &quot;Effect of Androgen Replacement on Bone
      Metabolism,&quot; will determine the effects of this intervention on bone mineral density and
      markers of bone turnover.

      Project 3, &quot;The Effect of Androgen Replacement on Carbohydrate Metabolism,&quot; will determine
      whether the age-associated decrease in circulating androgens contributes to the alterations
      in carbohydrate metabolism that are commonly observed in the elderly and on insulin action,
      insulin secretion, and glucose effectiveness.

      Project 4, &quot;Effect of Androgen Replacement on Fat Metabolism&quot; will determine whether changes
      in fat distribution that occur with aging could result from differences in regional fatty
      acid uptake and systemic fatty acid kinetics, and whether these determinants of fat
      distribution are altered by the interventions.

      The data emerging from these studies will be integrated to determine the intervention of
      sarcopenia with other metabolic changes and hopefully will contribute to a better
      understanding of muscle, bone, carbohydrate and fat metabolism.

      This study will hopefully form the scientific basis for future trials of androgen replacement
      in the elderly.
