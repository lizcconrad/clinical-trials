  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of daily treatment with
      Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) (60 mg or 90 mg once daily [QD]) compared to placebo QD
      in relief of daytime and nighttime heartburn over 4 weeks in subjects with gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study
      with a 4 week treatment period. This study will compare the efficacy of daily Dexlansoprazole
      MR (60 mg and 90 mg) with that of placebo when administered orally as a single daily dose in
      the morning, before breakfast. The study is designed to evaluate symptom relief in subjects
      with symptomatic non-erosive GERD. Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled at
      approximately 120 U.S. and potentially ex U.S. sites. The study consists of two periods; a
      Screening Period, which will last a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 21 days, and a
      treatment period, which will last 4 weeks.

      Because the development plan for Dexlansoprazole MR was revised, the results of 2 identical
      studies, T-GD04-082 (NCT00241745) and T-GD04-083 (this posting, NCT00251758), were combined
      and analyzed as a single larger study, referred to as study T-GD04-082. A total of 908
      subjects were included in the combined analysis; 416 subjects were enrolled into Study
      T-GD04-082 and 492 subjects were enrolled into Study T-GD04-083.
