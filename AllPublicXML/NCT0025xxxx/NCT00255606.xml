      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It
      is not yet known which schedule of docetaxel and prednisone is more effective in treating
      prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different schedules of docetaxel and
      prednisone to compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the time to treatment failure in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic
           prostate cancer treated with two different schedules of docetaxel in combination with
           prednisone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the need for epoetin beta in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the effect of epoetin beta on hemoglobin response rate, transfusion rate, and
           quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 and oral prednisone
           once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and prednisone once daily on
           days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who experience anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL) receive epoetin beta subcutaneously
      once weekly during chemotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks during study treatment, at completion
      of study treatment, and then every 2 months thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
