      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of minute doses of gluten in the
      treatment of celiac disease, a disorder characterized by permanent intolerance to dietary
      gluten.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of celiac disease (CD) is based on the complete avoidance of gluten-containing
      products in the diet. However it is not known whether tiny amounts of gluten are harmful for
      patients on long-term treatment. This is an important issue, as even a strict gluten-free
      diet (GFD) is usually contaminated by traces of gluten, e.g. in wheat starch and processed
      food. The aim of this study is to investigate the toxicity of the prolonged ingestion of
      gluten traces in treated CD patients. This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      study. Patients are adults with biopsy-proven CD on treatment with the GFD for at least 2
      years. During the study period their background daily gluten intake is kept lower than 5 mg.
      After baseline evaluation, patients continue their GFD and are assigned to ingest 0 mg, 10 mg
      or 50 mg of daily gluten (incorporated in a capsule) for 90 days. The following evaluations
      are performed both at baseline and after the micro-challenge: clinical, serological
      (anti-transglutaminase and antigliadin antibodies), and small intestine histology.
