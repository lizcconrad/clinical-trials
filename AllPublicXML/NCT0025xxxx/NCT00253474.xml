      RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PEG-interferon
      alfa-2b in treating young patients with plexiform neurofibroma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in patients with
           unresectable plexiform neurofibroma. (Dose escalation portion of study closed to accrual
           as of 2/2005.)

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Obtain, preliminary, information about the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the growth rate of plexiform neurofibroma using volumetric MRI analysis in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the impact of this drug, in terms of &quot;worst symptom&quot; score, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. (Dose-escalation portion of the study
      closed to accrual as of 2/2005.)

      Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PEG-interferon alfa-2b until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients receive treatment at
      the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
