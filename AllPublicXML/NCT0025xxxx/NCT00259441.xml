  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contrast induced kidney toxicity has been known to affect the mortality and morbidity in
      the patients undergoing coronary angiography. But the mechanism and therapeutic strategy for
      it is not well known. Nowadays, it is reported that the N-acetylcysteine may have preventive
      effects for contrast induced kidney toxicity with its antioxidant effects.The statins have
      been reported to have many other effects other than the lipid lowering effect-including
      antioxidant effect, so we hypothesized that the antioxidant effect of simvastatin may prevent
      the contrast induced kidney toxicity.

      The simvastatin may prevent the contrast agent induced acute renal failure in the patients
      with underlying renal insufficiency who is undergoing the coronary angiography. The effect
      may derive from the antioxidant function of simvastatin.
