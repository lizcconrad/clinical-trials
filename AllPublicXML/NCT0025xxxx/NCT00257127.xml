  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine immune system function following vaccination in
      HIV-infected children currently taking anti-HIV drugs. To test the effectiveness of prior
      vaccination, patients in this study will receive booster shots of one of two pneumococcal
      vaccines, a hepatitis B vaccine, and a measles vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With their immunocompromised status, HIV-infected children are at especially high risk for
      opportunistic infections, including infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, hepatitis B, and
      measles. In PACTG P1024, HIV-infected children taking highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART) received 2 doses of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), 1 dose of the
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), and booster shots of the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)
      and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). Early responses to these vaccinations were
      favorable, but with declining antibody responses within the 18 months after vaccination. It
      is unknown if additional booster vaccinations in these children will result in a protective
      immunologic memory upon re-exposure to these pathogens. This study will determine whether
      HIV-infected children on HAART have evidence of specific immunologic memory 3 to 4 years
      after vaccination in PACTG P1024.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive PCV or PPV at study entry. All eligible
      patients will also receive HBV and MMR at study entry. Patients will be monitored in the
      clinic for 1 hour after vaccination for any adverse effects. Study staff will contact
      patients by phone around Day 3 after study entry to ask patients if they have experienced any
      adverse effects to the vaccinations; patients who received MMR at study entry will be
      contacted again around Day 21. Some patients may be asked to return to the clinic for further
      evaluation if they experience side effects.

      There will be study visits at study entry and Days 7 and 28. Medical history, a physical
      exam, blood collection, and an assessment of HIV-related symptoms will occur at all visits.
      HAART will not be provided by this study.
