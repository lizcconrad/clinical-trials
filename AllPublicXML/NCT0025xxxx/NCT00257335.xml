      To demonstrate safety and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for treatment
      of previously irradiated recurrent head and neck cancer.

      Specific Aims: Identify acute and late toxicities, response rates, locoregional control,
      disease free survival, and overall survival with IMRT. Also, tumor response, the amount of
      tumor shrinkage or reduction, will be analyzed.

      Rationale: Recurrent head and neck cancer is regarded as having limited treatment modalities
      since salvage surgery can only be accomplished on limited subgroups of patients. Chemotherapy
      has not shown clear clinical benefits and has significant toxicity. Re-irradiation has been
      used as a treatment modality. However, the re-irradiation dose is limited by significant
      toxicity that occurs with the cumulative dose of radiation. The use of IMRT can give a high
      dose to the recurrent tumor while limiting the dose to critical structures in the vicinity of
      the reirradiated volume thereby limiting toxicity and treating the recurrence to an adequate
      dose.

      The number of subjects was determined from 2 stage design with a historical control group as
      comparison, and these numbers of subjects were found to be 40.

      It is assumed that this treatment regimen will not be of further interest if the true
      response rate is less than 32.6% (Po0.326). It is also assumed that a true response rate of
      53% or more (P10.53) would be of considerable interest in the treatment of recurrent head and
      neck cancer. The type I error (the probability of rejecting the hypothesis that the
      proportion responding to the treatment is less than or equal to Po when this hypothesis is
      actually true) is 0.05.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have pathologically confirmed recurrence (reappearance of previously
             cleared) of a squamous cell cancer primary located in the upper aerodigestive tract or
             a second squamous cell primary. Patients may have experienced more than one recurrence
             as long as the first recurrence occurred greater than 6 months following the end of
             the prior RT. Pathology slides from primary as well as recurrence must to be obtained
             for review by UCI Department of Pathology to confirm histology and patient
             eligibility. Previous radiation records including simulation and portal films must be
             submitted to the UCI Department of Radiation Oncology for review of treated areas and
             to assure that spinal cord tolerance is not exceeded.

          2. The recurrence or second primary must have defined bidimensional measurement as
             follows: All tumor measurements must be recorded in centimeters and should consist of
             the two longest perpendicular cross-diameters. Patients will be separately assessed
             for response by physical exam and by CT scan with contrast (unless contraindicated) or
             MRI scan with T1 contrast with gadolinium (unless contraindicated) and T2 sequences
             prior to and two months following completion of therapy. Both the clinical (physical
             exam) and radiographic (CT or MRI) response will be recorded on the study forms.

          3. Recurrence or second primary must be confined to the head and neck above the clavicle.

          4. The patient must not be a candidate for or refuses complete surgical (re)resection.

          5. The majority (&gt;75%) of the tumor volume must have been in areas previously irradiated
             to &gt;45 Gy. The previous irradiation must not exceed a maximum of 75 Gy.

          6. Primary and recurrent cancer treatment cumulative radiation dose must limit total
             spinal cord dose to 50 Gy.

          7. Patients must be at least 1 month from prior chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

          8. Karnofsky status 60 or greater. (appendix)

          9. WBC &gt;4000/mm3, granulocytes &gt;2,000/mm3, platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, serum bilirubin &lt;1.5
             mg/dl, creatinine &lt;1.8 mg/dl within one month from enrollment in protocol.

         10. If liver chemistries are above normal limits, a liver ultrasound or CT will be
             required.

         11. Patient must not have a history of other invasive malignancies within the past five
             years, excluding non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in-situ.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Distant metastases.

          2. History of other invasive malignancies within the past five years excluding
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in-situ.

          3. Medical condition, which would impede patient tolerance of therapy, completion of
             therapy or limit survival.

          4. Women who are pregnant will be excluded from this trial. A pregnancy test will be
             offered to women of child bearing age who are otherwise eligible for the protocol.

          5. Patients under 18 years of age will be excluded since head and neck cancer is unlikely
             and due to risk of long term toxicity from radiation including secondary malignancy

          6. Patients on any treatment currently for the recurrent head and neck cancer

          7. Patients have any untreated infection

          8. Patients are candidate for complete surgical resection.

          9. Patients have the previous irradiation exceeded a maximum of 75 Gy
