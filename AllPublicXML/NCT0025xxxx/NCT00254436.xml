      Anemia and fatigue are common problems in gastric and rectal cancer subjects at the
      completion of chemoradiation therapy and surgery. Results of several studies in cancer
      subjects suggest that treatment with epoetin alfa may be effective in maintaining hemoglobin
      levels, thereby reducing fatigue, decreasing transfusion requirement, and potentially
      improving quality of life.
