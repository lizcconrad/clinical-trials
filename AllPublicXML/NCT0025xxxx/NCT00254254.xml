  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first evaluation of exenatide in adolescent subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and is designed to evaluate the blood levels of the drug
      (pharmacokinetics), the drug's biochemical and physiological effects (pharmacodynamics), and
      tolerability of exenatide in these subjects.
