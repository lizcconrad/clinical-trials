      The principal objective to this randomized trial is to compare the efficacy of two strategies
      of intra-operative hemodynamic management during cardiopulmonary bypass among patients
      undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in preventing
      peri-operative cardiac, cognitive and neurologic morbidity and mortality and post-operative
      deterioration in the patient's quality of life as measured by the seven domains of SF-36
      Health Survey (bodily pain, health perceptions, energy, and mental, physical, social and role
      function).

      In one group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 65 mmHg. In the other, the MAP target was
      determined by the patients usual preoperative MAP. Thus, the trial will evaluate whether
      tailoring the MAP target for the period of cardiopulmonary bypass to within 10 mmHg of the
      patients usual MAP, but &lt; 90 mmHg (and thus achieving pressures during bypass within the
      patients usual autoregulatory range) reduces major neurologic and cardiac morbidity and
      mortality, as well as cognitive complications, thereby improving post-operative quality of
      life.
