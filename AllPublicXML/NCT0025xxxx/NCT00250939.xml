    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their
      normal function. The overall objective is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      efficacy of Myozyme treatment.
