  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet
      known whether giving radiation therapy together with vinorelbine and cisplatin is more
      effective than radiation therapy alone in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy
      together with vinorelbine and cisplatin works and compares it to radiation therapy alone in
      treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer
           treated with vinorelbine, cisplatin, and continuous hyperfractionated accelerated
           radiotherapy (CHART) vs CHART alone.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response, progression-free survival, and quality of life of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effect of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the cost effectiveness of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the local and distant control in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) 3
           times a day for 12 consecutive days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin
           IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4-6 weeks later, patients
           undergo CHART as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically for at least 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
