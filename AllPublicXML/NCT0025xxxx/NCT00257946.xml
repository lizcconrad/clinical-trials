      The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of 2 different types of biosynthetic
      material for the repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The research question is: what is
      the best material for repairing large congenital diaphragmatic hernias? The primary outcome
      variable is recurrence.

      At birth, the estimated gestational age and birth weight will be recorded, as well as the
      presence and type of other congenital anomalies.

      Prior to operation, the length of time from birth to repair will be recorded. To determine
      the severity of physiologic compromise, the need and type of ventilator support as well as
      the need and length of ECMO support will be recorded. The amount of time between ECMO
      discontinuation and repair will be recorded. The respiratory support required at the time of
      operation will be recorded.

      At operation, the size of the defect will be measured and recorded. The location (right
      versus left) will be recorded and special notation will be recorded regarding any areas where
      no diaphragmatic rim is present. The operative time and charges will be recorded.

      After the operation, the length of ventilator support, time to feeds, hospital stay, and
      hospital charges will be recorded. Post-operative complications such as bleeding
      complications, pneumonia, sepsis, gastroesophageal reflux, early recurrence and bowel
      obstruction will be recorded. Future operations and type of procedure will be recorded. If
      future operations in the abdomen are required, the amount and severity of intraperitoneal
      adhesions will be noted and recorded. Mortality will be recorded.

      After discharge, commensurate with standard current clinical practice, all patients will
      receive a follow-up appointment with a chest x-ray at 6 months and 1 year of life. After this
      time, follow-up appointments will be made each year for the first 5 years of life and imaging
      will be obtained on the basis of symptoms. Any further follow-up will be as needed for
      symptoms. Oxygen requirements, findings at follow-up and future hospitalization will be
      recorded, particularly looking at the presence or absence of hernia recurrence. The study
      will mature and effectively close when all subjects have reached 5 year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of congenital
             diaphragmatic hernia as proven by chest x-ray showing enteric contents in the thoracic
             cavity will be considered. Those who have birth weight equal to or over 2.2 kilograms
             and who are at or beyond 34 weeks gestation at the time of birth who survive until an
             operation can be performed will be considered. At operation, the patients with
             posterolateral diaphragmatic defects (Bockdalek Hernia) large enough to require
             placement of a patch to recreate the diaphragm will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children diagnosed outside of the neonatal period will not be considered. Patients
             with the less common anteromedial or substernal defect (Morgagni Hernia) will not be
             included in the study as their physiology and rate of recurrence are incomparable to
             common posterolateral, Bockdalek Hernia.

        Those patients under 2.2 kilograms and less than 34 weeks gestation have poor lung maturity
        to compound their inherent difficulty with pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia and pulmonary
        vasculature hypertension making their chances of survival extremely low. Further
        compounding their dismal circumstance, they are not candidates for salvage extracorporeal
        membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therefore, they will not be candidates for the study.

        The rare case requiring repair of the hernia while on ECMO support will not be included due
        to the fact that this population has a very poor survival secondary to irreversible
        pulmonary hypertension. Further, the operation is performed while the patient is
        anticoagulated with heparin which is fraught with operative and post-operative bleeding.
