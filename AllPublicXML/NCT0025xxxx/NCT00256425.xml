  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive rehabilitation is effective in
      patients with gliomas (brain tumour), by comparing direct and follow-up neuropsychological
      functioning and quality of life of the experimental group to the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with (low-grade) glioma exhibit cognitive symptoms and objective
      deficits, which have a sustained, negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life.

      Adult patients with a low-grade glioma, either histologically proven, or suspected (1), as
      well as adult anaplastic glioma patients with favorable prognostic factors (2), who are
      clinically stable for at least 6 months, will be recruited from 9 hospitals in the
      Netherlands. Consenting patients with both subjective cognitive symptoms and objective
      deficits will be randomized to either the cognitive rehabilitation program (N = 75) or a
      &quot;waiting-list&quot; control group (N = 75). Upon completion of the study, those patients assigned
      to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo the cognitive rehabilitation
      program.

      The cognitive rehabilitation program incorporates both retraining of impaired cognitive
      functions, and teaching of compensatory strategies. Rehabilitation will be directed towards
      attention, memory and executive functioning. The intervention will consist of 6 weekly,
      individual, 2-hour sessions plus two hours of homework.

      To evaluate the efficacy of the rehabilitation program, objective neuropsychological
      functioning, self-reported cognitive symptoms and health-related quality of life will be
      assessed before rehabilitation, directly following rehabilitation, and at 6-month follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult patients with a histologically proven low-grade glioma or presumed (i.e.,
             suspected) low-grade glioma based on both clinical and MR imaging feature, and

          -  adult patients with an anaplastic glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
             oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligo-astrocytoma) under age 50 and with good
             performance status (KPS &gt; 70);

          -  who are clinically stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to study entry (as
             determined by recent CT or MRI imaging) and no anti-tumor treatment during that period
             of time (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, corticosteroids);

          -  who report at least one symptom of impaired cognitive functioning based on a
             standardized self-report questionnaire, administered by researcher;

          -  and who meet criteria for neuropsychological impairment based on objective test
             results (assessed by researcher).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  lack of basic proficiency in Dutch;

          -  IQ below 85;

          -  severe reading problems;

          -  an additional (history of) neurological or psychiatric disorder;

          -  participating in a concurrent study in which neuropsychological testing and/or
             health-related quality of life assessments are involved
