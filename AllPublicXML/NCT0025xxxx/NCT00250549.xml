  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OraQuick is a safe, rapid test that accurately identifies HIV in as little as 20 minutes. By
      providing an accurate, quick method for detecting a person's serostatus and access to
      immediate post-test counseling, rapid testing has a crucial role in identifying HIV status
      and improving post-test counseling rates in populations who are at high risk of HIV infection
      and high failure to return rates. This prospective randomized control trial compared the
      educational effectiveness of a fifteen-minute post-test counseling video with the normal
      practice of a session with an HIV counselor.

      A convenience sample of stable patients presenting to the walk-in section of the Jacobi
      Medical Center Adult ED were recruited for rapid HIV testing. After consenting for the rapid
      HIV test and completing measures on condom intention and condom use self-efficacy,
      participants were randomized to either a fifteen-minute HIV post-test educational video
      available in English or to an HIV counselor for post-test counseling. Afterwards, both groups
      completed a measure of HIV knowledge assessing relevant testing information and level of
      satisfaction. An equivalence analysis was carried out to assess whether the video was at
      least as good as counseling, measured by total score on the knowledge questionnaire, with a
      lower equivalence bound of -5%.
