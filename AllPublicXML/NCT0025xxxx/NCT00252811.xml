  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects with
      histologically-confirmed oestrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative
      (PgR-) primary breast cancer breast cancer will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive ZD1839 250 mg once daily or matching placebo for a total period of 5 weeks. Surgical
      intervention will take place after 4 weeks (on Day 29) and treatment will continue for 1 week
      after surgery.
