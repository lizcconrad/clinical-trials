      OBJECTIVE – The role of health promotion for patients with impaired fasting glucose on
      preventing or delay the progression of diabetes mellitus has not been widely investigated in
      Taiwan. The purposes of this study are to explore the nature history of prediabetes, to
      evaluate the incidence of DM in prediabetes and to establish the cohort of people with
      prediabetes. Further study will be based on this cohort to evaluate the effect of health
      promotion and to compare the concentration of certain protein in their serum, such as
      adiponectin.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS –A total of 600 subjects aged 40-60 years with impaired fasting
      glucose (100-125 mg/dl) were randomly selected from the Peng-Hu clinics during January 2003
      and December 2003. Anthropometric, biochemical, and metabolic characteristics will be
      measured, including weight, height, waist circumference, oral glucose tolerance test,
      triglyceride, high and low density cholesterol, blood pressure and insulin resistance etc. A
      questionnaire interviews with subjects regarding demographic characteristics is also
      performed. 300 subjects will receive education of health promotion. Simultaneously, 150
      subjects with normal fasting plasma glucose (&lt;100 mg/dl) will selected for comparison.

      Statistical Analysis - Descriptive data will be described as means and SDs for continuous
      variables, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square tests were used for assessing the
      significances. Bonferroni method was used for post-hoc comparison in ANOVA. Multiple linear
      regressions were used for predicting determinants of FPG. We tested the variables scales in
      this study for multicollinearity by correlation matrix and VIF (variance inflation factor).
      Odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the
      relative risk of diabetes mellitus by logistic regression model. A p-value below 0.05 was
      considered significant. The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical
      Package.
