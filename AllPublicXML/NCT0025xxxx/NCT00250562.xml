  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valsartan, an orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker, is registered in most countries
      worldwide for the treatment of hypertension. In China the usual recommended starting and
      maintenance dose is 80 mg o.d. The combination of HCTZ 12.5 mg with valsartan 80 mg has been
      shown to have additive effects in lowering blood pressure compared to valsartan 80 mg in
      patients not adequately controlled by valsartan 80 mg monotherapy5 or in non-selected
      patients6. This fixed combination is registered in most countries worldwide.

      The potential benefits of these combinations should be evaluated in patients not adequately
      controlled by valsartan 80 mg monotherapy. This study will compare the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of adding HCTZ 12.5 mg to valsartan 80 mg in those hypertensive patients.

      This study is not recruiting in the US.
