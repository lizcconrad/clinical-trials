      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and docetaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine together with docetaxel
      works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with androgen-independent metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with capecitabine and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
           of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 5-18. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional
      courses of therapy beyond CR

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
