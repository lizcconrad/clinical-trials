  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma remains a malignancy that is largely resistant to chemotherapy. Metastatic disease
      responds poorly to the treatments used today with only 2 out of 30 drugs tested, DTIC and
      nitrosoureas, showing response rates greater than 10%, and complete responses are rare.
      DTIC-based regimen has been recognized as a standard chemotherapy for advanced melanoma, and
      temozolomide demonstrated efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative agent
      that also crosses the blood brain barrier. Randomized phase III trials have shown no survival
      benefit of adding other agents (cisplatin, BCNU, and tamoxifen). Biochemotherapy is being
      developed extensively with moderate improvement in the responsive rate (approximately 50%)
      and is under evaluation in randomized trial to identify whether there is survival benefit to
      this strategy, compared with chemotherapy alone. Recently, a randomized phase III study
      comparing chemotherapy (cisplatin, dacarbazine, and tamoxifen) with biochemotherapy (the same
      chemotherapy regimen plus high-dose IL-2 and interferon alfa) have shown 44% response rate
      for biochemotherapy vs. 27% for chemotherapy. However, the tendency toward an increased
      response rate in patients who received biochemotherapy did not translate into an increase in
      overall survival, and there was, in fact, a trend for a survival advantage in patients
      receiving chemotherapy alone (median survival: 10.7 vs 15.8 months). New agents (or
      combinations) need to be developed for this refractory malignancy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and evaluate the toxicity of
      disulfiram (DSF) in the treatment of Stage IV melanoma.

      The advantages of using DSF in this phase I/II trial are the following:

        -  DSF has been used as a drug for many years for the treatment of alcoholism. Its
           mechanism, pharmacokinetics, toxicity/tolerable dose are well known, and this drug is
           relatively non-toxic by itself at therapeutic dose. Doses of greater than 3000mg/m2 can
           cause reversible confusion.

        -  DSF can be taken orally; therefore, it is convenient to administer.

        -  DSF can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (unlike dacarbazine and many other
           chemotherapy agents); therefore, it might have an active effect on CNS metastasis.

      This study is designed to include women and minorities, but is not designed to measure
      differences of intervention effect.

    <description>Complete response (CR)-Complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease. No disease related symptoms. No evidence of non-evaluable disease, including normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial response (PR)-Applies only to patients with at least one measurable lesion. Greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. No progression of evaluable disease. For both CR and PR, no new lesions. All assessments use the same techniques as baseline.</description>

    <description>Accelerated titration designs are used for the maximum tolerated dose.
Patients will remain at one dose level for one week before escalated to the next higher dose level, providing that no grade II or III toxicity occurs.
Phase II is to use the maximum tolerated dose of DSF (as described above) to determine the response rate. Evaluation of toxicities will be continued. Dose reduction (switch to the next lower dose) will be carried out if patient develops grade III/IV toxicities, and this dose reduction applies to both phase I and phase II.</description>

    <description>DSF pills at 250 mg will be given orally, two times a day. If this dose is tolerated, the dose will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment will continue every day for 3 months or longer unless the disease gets worse, the side effects are too dangerous for the subject, or the subject decides to discontinue treatment.</description>

             which is Stage IV.

          -  Patient must have bidimensionally measurable disease. All measurable lesions must be
             assessed (by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide scan or plain X-ray) within
             28 days prior to registration. Non-measurable sites must be assessed within 42 days
             prior to registration. The patient's disease status must be completely assessed and
             reported.

          -  All patients must undergo a CT of abdomen and chest within 28 days prior to
             registration.

          -  All patients must undergo either a CT or MRI of the brain within 28 days of
             registration. Patients with or without brain metastasis are both recruited for this
             protocol.

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy,
             biologic/immunotherapy, or a combination regimen) for metastatic disease. Prior
             systemic therapy must have been completed at least 28 days before registration.

             working day.

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             protocol are not qualified for this study.

          -  Patients requiring ongoing therapy with other investigational drugs are excluded.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are not eligible to participate in this trial because the
             safe use of this drug in pregnancy has not been established.
