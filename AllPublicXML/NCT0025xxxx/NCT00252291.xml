  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Aridol bronchial
      challenge test to detect bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with suspected asthma.
      Patients with suspected asthma of either gender, aged between 6 and 50 years, with only
      mildly impaired lung function (FEV1 &gt;70%) are to be tested with three different bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness challenges (Aridol, exercise and methacholine), and the results compared.
      A clinical diagnosis will also be made at the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have given informed consent to participate in this study in accordance with local
             regulations prior to any procedures being performed

          2. Have signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma according to the NIH Questionnaire but
             has not been given a firm diagnosis of asthma or a firm exclusion of the diagnosis of
             asthma (e.g. has an equivocal diagnosis of asthma or been referred for further
             investigation of asthma type symptoms)

          3. Have at least Step 1 symptoms according to the NAEPPII asthma severity grading

          4. Have an FEV1 ≥ 70% of the predicted value at Screening Visit (Visit 1) baseline

          5. Be between 6 and 50 years

          6. Be able to perform all of the techniques necessary to measure lung function including
             an exercise challenge, Aridol challenge and methacholine challenge

          7. Be able to understand the requirements of the study and be able to complete all of the
             forms necessary including the NIH Questionnaire

          8. Be taking effective birth control if female of childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use medications six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the study
             that would interfere with bronchial provocation challenge testing (see Table 1,
             section 3.3.3.4)

          2. Currently use cholinesterase-inhibitor medication (for myasthenia gravis)

          4. Have known aortic or cerebral aneurysm, cirrhosis or portal hypertension

          5. Have had recent major surgery

          6. Have had recent cataract surgery

          7. Have a history of heart disease that would increase risk of performing exercise,
             methacholine or Aridol challenge

          8. Have had cardiac ischemia or malignant arrhythmias

          9. Have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 and diastolic blood
             pressure ≥ 100)

         10. Have orthopedic limitations

         11. Have smoked within the past year (average &gt; 1 cigarette per week), or have a ≥ 10 pack

             COPD, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, pulmonary
             carcinoma, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, hypercapnia)

         13. Be skin test positive to seasonal and perennial aeroallergens that are present in the
             environment during the time that the subject is enrolled in the study, or if skin test
             positive to these aeroallergens the subject must not report worsening of symptoms when
             exposed to these aeroallergens during the time that the subject is participating in
             the study

         14. Have a medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would impair the
             ability of the subject to participate

         15. Have an inability to perform spirometry of acceptable quality

         16. Be intolerant to Aridol, methacholine or albuterol

         17. Be pregnant or lactating

         18. Have participated in any other investigative drug study parallel to, or within 4 weeks
             of study entry

         19. Be an Investigator, site employee or otherwise be directly affiliated with the study
             site including being a member of the immediate family of an Investigator, site
             employee (where an immediate family member is defined as spouse, parent, child or
             sibling, whether biological or legally adopted or in foster care)

         20. Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30

         21. Have been diagnosed at Screening Visit (Visit 1) as definitively having or not having
             asthma; patients that will not continue in the study include those given the following
             diagnosis: asthma is extremely likely or definite (95 to 100% likelihood) or asthma is
             very unlikely or excluded (0 to &lt; 5% likelihood)

         22. Have previously been enrolled in this study at this or at any other clinical trials
             site

         23. Have previously received an Aridol challenge

         24. Have a clinically significantly abnormal chest x-ray
