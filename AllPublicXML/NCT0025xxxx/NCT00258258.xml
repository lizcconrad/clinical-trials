      RATIONALE: Paricalcitol may cause multiple myeloma cells to look more like normal cells, and
      to grow and spread more slowly. Paricalcitol may also stop the growth of the cancer cells by
      blocking blood flow to the cancer. Zoledronate may delay or prevent bone metastases in
      patients with multiple myeloma. Giving paricalcitol together with zoledronate may be an
      effective treatment for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of paricalcitol when
      given with zoledronate in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or
      other plasma cell disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paricalcitol when used with zoledronate in
           patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antimyeloma activity of paricalcitol in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of paricalcitol.

      Patients receive paricalcitol IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and zoledronate IV over
      15 minutes on day 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paricalcitol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
