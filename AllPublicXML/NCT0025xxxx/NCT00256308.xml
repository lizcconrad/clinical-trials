      Oxaliplatin-containing regimens have been safely and successfully used in combination with
      concurrent radiation in treatment of solid tumors such as rectal and esophageal cancers. The
      Lyon R0-04 phase II trial utilized the combination of Oxaliplatin, infusional 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU) and radiation in the treatment of rectal cancer. The trial showed a combined
      preoperative chemoradiotherapy and Oxaliplatin-containing regimen is well tolerated with no
      increase surgical toxicity. The good response rate observed warrants its use in further
      clinical trials.

      The combination of oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and radiation also have been used in a Phase I/II trial
      in esophageal cancer. In this particular trial, eligibility included therapeutically na√Øve
      esophageal cancer subjects with clinical disease stages II to IV. Initial doses and schedules
      for cycle 1 consisted of Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on days 1, 15, and 29; continuous infusion of
      5-FU 180 mg/m2 for 24 hours for 35 days; and radiation therapy (RT) 1.8 Gy in 28 fractions
      starting on day 8. At completion of cycle 1, eligible subjects could undergo an operation or
      begin cycle 2 without RT. Postoperative subjects were eligible for cycle 2. Stage IV subjects
      were allowed three cycles in the absence of disease progression. 38 subjects were treated (22
      stage IV, 16 stage II-III). 38 eligible subjects received therapy: 22 non-invasively staged
      as IV and 16 non-invasively staged as IV and 16 non-invasively staged as II and III. 36
      subjects completed cycle 1, 29 subjects started cycle 2, and 24 subjects completed cycle 2.
      The combined-modality therapy was well tolerated, but dose limiting toxicity (DLT) prevented
      Oxaliplatin and 5-FU escalation. No grade 4 hematologic toxicity was noted. Eleven grade 3
      and two grade 4 clinical toxicities were noted in eight subjects. After cycle 1, 29 subjects
      (81%) had no cancer in the esophageal mucosa. 13 subjects underwent an operation with intent
      to resect the esophagus and 5 subjects (38%) exhibited pathologic complete responses. There
      was no surgical mortality. Only 1 subject developed post-operative tracheoesphageal fistula.
      The results of these trials described above indicated that combination of oxaliplatin and
      radiation is safe and efficacious and dose not compromise surgical wound healing, repair and
      clinical outcome.

      Adjuvant treatment of resected head and neck cancers The incidence of locoregional failures
      and distant metastasis is high after primary resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck (HNSCC), especially in patients with unfavorable prognostic factors such as residual
      disease, histological evidence of extracapsular spread, and/or multiple neck nodes. RT is
      indicated as an adjuvant therapy to surgery. In the past 2 decades, RT was mainly delivered
      post-operatively, and the therapeutic gain with this combination is now well documented.
      Despite an overall 2-year freedom of recurrance of approximately of 70-75%, survival rates
      are usually poor in the whole HNSCC patient population, and they usually do not exceed 30 to
      35% at 5 years. The incidence of metastases in locally advanced but resectable head and neck
      cancer can reach 15 to 20%. The role of systemic chemotherapy has been tested in clinical
      trials to determine if the addition of chemotherapy can decrease locoregional and distant
      failure and improve survival.

      Oxaliplatin and radiation in solid tumors Oxalipaltin-containing regimens have been safely
      and successfully used in combination with concurrent radiation in treatment of solid tumors
      such as rectal and esophageal cancers. Results of previous trials indicated that combination
      of oxaliplatin and radiation is safe and efficacious and dose not compromise surgical wound
      healing, repair and clinical outcome.

      Oxaliplatin and radiation in head and neck cancer Oxaliplatin and radiation has been used in
      a randomized phase II study comparing standard radiation with or without weekly oxaliplatin
      in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation was administered at
      70-74 Gy to the primary tumor site, 60-64 Gy to the involved areas of the neck and 50 Gy to
      the uninvolved area of the neck. Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin at 70 mg/m2 was given weekly
      for 6 courses with standard radiation in the investigational arm. Interim results concurrent
      radiation with weekly oxaliplatin resulted in a higher complete response in the primary tumor
      site and in the cervical lymph nodes. There was no difference in the incidences of dry mouth,
      stomatitis, skin reaction, peripheral neuropathy or hematological toxicities between the 2
      treatment arms. Patients receiving the concurrent radiation and oxaliplatin treatment did
      experience more gastrointestinal toxicities mostly nausea and vomiting. The only grade 3
      toxicities are thrombocytopenia (5.1%), nausea/vomiting (12.8%) and skin reaction (25.6%).

      Microscopically involved margins, involvement of two or more nodes, extracapusular spread,
      presence of perineural involvement, and vascular embolisms are associated with an
      approximately 25% to 30% probability of developing locoregional failure. The addition of
      cisplatin to radiation reduces the locoregional failure and distant metastasis. We propose to
      investigate the toxicities of using weekly oxaliplatin with radiation in the treatment of
      high risk resected head and neck patients since oxaliplatin has a better side effects
      profile. The high risk factors will be the same criteria utilized in both RTOG 9501 and EORTC
      22931. They include microscopically involved margins, involvement of two or more nodes,
      extracapusular spread, presence of perineural involvement, vascular embolisms, and oral
      cavity or oropharyngeal carcinoma with lymph nodes metastasis at level IV or V.

Progression-free survival: from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease, death due to any cause or symptomatic deterioration
Progression: Appearance of any new lesion/site. The site of the new lesion will be recorded. Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration Symptomatic deterioration: Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression. Efforts should be made to obtain objective evidence of progression after discontinuation</description>
