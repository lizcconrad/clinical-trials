  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-year multicentre randomized controlled parallel trial to compare intentional delivery and
      conservative management in pregnant women with preterm and prelabour rupture of membranes
      between 32 and 35 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intentional delivery of women with PPROM
      between 32 and 35 week's gestation can decrease the overall neonatal morbidity associated
      with PPROM-related complications without increasing the morbidity associated with a shortened
      pregnancy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with recent PPROM between 31 weeks + 6 days and 35 weeks + 6 days (estimated
             gestational age based on an ultrasound examination before 18 weeks of gestation), not
             in labour 24 hours after admission*, will be considered eligible for the study
             provided the following inclusion criteria (*For patients transferred from a remote
             level 2 centre to one of the participating sites within the first hours after PPROM,
             the onset of the 24-hour screening period will be the time of admission in the centre
             of origin. Patients in Group A will be given their first dose of antenatal steroids
             before the transfer)

          -  Single and otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy

          -  Recent history (less than 48 hours) of leaking with the two followings within 24 hours
             after primary medical assessment: Documentation of fluid from the vagina and Positive
             Fern test, or positive Nitrazine test, or Positive ACTIM PROM test

          -  Antenatal steroids course initiated after the rupture for women with PPROM between 31
             + 6 and 33 + 6 weeks

          -  Normal fetal heart rate trace using an external ultrasound transducer

          -  Written informed consent obtained before inclusion and randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple pregnancy

          -  HIV positive mother

          -  Active HSV cervical lesions

          -  Major fetal anomaly on ultrasound examination performed after admission

          -  Intrauterine growth restriction estimated on ultrasound below the 5th percentile or
             preeclampsia

          -  Placenta abruption present at the time of the diagnosis of PPROM or occurring within
             the first 24 hours after rupture

          -  Clinical chorioamnionitis existing before or at the time of the diagnosis of PPROM or
             developing within the first 24 hours after rupture

          -  Non-reassuring fetal testing present at the time of the diagnosis of PPROM or
             occurring within the first 24 hours after the rupture. It implies that expected
             criteria for standard fetal assessment parameters have not been met, including the
             Non-Stress test and the Biophysical profile Score. This will be diagnosed at the
             discretion of the attending physician.

          -  More generally, any maternal or fetal reason for an immediate delivery, either
             existing at admission or occurring within the 24 hours after admission.

          -  Mother refusal or inability to provide consent
