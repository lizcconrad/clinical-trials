  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigator initated study is to examine the effect of OMACOR (Omega-3-acid
      ethyl ester 90) on the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients
      undergoing chronic hemodialysis, who has previously experienced a cardiovascular event.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal failure have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and increased
      premature mortality. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish are known to have
      cardioprotective effects in subects with normal renal function. The aim of present study is
      to examine the effect of OMACOR (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 90) on the incidence of
      cardiovascular events and mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, who has
      previously experienced a cardiovascular event.

      Design: A prospective, randomised, placebo controlled study. 2 year treatment period.
