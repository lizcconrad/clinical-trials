      Hypothesis: Use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) decreases the incidence of fractures in
      early postmenopausal women.

      The project was initiated in 1990, and the inclusion ended in 1993. A total of 2,016 early
      postmenopausal women were divided into two groups: The first group accepted randomisation to
      HRT or not, and the second group was allowed to choose HRT or not.

      The study was not blinded. Main measurements were fracture risk over 20 years, changes in
      bone mineral density over 20 years, and side effects, mainly breast cancer.

      Aim: To study the ability of hormone replacement early after menopause on risk of fractures
      and changes in bone mineral density, and side effects.

      The project was designed as a comprehensive cohort trial. One group accepted randomisation,
      and was randomised to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or not (no placebo used).

      502 were randomised to HRT, and 504 were randomised to no HRT) One group was allowed to
      choose HRT or not. A total of 221 chose HRT, and 789 chose no HRT.

      First line HRT was oral sequential oestradiol/norethisterone in women with intact uterus and
      oral continuous oestradiol in hysterectomised women.

      The study was initiated in 1990, and inclusion ended in 1993.
