      To determine the primary end point response rate of the combinations of Gemcitabine and
      Oxaliplatin (Gem-Ox) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with
      platelet counts greater 100,000 per microliter in a single arme Phase II trial.

      To determine the toxicity profile of this regimen To determine the effect of this treatment
      on patient survival, time to treatment failure, time ot progression, time to response.

      The treatment plan is a two-step design. Day 1 the pt will receive Gemcitabine IV and Day 2
      the pt will receive Oxaliplatin IV. This treatment cycle is repeated approximately every 28
      days. Subsequent treatment cycle dosages are based on toxicity diaries and lab work results.
      CT scans are repeated every 2 treatment cycles. Continuation in the study is dependent upon
      tumor response.
