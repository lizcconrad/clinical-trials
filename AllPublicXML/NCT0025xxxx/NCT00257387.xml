    <textblock>
      Evaluate the incidence of acute rejection at 12 months after transplantation in subjects
      receiving induction therapy with cyclosporine microemulsion (CsA) and Rapamune followed by
      CsA dose reduction (Phase I) with subjects receiving induction therapy with CsA and Rapamune
      followed by CsA discontinuation (Phase II) in Chinese de novo renal allograft recipients.
