  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed for patients with non small cell lung cancer whose cancer is too
      advanced and therefore cannot be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. At
      this stage of the disease, most patients cannot be cured from the disease, however, treatment
      can help to live longer and better by keeping the cancer under control. For that purpose,
      patients traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both treatments in
      succession. Recently, the administration of both treatment methods given concurrently showed
      somewhat better results when compared to successive administration. In some studies the drug
      Taxotere together with radiation performed well in keeping the cancer better under control.

      Combination of the drug Taxotere together with a compound called 5-FU either as continuous
      infusion or in its oral form of a pill called &quot;Xeloda&quot; enhanced its anti cancer activity
      substantially.

      One goal of this study is to investigate how much of the combination can be given in
      conjunction with chest radiation. Using X-rays, the study will also evaluate how much
      shrinkage of the cancer is caused by this treatment directly at the tumor site and other
      areas where the cancer may have also spread.

      In this study the radiation will be given on only one day per week in two sessions, rather
      than divided over five days per week (Monday through Friday) as it is more commonly used.
      However, both schedules have been found to be equally effective.

      The treatment program will use increasing doses of the 5-FU medication, either as infusion or
      as pill to find the highest dose that is tolerated. Once the highest tolerated dose is
      determined, subsequent patients who will be enrolled will continue to be treated at that dose
      level. The dose of the drug Taxotere will remain the same throughout.

      Hypothesis: Our previous research suggests that the combination of Taxotere and 5-FU given
      together with weekly chest radiation will provide a more convenient form of treatment than
      the conventional approach and also be at least similar in its efficacy.

      The original once weekly hypofractionated chest irradiation protocol descrived by Salazar et
      al. will be followed with a slight modification. The dose will be split in two fractions,
      which will be given 6 hours apart. We found that this fractionation in two doses reduces
      radiation-related side effects. Treatment will be given to a large field with a 2-3 cm tumor
      margin. All involved or suspicious nodal areas will be radiated as well. A total of 12
      treatments will be administered in weekly. Total treatment will be 6000 cGy. Radiation
      treatment will be administered within 2 hours of Taxotere infusion.

      All patients will receive a fixed dose of Taxotere of 25 mg/m2 once per week on the day of
      radiotherapy preceeding the radiation. All patients will be premedicated using standard
      antiemetics and Decadron (8 mg po 12 hours prior Taxotere, 1 mg Kytril po, 20 mg Decadron iv
      , 50 mg Benadryl iv and 20 mg Pepcid iv , all 30 min prior Taxotere).

      A dose escalation of 5-FU or Xeloda will be employed. 5-FU will be given as continuous
      infusion, Xeloda orally Monday through Friday throughout the 12 weeks of radiation. Upon
      reaching the maximum tolerated dose, the remainder of patients will be treated at the
      5-FU/Xeloda dose level below the MTD.

      Patients for who are unable to tolerate oral Xeloda because of the size of the tablets or
      difficulties with their upper gastroiontestinal tract or for whom Xeloda cannot be obtained,
      the intravenous equivalent of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) will be administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion. Patients who started out on Xeloda and during the treatment experience
      difficulties in continuing taking Xeloda maybe switched to a biological equivalent dose of
      5-FU during the treatment. The 5-FU dose range administered in lieu of Xeloda will be
      administered and adjustments will be made in 50 mg/m2/day steps as previously pubished by
      Lokich et al.
