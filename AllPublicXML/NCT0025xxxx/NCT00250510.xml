  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to simulate what would occur if insurance reimbursement became
      available for obesity treatment but required that the individual meet defined performance
      milestones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to determine whether a reimbursement incentive (the prospect of
      reimbursement of half of the out-of-pocket fee for participation in the UAB EatRight Weight
      Management Program, when it is contingent upon consistent Program participation and loss of
      6% of initial body weight) is associated with (1) a higher rate of Program enrollment and (2)
      greater percent weight loss, greater reductions in medication dosages and costs, and fewer
      visits to health care providers after 12 weeks and 9 months.
