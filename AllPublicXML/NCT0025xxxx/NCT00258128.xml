  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We believe that diet induced obesity leads to activation of the IKK/NF-kB inflamatory pathway
      and that chronic inflammation leads to insulin resistance and diabetes. In rodents,
      salicylates inhibit IKK/NF-kB and may improve insulin sensitivity. We will study if this is
      true in people.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        age 18 to 65 years, inclusive; HbA1c &gt;6.0% (off medication-diabetic) normal hemoglobin and
        hematocrit, without donation of blood in the previous 2 months; without involvement in any
        study evaluating an investigational drug or device for the previous 2 months; normal
        clotting studies; female postmenopausal or surgically sterile, or using barrier or oral
        contraception and with a negative pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        pregnant or lactating women; patients with persistent ketonuria or a history of
        ketoacidosis (suggesting the need for insulin therapy); current of previous use of insulin
        for glucose control; patients with abnormal liver function defined as elevation of
        bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, or GGTP more than 1.5 times the upper limit of
        normal; patients with kidney disease (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL) macroalbuminuria (1+
        protein on a standard urine dip-stick, or &gt; 300 mg urinary albumin/day)- (patients with
        microalbuminuria will be enrolled); patients with any significant diseases or conditions,
        including emotional or psychiatric disorders and substance abuse, including history of
        binge drinking, that, in the opinion of the investigator, are likely to alter the patient's
        ability to complete the study; patients with metabolic acidosis (abnormal anion gap);
        history of gastric ulcer, dyspepsia, or upper or lower GI bleed; history of allergy to
        aspirin, or bleeding diathesis or currently on oral anticoagulants including warfarin,
        heparin, aspirin or other NSAIDs; patients with major vascular event within 6 months of
        screening for the study (e.g., myocardial infarction stroke, coronary artery bypass graft
        (CABG) surgery, angioplasty, peripheral vascular surgery); patients with chronic heart
        disease, or a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Symptomatic angina pectoris or
        cardiac insufficiency as defined by the NYHA; classification as Functional Class III or IV;
        patients with HbA1C &gt; 13% (normal range 4-6%); patients who smoke more than one pack of
        cigarettes daily; patients taking treatment medications known to affect insulin sensitivity
        (e.g. diuretics, beta-blockers); patients taking warfarin, heparin or NSAID on a chronic
        basis; patients with inadequately controlled serum lipid levels (total cholesterol ≥ 275
        mg/dL and fasting triglycerides ≥ 450 mg/dL); patients with history of cancer within 5
        years prior to screening for the study other than basal cell carcinoma; active alcohol or
        other substance abuse.
