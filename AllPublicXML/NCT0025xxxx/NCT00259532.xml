    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate and compare three new methods for diagnosis,
      staging, operability evaluation and treatment control of pancreas cancer. The investigators
      use contrast-enhanced ultrasound combined with the gastrointestinal hormones Secretin and
      Cholecystokinin, which triggers the enzyme production of pancreas. The hormones induce an
      increased metabolism and thus an increased blood flow through healthy pancreas tissue,
      however, not in tumor tissue. The investigators hope to be able to use this effect
      diagnostically. The patients included will also have a 64-slice-CT in order to evaluate, if
      an increased diagnostic safety can be reached compared to an older CT scanning method. All
      patients will also be examined for the tumor marker CA 19-9. Further, the investigators will
      examine if contrast-enhanced ultrasound can contribute with information in treatment control
      after either surgery or medical treatment.
