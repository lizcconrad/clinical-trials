    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a specific protocol of sEMG-BFB in upper
      limb hemiparesis added to conventional physical therapy on changes in upper extremity
      functionality, motor recruitment pattern and range of motion (ROM) compared to the single
      application of conventional physical therapy. It aims to find a 22.22% difference between
      both interventions.

      Upper limb hemiparesis is a common consequence after brain damage.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a specific protocol of surface electromyographic
      biofeedback (sEMG-BFB) and conventional physical therapy in upper limb functionality, muscle
      recruitment changes, and glenohumeral range of motion compared to the single application of
      conventional physical therapy.

      Design: randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Sample: 40 participants from State Center of Attention to Brain Injury were recruited.

      Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups where the experimental group
      received sEMG-BFB for the upper trapezius and middle deltoid muscles of the upper limb with
      hemiparesis and the control group received a placebo of the same technique. Both treatments
      were applied for 6 weeks. The score of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity&quot; for
      functionality and shoulder range of motion were objectified. Root mean square (RMS) value was
      assessed as a secondary measure Data were collected before and after intervention.

      A protocol of sEMG-BFB in upper limb may have an important role in the recovery of subjects
      with upper limb hemiparesis.

    <description>protocol of sEMG-BFB that consisted of active movements in glenohumeral abduction guided by the visual signal of the register equipment. The protocol was the following: firstly proof active movements were requested in glenohumeral abduction without feeling any pain in order to teach the visual signal of their muscle activity. The therapist dedicated around 10 minutes in each session for subject learned to control the activation of both muscles in the limits that physical therapist marked with each individual in particular (controlling the activation in the upper trapezius). Once integrated information, shoulder abduction were requested following 4 main principles.</description>

    <description>consisted of Sham-EMG biofeedback, in which the electrodes were placed as the same method as the EG (Fig. 2) but the screen emit no signal. The subject performed 3 sequences of 10 abduction contractions (first degrees) without pain feeling and with 5 minutes of rest between sequences.</description>

    <description>All participants received a conventional daily treatment of neurological physical therapy. Since no evidence has been found about a specific therapy that specially could benefit hemiparesis consequences, the common approach in this center consists of a combination of different specific concepts (Bobath, Brunnstrom, Rood, Johnstone, Propioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation, Perfetti, Vojta, Motor Relearning Programme,…), exercise programs, electrotherapy, myofascial techniques, etc…</description>
