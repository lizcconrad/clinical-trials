  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms of OCTN1 and OCT2 and
      other possible covariates on the kinetic disposition of GAB in patients undergoing GAB
      chronic treatment. Thus, patients treated with GAB, for at least one week, are being
      investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin (GAB), an anticonvulsant used for the treatment of epilepsy and chronic pain, has
      nonlinear kinetics, it is not metabolized and it is mainly eliminated by renal excretion.
      Studies suggest that the renal excretion of GAB is dependent on active secretion by organic
      cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and organic cation/ergothioneine transporter 1 (OCTN1). These
      transporters are expressed at the membrane of the renal proximal tubules and they are
      involved in the elimination of endogenous compounds and many drugs. The genetic polymorphism
      of drug transporters has been studied to explain the kinetic disposition variability of their
      substrates. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of genetic
      polymorphisms of OCTN1 and OCT2 and other possible covariates (e.g., sex, age, creatinine
      clearance, body mass index) on the kinetic disposition of GAB in patients undergoing GAB
      chronic treatment. Patients treated with GAB, for at least one week, are being investigated.
      Blood and urine samples are being collected to GAB pharmacokinetic analysis, serum creatinine
      analysis and for genotyping. The plasma concentration of GAB will be assessed using liquid
      chromatography with UV detection (LC-UV).
