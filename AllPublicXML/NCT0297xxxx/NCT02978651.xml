      The first objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of pitolisant
      given at 10, 20, or 40 mg per day versus placebo during 12 weeks of the Double Blind period,
      to treat the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      (OSA) refusing the nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) therapy or treated by
      nCPAP but still complaining of EDS.

      The secondary objectives of the study include assessing the long-term tolerance as well as
      the maintenance of efficacy of pitolisant given at 10, 20 or 40 mg per day during 39 weeks of
      Open Label Extension period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female outpatients aged from at least 18 years.

          -  Patients complaining of EDS refusing to be treated by nCPAP therapy or having been
             submitted to nCPAP therapy for a minimum period of 3 months, and still complaining of
             EDS despite the efforts made beforehand to obtain an efficient nCPAP therapy.

          -  Polysomnography performed (for patients submitted to nCPAP therapy - under nCPAP)
             between V1 and V2 or during the last 12 months with Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI): for
             patients without nCPAP therapy ≥ 15; for patients under nCPAP therapy less or equal to
             10.

          -  For patients submitted to nCPAP therapy: nCPAP ≥ 4 hours / day (compliance checked on
             the clock-time counter of the CPAP machine)

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥ 28
