  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate whether patients at advanced age are fluid responders
      via a reversible fluid challenge, the passive leg raise test. This will be measured with a
      non-invasive cardiac output monitor, the LiDCO (LiDCO Hemodynamic monitoring) .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is as simple as a passive leg raise with measurement of effect on Stroke
      volume.

    <description>The patient is placed in a 45 degree recumbent position. Stroke volume is measured in ml.
Intervention:The patient is placed horizontal and the legs are passively raised to 45 degrees.
Measurement:The effect of the PLR on Stroke Volume is measured. Thereafter the patient is repositioned to the initial position and Stroke Volume is measured again.</description>

    <description>By tilting the patient's bed from sitting 45 degrees to supine with legs tilted up 45 degrees we recruit the blood volume in the legs and can measure a reversible fluid challenge on stroke volume.</description>
