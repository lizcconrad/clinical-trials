    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) combined with virtual leg
      illumination (provided through a wearable headset (OculusRift, OculusVR, Irvine, CA) and a
      custom-designed virtual reality leg scenario) will lead to controlled analgesia induction,
      boosting analgesic effects obtained with standard SCS treatments and will further be
      associated with changes in the perception of the affected body part.

    <textblock>
      Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an approved treatment for truncal and extremity
      neuropathic pain. The mechanisms underlying the efficacy of SCS are unknown. Recent advances
      in cognitive neuroprosthetics using virtual reality allow for modulation of body perception
      and bodily experience, which has also been shown to modulate pain perception. The present
      research proposal plans to merge expertise in cognitive neuroprosthetics with neuromodulation
      techniques in order to test the analgesic properties of the combination of epidural spinal
      cord stimulation with a new system of multisensory stimulation based on virtual and enhanced
      reality (i.e., neuro-visual stimulation). The investigators propose to study this hypothesis
      prospectively in 25 patients with implanted SCS systems for the treatment of chronic
      neuropathic pain. Primary outcomes will be pain reduction (based on subjective, functional
      and physiological measures) and changes in body perception (based on subjective and objective
      measures). The present study will generate a proof-of-concept for the application of
      neuro-visual stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain and will form the basis for future
      NIH funding application.

    <description>Subjective pain perception will be measured by pain ratings on a 10cm visual continuous analog scale (VAS). Patients will be ask to rate their pain, ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; (bottom part of the scale) to &quot;the worst imaginable pain&quot; (upper part of the scale) (Huskisson 1974).</description>

    <description>Validated questionnaires developed by the collaborators (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) will be used in order to investigate induced changes in leg perception and ownership. In particular, we will assess: 1) feeling of ownership towards the leg shown in the virtual reality set-up (leg ownership); 2) tactile sensations felt on the virtual legs, depending on the different conditions of SCS and visual stimulation. Patients will be asked to indicate how much they agreed with each item using a 7-point colored vertical Likert scale ranging from 0 (complete disagreement, the bottom extreme, red point) to +6 (complete agreement, the top extreme, green point).</description>

    <description>Participants in this study will be adults who have already undergone implantation of SCS for the treatment of their pain conditions. The study involves no further treatment or intervention. Subjects will be approached for participation in this study during their routine postoperative clinical visit to the Center for Neuromodulation at the Ohio State University (OSU).All eligible patients will undergo a one-day visit for the virtual reality and full body illusion intervention. This research will also investigate leg embodiment and leg analgesic effects during SCS integrated with different patterns of virtual leg illumination.</description>
