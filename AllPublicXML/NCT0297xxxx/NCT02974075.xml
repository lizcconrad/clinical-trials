  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite continuous technical improvements in urologic surgery, up to 40% of prostate cancer
      patients will develop biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP), potentially
      because of micro metastasis at the time of the primary surgery.

      With improved radiological modalities and nuclear medicine tracers like 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT,
      which allow the localization of the site of recurrence, there is increasing interest in
      metastasis directed therapies, such as salvage lymph node dissection.

      The pelvic extended salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) is a promising option for treating
      prostate cancer patients with local recurrence after radical prostatectomy with curative
      intent. Several retrospective series has been published to determine the local value of sLND.
      Despite the first data seem to be feasible and promising, to date no prospective evaluation
      has been made. Thus sLND is still experimental according to the guidelines and is considered
      as an off label therapy.

      This prospective single center phase I/II study was conducted to investigate the safety and
      early efficacy of salvage lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients with local pelvic
      recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intention.
