    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a nutrient dense plant rich (NDPR)
      diet compared to a standard USDA diet on glycemic control, inflammation, and cardiovascular
      risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the nutrient dense plant rich (NDPR) diet will eat foods with high micronutrient density, and favorable glycemic index. The diet is low in saturated fat, high in fiber, and rich in phytochemicals. Total caloric intake will range from 1600-2000/day based on individual needs. Foods include vegetables (30-70% of calories), fruits (15-20% of calories), Beans/Legumes (20-30% of calories), raw nuts and seeds (10-20% of calories), fish or fat-free dairy (twice weekly or less), poultry, eggs and oils (once weekly or less) and limited beef, cheese/milk, processed food and beef.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the healthy U.S.-Style pattern diet will eat the types and proportions of foods Americans typically consume, but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. It is designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components. Total caloric intake will range from 1600-2000/day based on individual needs. Foods include fruits, vegetables (dark green, red/orange, beans, and peas, starchy vegetables), grains (whole grains and refined grains), protein foods (meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, seeds and soy products), dairy, and oils.</description>
