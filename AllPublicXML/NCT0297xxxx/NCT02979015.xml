      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single SC doses of alirocumab in Chinese
      healthy subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single SC dose of alirocumab.

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of a single SC dose of alirocumab on low-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other lipid parameters.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of a single SC dose of alirocumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ascending dose design includes 3 dose levels. Tolerance data up to at least 14 days post
      dosing from at least 6 subjects of the previous cohort will be reviewed before proceeding
      with a next dose. Total duration of the study per subject is approximately 15 weeks
      (including screening period).
