      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary
      efficacy of the investigational drug PLX3397 in subjects with unresectable or metastatic
      KIT-mutated melanoma.

    <description>An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not it is considered to be study drug related. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
SAEs are events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning. Clear progression of the underlying cancer and hospitalizations due to the progression of cancer should not be reported as an adverse event, or a serious adverse event.</description>
