  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether bifurcation stenting guided by
      on-line three-dimensional optical frequency domain imaging (3D-OFDI) is superior to that with
      angiographic guidance by measuring incomplete stent apposition (ISA) in the bifurcation
      segment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recently developed optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) can provide high quality
      resolution images of the coronary arteries. This new imaging system enhances the
      understanding of complex coronary lesions and the complex interaction between coronary
      devices and vessels by assembling/compiling 2-dimensional cross sections.

      This 3-dimensional reconstruction with strut segmentation becomes possible on-line in the
      TERUMO OFDI console with 3-dimensional imaging software, which enables stent enhancement and
      3D reconstruction within one minute. This &quot;real time&quot; 3D OFDI will promote the utilisation of
      3-dimensional assessment in the treatment of bifurcation lesions.

    <description>Subjects randomized to 3D-guidance arm will undergo optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) assessment in the main vessel after re-wiring into the jailed side branch following stent implantation. If the position of the wire is not located in the optimal cell, further attempts to redirect the wire to the optimal cell will be performed, with subsequent OFDI acquisitions to confirm position in 2D and off-line 3D reconstruction. After procedure, OFDI is performed in the main branch.</description>
