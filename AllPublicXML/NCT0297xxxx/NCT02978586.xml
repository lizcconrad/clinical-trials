  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance
      imaging (PET/MRI) can be used to monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatment using an
      investigational radioactive drug called [Ga-68]PSMA.

      Primary Objective

      The primary objective of this pilot imaging study is to determine the feasibility of using
      positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance (PET/MR) with [Ga-68] prostate-specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA) for staging and treatment monitoring of PSMA expressing tumors.
      [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR findings will be compared with standard of care imaging, patient follow
      up, and histopathology if available. [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR will not be used to change the
      patients' treatment plan. Investigators will assess PET/MR test-retest reproducibility and
      compare baseline [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR with PET/MR after initiation (within 2-6 weeks) of
      therapy and evaluate if [Ga-68]PSMA is a suitable biomarker for treatment monitoring and
      assessment of early treatment response.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare early changes in PET biomarker ([Ga-68]PSMA) tumor uptake with treatment
           response assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).

        -  To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment
           response assessed at completion of therapy.

        -  To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with [Ga-68]PSMA uptake.

        -  To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics.

      Study Design Patients, who enroll in this study, will undergo a baseline [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR
      to assess the level of [Ga-68]PSMA tumor uptake. Patients with positive [Ga-68]PSMA tumor
      uptake (defined as [Ga-68]PSMA uptake twice the background activity) who are receiving
      systemic therapy will undergo a further [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR 2-6 weeks after start of
      treatment. Patients with positive [Ga-68]PSMA tumor uptake will also be offered to
      participate in a test- retest study with a 2nd [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR prior to treatment.
      Patients will therefore undergo a maximum of three [Ga-68]PSMA PET/MR imaging procedures. The
      first two test-retest Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI will be performed on separate days to allow for
      radioactive decay. There will be no other (e.g. clinically indicated) PET scan performed on
      the same day of [Ga-68]PSMA-PET/MRI.

    <description>Standard morphologic imaging will be obtained in a target area harboring tumor tissue before and after treatment. Quantitative parameters will be obtained in the respective techniques by drawing a region of interest (ROI) in the tumor lesions using dedicated post processing software and interactive workstations. Relative and absolute differences in tumor signal intensities and quantitative parameters will be calculated between pre-treatment PET vs. PET after initiation of therapy. These differences will be compared with treatment response at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response) as assessed by standard of care imaging</description>
