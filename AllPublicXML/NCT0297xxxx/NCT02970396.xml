  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigation of adult individuals with epilepsy, and involves educational and
      behavioral interventions intended to enhance treatment adherence and self-management.

      The investigators are adapting a self-management intervention that they developed in a
      previous study to individuals with epilepsy and a history of negative health events (NHEs),
      such as accidents and emergency department (ED) visits, diminished quality of life and poor
      mental well-being. The intervention &quot;Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history
      of negative health events (SMART)&quot; is intended to reduce NHEs and improve quality of life in
      people with epilepsy associated with historically disadvantaged groups.
