  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are insufficient published studies on amino acid requirements in the elderly.
      Phenylalanine is one of the indispensable amino acids. Low levels of phenylalanine has been
      observed in in the blood of older adults. It is due the increased uptake by the liver and
      intestine. This decreased levels of phenylalanine could lead to decreased skeletal muscle
      protein synthesis. Requirement for elderly individuals have been set based on studies
      conducted in younger adults hence may be inaccurate. The goal of this study is to directly
      measure the phenylalanine requirement of male and female elderly subjects over 65 years using
      the direct amino acid oxidation (DAAO) technique.

      1. To determine and compare the phenylalanine requirement of healthy elderly male and
           female adults over the age of 65 years using the DAAO technique (by measuring the
           oxidation of L-[1-13 C] phenylalanine to 13 CO 2 [F 13 CO 2] ) in response to graded
           intakes of phenylalanine.

        2. To compare the requirement so derived to that of young healthy adult previously
           determined in our lab.
