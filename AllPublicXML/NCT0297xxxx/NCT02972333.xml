      Patients with confirmed EGFR T790M positive NSCLC who have received prior therapy with an
      EGFR-TKI and concurrent with brain metastasis will be enrolled into the study. All eligible
      patients will have access to AZD9291 regimen through the ASTRIS study as long as they
      continue to show clinical benefit.
