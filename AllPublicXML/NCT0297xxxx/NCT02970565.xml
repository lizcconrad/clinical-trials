  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to investigate the efficacy of a group model of Family
      Nurture Intervention in ameliorating behavioral problems in preschool-aged children. The
      behavioral, neurobiological and clinical insights gained from this project may eventually
      lead to better treatment of emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders. The
      investigator hypothesizes that the children who are treated with Family Nurture Intervention
      (FNI), which incorporates interactive touch with vocal soothing, and family practice in
      comforting, will show increased emotional connection and mother child co-regulation with
      better results in the outcome measures in the short term and long term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several early intervention programs that are available for children with emotional,
      behavioral and developmental disorders, ranging from behavioral treatment and sensory
      exposure therapy to pharmaceutical treatments. Although improvements in behavior have
      resulted from these interventions, they are limited in numerous ways. They are usually
      time-consuming, both for the child and the teacher or clinician providing the intervention.
      In order to see an effect of the intervention, most children must engage in the intervention
      procedure for several years. Moreover, the effects of most current intervention procedures
      are minimal to moderate. Pharmaceutical prescriptions are often accompanied by undesirable
      side effects that may modulate behavior, emotion, and physiological functions. The
      behavioral, neurobiological and clinical insights gained from this project may eventually
      lead to better treatment of emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders.

    <measure>Change in Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a device by which parents or other individuals who know the child well rate a child's problem behaviors and competencies. This instrument can either be self-administered or administered through an interview. The CBCL can also be used to measure a child's change in behavior over time or following a treatment. The first section of this questionnaire consists of 20 competence items and the second section consists of 120 items on behavior or emotional problems.</description>

    <measure>Co-regulation of Vagal Tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using ECG data obtained during each follow-up visit, the investigators will characterize various parameters of cardiac function and regulation including assessments of parasympathetic modulation of heart rate. Long term individual differences in attention and emotional regulation are correlated with these parameters. Heart rate and respiration obtained from analogue outputs from standard clinical monitors or from specially designed hardware utilized routinely in the studies of human infants. The digitized recordings of ECG and respiration will be processed using software designed specifically for displaying, marking, and analyzing data from these records.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Welch Emotional Connection Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinical tool to assess the emotional connectedness of a mother-child dyad. The aim of the WECS is to assess behaviors observed during mother-child interaction, and score these behavioral observations across four domains to better inform health professionals of a dyad's interventional need. This scale will be completed by study staff.</description>
