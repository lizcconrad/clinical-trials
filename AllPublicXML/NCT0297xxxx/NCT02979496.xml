  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily intake of orange pomace on
      gastrointestinal function as measured by stool frequency. Additional outcomes will include
      aspects of digestive health, diet quality, and fasting blood glucose and lipid
      concentrations. Possible explanations for the mechanism of the pomace will be explored in
      microbial ecology analyses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, healthy adults will be asked to consume
      daily servings of orange juice containing either 0 g (n=120; control) or 180 g (i.e. 10 g
      fiber; n=120) of orange pomace for 3 weeks to assess the effect of the pomace on stool
      frequency. Blood samples will be obtained to assess the effect of the pomace on metabolic
      markers. Stool samples will be collected for analyses of the effect of the pomace on fecal
      bacteria known to be associated with health benefits (e.g., bifidobacteria). For exploratory
      analyses, additional groups will be asked to consume orange juice containing 90 g of pomace
      (i.e. 5 g fiber; n=40) or orange-flavored, calorie-matched water (n=40); outcomes from the
      water group will be compared to those of the 0 g pomace juice group to assess any effects of
      the juice alone, and outcomes from the 90 g pomace group will be compared to those of the 180
      g and 0 g groups in microbiota analyses.
