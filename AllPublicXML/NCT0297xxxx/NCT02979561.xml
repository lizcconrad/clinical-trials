    <description>All patients in this group continue to receive unfractionated heparin for 5-7 days, and then transferred to the drug Pradaxa dose of 150 mg 2 times a day. Pradaxa administration continued until the end of the treatment period. The treatment period starts on the day of randomization and lasts for 6 months.</description>

    <description>all patients continue to receive unfractionated heparin intravenously and at the same time (from the date of randomization) start warfarin, accompanied by regular measurement of the INR every day or every other day. As soon as INR reaches the range of 2.0 to 3.0, the administration of the unfractionated heparin should be discontinued. Further measurements of INR should be performed once a month during outpatient visits. The patient continues to receive warfarin under the control of the INR till the end of the treatment period. The treatment period starts on the day of randomization and lasts for 6 months.</description>
