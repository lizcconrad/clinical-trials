  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have undergone gastrectomy (removal of the stomach) to treat or prevent cancer
      are known to have a significantly reduced quality of life. To date, there is very little
      information on the physiological causes of this. The investigators suspect that
      overproduction of a hormone (chemical) called glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released by the
      lining of the gut may play a role in the reduced appetite, weight loss and low blood sugar
      symptoms seen in this group. To investigate this, the investigators will study the response
      of 16 patients who have previously had a gastrectomy to a glucose drink, and a meal, while
      receiving an infusion of a specific blocker of GLP-1 or placebo. The investigators will
      examine the levels of sugar and associated hormones in the blood, food consumption and food
      reward behaviour using standard tools.

      Participants will be invited to attend the Clinical Research Facility at Addenbrooke's
      Hospital for a screening visit, and two whole day study visits. The study has been designed
      to assess the role of overproduction of GLP-1 by completely blocking its actions, rather than
      assess the use of the blocking compound as a medication, and is therefore regarded as a
      physiological study, not a clinical trial.

      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the magnitude of effect of GLP-1 on blood sugar and
      appetite derangement in patients who have had a gastrectomy. This will guide future work on
      the development of novel treatment paradigms for the post-gastrectomy patient group.
