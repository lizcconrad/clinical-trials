  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the need for more affordable hepatitis C virus (HCV) antivirals with high barriers
      to viral resistance and strategies to shorten the current treatment duration, the goal is to
      develop affordable therapeutic regimens to prevent HCV entry/spread and test the efficacy of
      those inhibitors for treating HCV infection. The investigators recently discovered that a
      major cholesterol uptake receptor is required for HCV entry into hepatocytes and that there
      is already an FDA-approved drug that inhibits cholesterol uptake by this receptor.
      Importantly the same drug also potently blocks HCV entry in human liver cells both in cell
      culture and in a small animal model. Further, looking back at people who were previously
      treated for HCV infection, the investigators found treatment response to be better (i.e.
      larger viral log reduction) in patients who happened to be taking ezetimibe (EZE). Hence, the
      objective of this study is to assess whether the FDA-approved drug (ezetimibe) is useful for
      the treatment of chronic HCV. The investigators predict that when administered as monotherapy
      ezetimibe will reduce HCV viremia perhaps allowing for viral clearance and that when included
      in combination treatment regimens that EZE will increase HCV decline resulting in faster
      viral clearance (i.e. shorter/cheaper direct-acting antiviral [DAA] therapy). To test these
      hypotheses, the investigators will execute the following aims: (1) Assess the efficacy of EZE
      monotherapy in chronically HCV infected and predict time to cure; (2) Assess the efficacy of
      EZE as an adjunct therapy in chronically HCV infected patients undergoing currently approved
      HCV DAA treatment.

      To address the need for more affordable HCV antivirals with high barriers to viral resistance
      and/or strategies to shorten the current treatment duration, the goal is to develop
      affordable therapeutic regimens to prevent HCV entry/spread and test the efficacy of those
      inhibitors for treating HCV infection. The investigators recently discovered that the
      Niemann-Pick C1 Like-1 (NPC1L1) cellular cholesterol uptake receptor is required for HCV
      entry into hepatocytes and that ezetimibe, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits NPC1L1-mediated
      cholesterol uptake potently blocks HCV entry in human hepatoma cells and human hepatocytes
      transplanted into urokinase-type plasminogen activator-severe combined immunodeficiency
      (uPA-SCID) mice. Further, retrospective analysis of the National VA database using
      multivariable logistic regression models to control for age, sex, race, alcohol use, drug
      use, and other co-morbidities, the investigators found HCV prevalence to be lower (p &lt;.001)
      and interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV) treatment response to be better (i.e. larger viral log
      reduction) in patients taking ezetimibe. Hence, the specific objective of this application is
      to assess the efficacy of EZE for the treatment of chronic HCV. Based on preliminary in
      vitro, in vivo, clinical retrospective data and HCV/DAA modeling, the investigators
      hypothesize that when administered as monotherapy EZE will reduce HCV viremia perhaps
      allowing for viral clearance and that when included in combination treatment regimens that
      EZE will augment 2nd phase HCV decline resulting in faster viral clearance (i.e.
      shorter/cheaper DAA therapy). To test these hypotheses, the investigators will execute the
      following aims: (1) Assess the efficacy of EZE monotherapy in chronically HCV infected and
      predict time to cure; (2) Assess the efficacy of EZE as an adjunct therapy in chronically HCV
      infected patients undergoing currently approved HCV DAA treatment.
