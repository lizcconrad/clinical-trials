    <textblock>
      Dabrafenib and trametinib are drugs that are usually given for the treatment of melanoma.
      Combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib have also been studied and when used together have
      shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. Dabrafenib and
      trametinib have also shown potential to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier when given together
      and have an effect on brain metastases. Giving these drugs at the same time and then giving
      brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may also be preferred in patients with brain metastases

      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of giving dabrafenib in combination with
      trametinib continuously with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) has on melanoma and brain
      metastases.

      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a non-surgical radiation therapy used to treat tumours of
      the brain. It can deliver precisely targeted radiation. Currently SRS alone is the usual
      treatment for patients with up to 4 brain lesions. This study will include 2 groups 1)
      patients with 1-4 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib
      and 2) patients with 5-10 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and
      trametinib.
