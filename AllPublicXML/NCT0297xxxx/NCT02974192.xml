  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases and constitutes a major cause of
      death and disability in industrial world. Inflammation has been reported to constitute a
      major component of ischemic stroke pathology. The brain responds to ischemic injury with an
      acute andprolonged inflammatory process. Few studies have investigated the relationship
      between acute biomarkers of inflammation and functional outcome following stroke

      This case -control observational prospective study will be conducted on 100 patients with
      first -ever acute onset ischemic stroke within 24-48 hours. Their ages ranged-years old (mean
      age ±years). All participants will be subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical and
      neurological examination. Complete neurological examination where the following clinical and
      demographical data will be taken; age sex, stroke etiology, presence of stroke risk factors
      (as smoking history , hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus , history of hypertension, history of
      transient ischemic attacks, history of myocardial infarction or any cardiac problems). Stroke
      subtype will be classified according to the criteria of Trial of Org 10172 in acute Stroke
      Treatment (TOAST) classification. The clinical stroke syndrome will be determined by applying
      the criteria of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke project (OCSP). Stroke severity will be
      assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be measured
      at the time of admission. Brain imaging (either CT scan and /or MRI) will be performed after
      admission. Electrocardiography (ECG), Echocardiography (ECHO), Carotid and vertibrobasilar
      Duplex will be done for all patients. Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of complete
      blood picture (CBC), Random blood glucose levels, renal function tests (RFT), liver function
      tests (LFT), thyroid function tests (TFT), Lipid profile, Soluble CD40 Ligand and Neopetrin
      by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission.
