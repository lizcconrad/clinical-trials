  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 26 week, multiregional, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the
      long-term safety and tolerability of SEP-363856 for the treatment of subjects with
      schizophrenia who have completed the 4 week double-blind treatment phase of Study SEP361-201.

      No statistical hypothesis tests will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject must give written informed consent and privacy authorization prior to participation
        in the study and able to comply with the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.
        Separate consent will be obtained fro a caregiver or legal guardian if required by law.

          -  Subject has completed Study SEP361 201 through Week 4

          -  Subject has not taken any medication other than the study drug for the purpose of
             controlling schizophrenia symptoms during Study SEP361 201.

          -  Female subject must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 7 of Study SEP361
             201; females who are post-menopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea) and those who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy will
             be exempted from the pregnancy test. Female subject of reproductive potential agrees
             to remain abstinent or use highly effective and reliable contraception throughout the
             study and for at least 30 days after the last does of study drug has been taken. In
             the Investigator's judgment, the subject will adhere to this requirement.

          -  Male subjects with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to avoid
             fathering a child and use highly effective methods of birth control from screening
             until at least 30 days after the last study drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject answers &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;suicidal ideation&quot; Item 4 (active suicidal ideation with
             some intent to act, without specific plan) or Item 5 (active suicidal ideation with
             specific plan and intent) on the C-SSRS assessment at Visit 7 of Study SEP361 201.
             Subjects who answer &quot;yes&quot; to this question must be referred to the Investigator for
             follow up evaluation.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant abnormality including physical examination, vital
             signs, ECG, or laboratory test at Visit 7 of Study SEP361 201 that the investigator in
             consultation with the medical monitor considers to be inappropriate to allow
             participation in the study.

          -  Subject has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) or breath alcohol test at Visit 7 of
             Study SEP361 201.

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subject is at high risk of non-compliance in the Investigator's opinion.

          -  Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable in any other way to
