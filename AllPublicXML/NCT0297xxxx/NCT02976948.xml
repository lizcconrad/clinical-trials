      Main objective: To compare the efficacy of a new strategy of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
      versus a classical Sanger strategy, for the diagnosis of patients referred to the laboratory
      for suspected systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Compare after 6 months the impact of these strategies on the establishment of an
           effective treatment SAID following genetic result.

        -  Compare the distribution of different forms of SAID found with each genetic diagnostic
           strategies (NGS vs classic method).

    <textblock>
      Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID) include a broad spectrum of pathologies of innate
      immunity. In recent years, numerous publications have shown the involvement of new genes in
      these diseases, highlighting new pathophysiological pathways (inflammasome, NFkB: nuclear
      factor-kappa B, interferon) and new targeted therapies (biotherapy advantageously replacing
      non-specific anti-inflammatory drugs). Current laboratory diagnostic strategy is based on the
      Sanger method, the gold standard to date, allowing the sequential analysis of some genes
      (usually between 1 and 4). The nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of these
      diseases, the increasing number of genes involved and the low diagnostic yield obtained, make
      it essential to develop a new strategy, more efficient, so that the patient can benefit as
      soon as possible treatment suited to his pathology as soon as the gene involved is
      identified. The investigator had developed and validated in our genetic laboratories a new
      method based on the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). A panel of 32 known or candidate SAID
      genes, which can be simultaneously analyzed within a time compatible with the diagnosis. The
      investigator wishes to highlight the benefits of this new strategy.
