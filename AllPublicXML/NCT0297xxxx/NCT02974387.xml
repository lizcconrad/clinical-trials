      STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of (corneal Wound Healing
      and Intraocular Pressure) Fluorometholone and Loteprednol after photorefractive keratectomy
      (PRK) surgery.

      OVERALL STUDY DESIGN: Structure: Single-center, randomized, single blinded, contralateral
      (one eye receives FML, one eye Lotemax) Treatment Group: Patients will be randomized to the
      eye and will receive FML in one eye, Lotemax in contralateral eye Duration: 3 months
      Dosage/Dose Regimen: All patients will receive each one of the steroid agents 4 x a day for
      one month, 3 x a day for one month and 2 x a day for one month Study medication will be
      administered to the randomized eye through post op days according to mention protocol. Visit
      Schedule: baseline-screening, postop days 1, 7, 30 and then month 3th (through corneal
      re-epithelialization).
