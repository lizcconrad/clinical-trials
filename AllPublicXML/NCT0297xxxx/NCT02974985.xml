  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are tested in-vitro to measure their lifting capacity,
      viscosity, cohesivity, and rheologic properties, and their lifting capacity has been tested
      in animal models. To date, there are no studies that measure the lifting capacity of fillers
      in an in-vivo human model.

      The intention is to study the lifting capacity of fillers in a group of patients by comparing
      pre and post-procedure two and three-dimensional photographs using analytic software.
      Specifically, the PI is interested in determining the amount of tissue elevation created by
      injecting HAs Restylane-Lyft®, and Restylane-L® (Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, TX)
      to the midface and to the lower face, both in the anterior-posterior direction and in the
      vertical direction by using analytic software.

      The research group has identified a reliable and reproducible quantitative assessment of
      midfacial position called WIZDOM (Width of the InterZygomatic Distance Of the Midface) to
      quantitatively evaluate the midface. It can be used as an objective tool to assess midfacial
      rejuvenation, whether with fat, fillers, or midface or facelift surgery. The Distance from
      WIZDOM to inner canthus, the WIZDOM -IC measurement increases with aging as the face deflates
      and descends, and, in the practice, is also a means of assessing the midface in youth and in
      aging. The PI's findings have been published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. The practice
      will also attempt to utilize this metric as a measure of midface aesthetic lifting capacity.

      The practice will also employ 3 D photography and analytic software to determine degree of
      lift in mm in the y and z axis. (vertical and AP increase in dimension) pre and post-
      injection. (Vectra, Canfield, Fairfield, NJ)

      We will recruit patients from a population of subjects that generally would receive fillers
      to improve changes associated with facial volume loss and divide them in to two groups based
      on chronologic age.

      All fillers will be injected in locations where the FDA has approved it for on-label
      indications (the cheek, subcutaneously and supraperiosteally, the dermis and subdermis for
      the correction of wrinkles and folds such as the nasolabial fold) and placed as usual and
      customary using techniques as practiced by the authors and as are accepted widely.

      Additional steps prior to injection for this study are temporary sterile magic marker
      markings markers on the face and detailed photography, both 2D and 3D, that will be taken
      before, during, and after injection, and the segmentation of injections such that the midface
      will be injected prior to and separately from the lower face.

      Three dimensional data will be analyzed using Vectra analytic software, and 2-D photographs
      will be analyzed by measuring improvements in WIZDOM (width of the interzygomatic distance of
      the midface) and its distance to the inner canthus.
