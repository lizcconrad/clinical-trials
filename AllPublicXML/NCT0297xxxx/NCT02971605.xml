  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will assess whether ingestion of a classic hallucinogen (psilocybin)
      leads to changes in emotion processing and neural circuitry that may predict repeated
      self-administration of this drug and underlie an atypical mechanism of abuse liability, which
      may vitally contribute to the understanding of the potential for abuse and the underlying
      mechanisms supporting abuse of classic hallucinogens.

             laboratory tests

          -  Agree to consume approximately the same amount of caffeine-containing beverage (e.g.,
             coffee, tea) that he/she consumes on a usual morning, before arriving at the research
             unit on the morning of the drug session day. If the participant does not routinely
             consume caffeinated beverages, he/she must agree not to do so on the session day.

          -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and

             nonprescription medication, nutritional supplement, or herbal supplement except when
             approved by the study investigators. Exceptions will be evaluated by the study
             investigators and will include acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,

             psilocybin sessions will not be conducted until at least 5 half-lives of the agent
             have elapsed after the last dose.

          -  More than 20% outside the upper or lower range of ideal body weight according to
             Metropolitan Life height and weight table
