    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that most perinatal women at risk for postpartum depression do
      not engage in mental health services, even when referred by home visiting (HV) programs,
      primary care physicians, obstetricians, or gynecologists. Thus, interventions that can be
      delivered via alternative settings—e.g., HV programs—are essential to prevent the onset of
      major depression and worsening of depressive symptoms among perinatal women. This Patient
      Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded project aims to evaluate whether the
      Mothers and Babies (MB) group intervention, when led by paraprofessional home visitors, is
      more efficacious than usual care (i.e., home visiting without the MB enhancement). It will
      also examine if MB, when led by paraprofessional home visitors, is not inferior to MB
      delivered by mental health professionals. The results of this study will inform
      decision-making by HV programs regarding provision of MB to perinatal women at risk for
      developing major depression.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1 is to conduct a superiority trial that compares the efficacy of MB delivered by
      paraprofessional home visitors versus usual care (i.e., home visiting without MB) on
      patient-reported outcomes, including depressive symptoms, quality of life, parenting
      practices, engagement in pleasant activities, and relationship with one's partner.

      Aim #2 is to conduct a non-inferiority trial that compares the effectiveness of MB delivered
      by (a) mental health clinicians versus (b) paraprofessional home visitors.

      Aim #3 is to evaluate whether effectiveness of the two versions of MB (clinician led vs.
      paraprofessional home visitor led) varies according to patient characteristics (e.g., race,
      ethnicity, first-time mother, and/or geographic type of home visiting (HV) program (i.e.,
      urban vs. rural).

      Aim #4 is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of MB delivered by paraprofessional
      home visitors and mental health clinicians.

      Postpartum depression is a serious mental health disorder that poses significant health and
      mental health risks for mothers and their infants. Research suggests that prevalence rates of
      postpartum depression are higher among low-income women than among middle-or high-income
      women. There is also consistent evidence that low-income women are less likely to receive
      mental health services in the perinatal (i.e., pregnancy until child's first birthday) period
      than their more affluent counterparts due to a variety of factors including stigma related to
      mental health service use and lack of access to community-based mental health providers.
      Postpartum depression is a particularly serious problem for low-income women, as it has the
      potential to create two generations of suffering, for both mother and child. It is estimated
      that over 10% of low-income infants have a mother who has major depression and more than 50%
      have a mother with some depressive symptoms. Postpartum depression has negative consequences
      for maternal parenting practices. Compared with women not suffering from postpartum
      depression, depressed women tend to be less positive, less spontaneous, and less responsive
      with their infants. Postpartum depression has been linked to developmental delays among
      infants of depressed mothers, including social interaction difficulties, attachment
      insecurity, and cognitive impairments.

      Home visiting (HV) programs that provide services to perinatal women are one of the largest
      avenues through which perinatal women come to the attention of service providers, making HV a
      unique and viable setting for delivering mental health services. Although professional HV
      models exist (e.g., Nurse-Family Partnership), most HV programs in the United States use
      paraprofessionals. Previously, study investigators have established the efficacy of a
      group-based intervention —the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course—in preventing the onset of
      postpartum depression and reducing depressive symptoms when led by mental health
      professionals. However, to date there are no interventions led by non-health or non-mental
      health professionals that have demonstrated efficacy in preventing the onset and worsening of
      postpartum depression among low-income women. This project attempts to fill this notable gap.

      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial in which HV clients receive either
      a) MB delivered by mental health professionals, b) MB delivered by paraprofessional home
      visitors, or c) usual home visiting services. This study design will allow the investigators
      to conduct a superiority trial that compares the efficacy of MB delivered by paraprofessional
      home visitors versus usual care. A superiority trial will allow the investigators to generate
      efficacy data on MB delivered by paraprofessional home visitors. The study design will also
      allow the investigators to conduct a non-inferiority trial that compares the effectiveness of
      MB delivered by mental health professionals versus paraprofessional home visitors. Should the
      investigators find that paraprofessional home visitors are not inferior to mental health
      professionals in delivering the intervention, HV programs throughout the United States will
      be able to implement the MB Course with paraprofessional home visitors—an approach that is
      considerably more efficient and cost-effective than employing mental health professionals.

      This study was born out of community stakeholders' need and desire for a low-cost
      intervention that could prevent the onset and worsening of depression among low-income women
      enrolled in HV programs. Maternal depression is an enormous challenge facing HV programs.
      However, there is consistent evidence that low-income women exhibiting depressive
      symptoms—including women enrolled in HV programs—do not access mental health treatment in the
      community. Lack of available mental health professionals, stigma in seeking mental health
      services, and logistical challenges (e.g., childcare, transportation) are a few of the
      barriers faced by perinatal women seeking mental health services. For those clients who do
      access services, most perinatal women are likely to receive pharmacological treatments,
      despite the fact that the vast majority of perinatal women prefer non-pharmacologic
      interventions.

      HV programs are ideal settings for delivering mental health care to perinatal women because
      their mission is not stigmatizing and HV programs tend to be trusted entities in the
      communities they serve. However, there is not yet an evidence-based intervention that can be
      delivered by paraprofessionals (such as home visitors), thereby limiting HV programs'
      capacity to meet the needs of their clients needing mental health services.

    <description>The investigators anticipate a clinically meaningfully difference to be on the order of five points (as this is the difference in score on each severity level of depression) (Trivedi et al., 2004). For our non-inferiority analyses comparing MB led by home visitors vs. MB led by mental health clinicians, we will have &gt;85% power to detect a difference difference in mean QIDS-16 scores of two points between the two arms.</description>

    <measure>The change in the Behavioral Activation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 and 24-week postpartum follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Activation will be measured using the Behavioral Activation Depression Scale (BADS). The BADS assesses behaviors hypothesized to underlie depression and specifically targeted for change by behavioral activation strategies. It examines changes in the following areas: activation, avoidance/ rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. The BADS consists of 25 items, each rated on a seven point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). The BADS has demonstrated strong internal consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity (Kanter et al, 2007; Kanter et al., 2009).</description>

    <measure>The change in the Pleasant Activities Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 and 24-week postpartum follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Pleasant Activities will be measured using a checklist adapted from the Pleasant Events Schedule (PES; MacPhillamy &amp; Lewinsohn, 1982). The original PES is a behavioral self-report measure on which respondents rate 320 pleasant events with respect to how frequently they occurred over the past month [&quot;has not happened&quot; (0) to &quot;happened often&quot; (3)] and how pleasant they were [&quot;not pleasant&quot; (0) to &quot;very pleasant&quot; (3)]. The measure was found to have strong psychometric properties, including concurrent and predictive validity (MacPhillamy &amp; Lewinsohn, 1982). In this study, we will use a brief (~25 item) form of this checklist that includes pleasant events relevant for low-income pregnant women.</description>

    <measure>The change in the Negative Mood Regulation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 and 24-week postpartum follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Mood regulation will be measured using the Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMRS) (Catanzaro &amp; Means, 1990). For each question, respondents use a 5-point scale to indicate what they believe they can do when they are disappointed or experiencing a negative mood.</description>

    <description>Social support will be measured using the 19-item Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) (Sherbourne &amp; Stewart, 1991). This brief self-administered survey includes an overall functional social support index, as well as four functional support subscales: affectionate, emotional/informational, tangible, and positive social interaction.</description>

    <description>The Mothers and Babies group intervention is comprised of 6, two hour sessions. It is divided into three overall sections, one on each of the following Cognitive Behavioral Theory components; Pleasant Activities, Thoughts, and Contact with Others. In each of these sections, participants are first taught to understand how the component influences her mood. This teaching of the relationships between CBT components and mood is referred to as psychoeducation. In addition to psychoeducation, participants also receive concrete skills in each of the three sections (pleasant activities, thoughts, contact with others). These skills are intended to provide participants with a &quot;toolkit&quot; of approaches they can use to improve their mood.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will enroll only pregnant women in this study, given that the
             Mothers and Babies Course is delivered prenatally as a postpartum depression
             prevention intervention. The investigators will offer participation to prenatal home
             visiting clients, ages 16 and older, knowing the client base for home visiting
             programs includes pregnant teens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with high-risk medical and pregnancy conditions will be excluded since this may
             preclude women from regularly attending intervention sessions. The investigators will
             not exclude women based on race/ethnicity or based on demographic characteristics
             other than the ability to speak English or Spanish.
