  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proportion of the elderly population has increased rapidly worldwide. Frailty is a common
      geriatric syndrome. Comprehensive dietary management strategy may have beneficial effects on
      frailty prevention and reversal. We compared the effects between micronutrients and/or
      protein supplement, and balanced diet on frailty status in elderly individuals who were at
      either pre-frail or frail stage. A total of 37 subjects completed a 3-month paralleled,
      single-blind, randomized control trial on (1) multiple nutrients supplementations, (2)
      multiple nutrients plus isolated soy protein supplementation, and (3) individualized
      nutrition education with designed dishware for balanced diet as well as food supplementations
      (mixed nuts and milk powder). Intervention effects on dietary intakes, biomarkers, frailty
      score and geriatric depression score (GDS) were assessed. The nutrition education
      intervention with designed dishware and milk powder/nuts supplement significantly increased
      the intake of vegetables, dairy, and nuts, along with increased concentration of urinary urea
      nitrogen of the pre-frail/frail elders. It yielded a significant reduction in frailty score
      (p&lt;0.05) and a borderline decrease (p=0.063) in GDS-SF. Our study indicated that the dietary
      approach with easy-to-comprehend dishware and food supplements to optimize the distribution
      of multiple dietary components showed its potential to improve not only frail status but also
      psychological condition in elderly.

    <description>Usual dietary intake was assessed by inquiring about most frequently consumed breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items and the corresponding amounts by licensed dietitians with the assistance of food models and measuring dishware. Dietary intake data were transformed into nutrient data, using a computerized worksheet based on Nutrition and Health Survey Food and Nutrient Database.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed frailty score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to month 1 and to month 3</time_frame>
    <description>All participants were evaluated for frailty, based on the modified Fried criteria. Five frail phenotypes were assigned: (1) unintentional weight loss, (2) self-reported exhaustion, (3) weak grip strength, (4) slow gait speed, and (5) low level of physical activity. For estimating frailty score, participants scored one point from each phenotype if any of which was satisfied with a maximal score of 5 in total. Participants were classified as pre-frail by one point, and as frail by 3 or more points, otherwise as robust.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to month 1 and to month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Geriatric depression scale-short form (GDS-SF) Chinese version is a 15-item assessment used to identify depression in the elderly. Participants with 5-9 points were at risk of depression, and ≥10 points were depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed urinary urea nitrogen levels</measure>

    <description>The first morning urine sample was collected by subjects and brought into the hospital for analyzing urinary urea nitrogen.</description>

    <description>Nutritional status was assessed by mini nutritional assessment-short form (MNA-SF). MNA-SF point ≥12 was of normal nutritional status; between 8 and 11 was at risk for malnutrition; ≤7 was at malnutrition status.</description>
