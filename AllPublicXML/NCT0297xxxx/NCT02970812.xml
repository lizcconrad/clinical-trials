      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, controlled study was designed to
      investigate the efficacy of electrical muscle simulation (EMS) for treatment of waist
      circumference (WC) reduction in abdominal obese adults.

      60 patients with abdominal obese, man with WC &gt; 90 cm and woman with WC &gt; 80 cm, received EMS
      as experimental group (EG) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as control
      group (CG) 5 times a week for 12 weeks.

      circumference (WC) reduction in abdominal obese adults.

      Methods: 60 patients with abdominal obese, man with WC &gt; 90 cm and woman with WC &gt; 80 cm,
      received EMS as experimental group (EG) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
      as control group (CG) 5 times a week for 12 weeks.

    <description>EMS program was consisted of warm-up, warm-down, contraction and relaxation. It was programed to be resemble to actual muscle action of voluntary exercise. To increase energy consumption as high intensity exercise, tripled the contraction duration. EMS group used Program 3 and regulated intensity though channel from 1 to 4.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous group used Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) which is the use of electric current produced to stimulate the sensory nerves to block pain signal. It is programed to applied currents regularly, once a second with a frequency of 1 Hz.</description>
