      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of acupuncture with usual care on treating
      chronic pain. This study has three groups. Two groups will received acupuncture. One group
      will receive usual standard of care for 12 weeks and then will receive acupuncture.
      Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese technique of using very thin needles inserted in the skin
      to treat different symptoms and illness, and to promote healing. Each group will undergo a
      different method of needle administration.
