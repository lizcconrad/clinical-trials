      Background: High fructose intake increases blood lactate, triglyceride and uric acid
      concentrations. Uric acid may contribute to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in the
      general population. In patients with hereditary fructose intolerance fructose consumption is
      associated with acute hypoglycemia, renal tubular acidosis, and hyperuricemia.

      Objective: We investigated whether asymptomatic carriers for hereditary fructose intolerance
      (HFI) would have a higher sensitivity to adverse effects of fructose than the general
      population.

      Design: Eight subjects heterozygous for HFI (hHFI; 4 males, 4 females) and eight controls
      received for 7 days a low fructose diet and on the eighth day ingested a test meal calculated
      to provide 25% of basal energy requirement containing labeled fructose (13C fructose 0.35
      g/kg), protein (0.21 g/kg) and lipid (0.22 g/kg). Total fructose oxidation, total endogenous
      glucose production (by 6,6-2H2-glucose dilution), carbohydrate and lipid oxidation, lipids,
      uric acid, lactate, creatinine, urea and amino acids were monitored for 6 hours.
