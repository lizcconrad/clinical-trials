  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators perform a prospective, randomized, clinical study involving students in
      education with mood disorders and randomized to an intensive exercise program or a control
      relaxation activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to document the benefit of an intensive exercise program in youth with
      the aim to identify the most effective programs that can improve psychological well-being,
      especially reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and improving self-esteem. This study
      targets participants aged 9 to 30 years and included in an education program (from 4th Grade
      to undergraduate university or college). The investigators propose to perform a prospective,
      randomized, clinical study involving participants with mood disorders (International
      Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for medical
      coding: ICD-10-CM F32.9), anxiety (ICD-10-CM F41.9), specific learning disabilities (ADHD
      hyperactivity (ICD-10-CM F90.2), dyslexia-dyscalculia-dyspraxia (ICD-10-CM F81.0, F81.2,
      F81.81)) and healthy subjects equally distributed for confounding variables (age, gender,
      subclinical depressive symptoms). The participants will be enrolled either in an
      experimental, intensive aerobic exercise regime or in a active control activity of stretching
      and relaxation conducted in parallel. The effects of this program will be assessed for i)
      psychological symptoms, using questionnaires, ii) cognitive function, particularly attention
      skills and executive functions, in neuropsychological tasks, and iii) physical abilities
      (through physical testing). To investigate the therapeutic value of exercise in the
      prevention of depressive and anxiety symptoms and in the treatment of mood disorders in the
      young student is a necessity imposed by the current outbreak of depression among adolescents
      and young people at school. To promote the exercise medicine based on the level of evidence
      in this specific domain, rigorous experimental studies must be performed. Depending on the
      results, a medical imaging will be proposed to participants at the end of the behavioral
      study. This will be a functional magnetic resonance imaging in physiological activation
      condition (performing a behavioral task such as a Stroop task suited to the subject's age),
      performed before and after intensive physical training.
