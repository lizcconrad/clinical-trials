    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer, comprised of 30% of overall colorectal cancer cohort, is one of the leading
      cancers of Taiwan. In patients with advanced disease, the standard of care is concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) before surgery. After CCRT, the abscopal effect, a phenomenon that
      localized radiation not only destroys local tumor but also inhibits the growth of tumor at
      the remote site, has been observed. This effect is believed to be associated with tumor
      immune response. In addition, other immune checkpoint molecules, such as Programmed cell
      death-1(PD-1), Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated
      Protein 4 (CTLA-4), have been reported associated with therapeutic outcome. However, after
      CCRT, more than 50% of patients were still either having persistent disease or developed
      distant metastasis. To improve therapeutic outcome of patients with rectal cancer, this
      project, thus, aims at exploring the evolution of factors that may affect the abscopal effect
      and immune checkpoint functions in tissues and in blood before and after CCRT.

      For most patients, preoperative chemoradiotherapy results in clinically tumor regression, but
      the degree of response varies among patients. There are approximately 40-60% of LARC patients
      treated with CCRT achieve some degree of pathologic response. However, there is yet an
      effective method before the commencement of CCRT that can predict how patients will respond
      to CCRT and can subsequently render better survival. Identify patents who will benefit most
      from CCRT is crucial not only in lowering treatment-related morbidity and sustaining local
      control but also to improve survival rate in LARC.
