      To assess cognitive performance by means of the game of Solitaire. In this study, the
      investigators want to define relevant game metrics, when playing Solitaire, that may be
      indicative of cognitive performance.

      12-15 healthy older persons will be observed, as well as 12-15 persons with cognitive
      impairment, while playing Solitaire. This will take the shape of contextual inquiries, i.e.
      the researcher visits the older person in his/her natural context and ask his/her to play
      Solitaire. Older persons will be observed playing 8-10 rounds of playing Solitaire, both with
      a physical deck of card and on a tablet. Gameplay actions and player behaviors will be
      observed and recorded for later analysis, via screen capturing software installed on the
      tablet, including the recordings of facial expressions and verbal utterances via the
      integrated touchpad camera and microphone. According to the contextual inquiry method, which
      is a 'light' form of participant observation, the researcher will take the role of an
      'apprentice'; he/she will observe and may ask questions for a better understanding of the
      player actions. At the end of the visit, following cognitive domains will be measured through
      pen-and-paper testing: visual scanning and psychomotor speed (Digit symbol substitution
      test), attention and executive function (Trail making test, digit span, verbal fluency, maze
      test), Camden topographical memory,... The duration of such a visit will last approximately
      120 minutes.

      These observations of game play actions and behaviors and the results that participants
      obtained on the cognitive test battery will be analyzed with experts in light of cognitive
      performance. More particular, the investigator will look for the measurable aspects of
      cognitive performance in the game, guided by earlier measures put forward by Jimison et al
      and Kaye et al. While they still list generic measures (e.g. 'target detection' or 'correctly
      retrieving item from previous knowledge'), this study will now operationalize these
      specifically for the game of Solitaire and for the target group (e.g. 'detection of card to
      move onto the build stack' or 'retrieving the card as available from the pile'). Hence,
      possible game metrics will be discussed and defined.

    <description>From this study, metrics will be defined which can measure cognitive performance in cardgames like Solitaire. Possible candidates are, but are not limited to: situational awareness to measure visual perception and performance on dual tasks to measure divided attention. A more detailed table of possible game metrics of cognitive performance can be found in H. B. Jimison, M. Pavel, P. Bissell, and J. McKanna, &quot;A Framework for Cognitive Monitoring Using Computer Game Interactions,&quot; Medinfo 2007 Proc. 12th World Congr. Health Med. Inform. Build. Sustain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the HEALTHY participants

          1. The participant has a minimum age of 65 years.

          2. The participant is living independently or semi-independently at home, service flat or
             care home.

          3. The participant has no subjective memory concern as reported by the participant,
             informant, or clinician.

          4. The participant has a normal brain function documented by scoring above 27 on the
             MMSE, above 26 on the MOCA and has a score of 0 for the CDR.

          5. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is in stable medical condition and
             willing and able to perform study procedures in the opinion of the investigator.
