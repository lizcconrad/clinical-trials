  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety and effect of intralymphatic allergen specific immunotherapy
      in increasing doses. Patients with allergy to grass or birch will be treated with three
      intralymphatic injections in an up-dosing protocol; 1000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U and 10 000 SQ-U, or
      placebo.

      ***IMPORTANT INFORMATION!*** The up-dosing protocol is changed due to adverse events at 5000
      SQ-U. One patient had general utricaria 15 minutes after injection (moderate reaction). One
      patient had a serious adverse event with anaphylactic reaction 6 minutes after intralymphatic
      injection. (1000 SQ-U and 3000 SQ-U have been given with no serious adverse events.) New
      regimen: 1000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U.

      40 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis will be recruited. Study subjects are randomized
      to intralymphatic injections with placebo or ALK Alutard 5-grasses or birch. Injections are
      given with 4-5 (-7) weeks interval.
