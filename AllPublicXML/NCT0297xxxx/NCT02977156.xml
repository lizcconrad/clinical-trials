  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of anti-CTLA4 therapy has inaugurated a paradigm shift in oncology where drugs
      target the immune system rather than cancer cells in order to stimulate the anti-tumor immune
      response. In situ immunization is a strategy where immunomodulatory products such as
      pathogens are injected into one tumor site in order to trigger a systemic anti-tumor immune
      response. Of importance, pre-clinical rationale has demonstrated that combination of
      anti-CTLA4 therapy together with intra-tumoral (IT) oncolytic virus can overcome primary
      resistance to systemic anti-CTLA4 therapy. Pexastimogene Devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) is one of
      the new vaccinia oncolytic viruses genetically modified to express GM-CSF. This new and
      innovative oncolytic virotherapy should therefore synergize with anti-CTLA4 therapy via
      virus-induced tumor cell death &amp; tumor-antigen release, GM-CSF-induced
      recruitment/maturation/activation of antigen presenting cells, and anti-CTLA4-induced Treg
      blockade/depletion. Intra-tumoral delivery of immunostimulating agents should, therefore,
      provide lower toxicity of mAb targeting immune checkpoints. Of note, IT injections of
      GM-CSF-encoding oncolytic viruses have already been shown to induce immune-mediated tumor
      responses on local (injected) and distant (not injected) tumor sites. In solid injectable
      refractory/relapsing metastatic tumors, we make the hypothesis that the addition of Pexa-Vec
      to IT ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 Ab) will overcome primary/secondary resistance to standard
      therapy and/or immunotherapy with a better in situ tumor antigen specific T-cell priming. Our
      proposal is to conduct a 2-part Phase I clinical trial in order to define the feasibility,
      the safety and the anti-tumor effects of intra-tumoral injections of ipilimumab in
      combination with the oncolytic virus Pexa-Vec. Dose escalation step will define the MTD and
      RP2D of that in situ immunization strategy. Expansion part will assess the anti-tumor effect
      of the combination.

      The study is a proof of concept, open label, multicentric, 2-parts, Phase I dose escalation
      trial. In dose selection part (any histological types except HCC), patients will be treated
      with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection ) alone at Week
      1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab (up to 4 dose levels) at Weeks 3, 5 and
      9. The dose escalation part will follow a classical 3+3 design. 3 to 6 patients will be
      enrolled at each DL (Dose Level) depending of the number of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
      observed. At the end of each DL cohort, a teleconference (Dose escalation meeting) will be
      organized with the sponsor, in order to select the dose for the next cohort. In Expansion
      cohorts ( up to 3 cohorts) patients will be treated with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec
      alone (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection) at Week 1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec +
      ipilimumab (RP2D) at Weeks 3, 5 and 9. In both parts, the treatment with both IMPs should be
      continued as per protocol until Withdrawal of consent, Disease progression as per irRC
      (immune related response criteria), General or specific changes in the patient's condition
      that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the
      investigator, Pregnancy or Unacceptable adverse events(s) including DLTs.

    <description>DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following events evaluated as related to study drugs and occurring during the first 5 weeks (Part A) of investigative treatment(s): any Grade ≥ 4 treatment related toxicity, any Grade≥ 3 treatment related toxicity lasting more than 7 days (except for flu-like symptoms that respond to standard therapies.), any Grade ≥ 3 treatment related acute immune related AE involving major end organs, Grade ≥ 3 injection site reaction, Any other study drug related toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opinion of the investigators after discussion with the sponsor. Indeed, as a principle in this Phase I study, any toxicity that the investigator or the sponsor determines to be dose-limiting, regardless of the grade, may be considered as a DLT.</description>
