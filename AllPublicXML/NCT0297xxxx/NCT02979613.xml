    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of switching to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versus continuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) in virologically suppressed adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
