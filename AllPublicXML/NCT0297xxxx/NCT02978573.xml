      Evaluate and confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Cartiva SCI implant
      established by the pivotal trial.

    <textblock>
      As part of the Conditions of Approval of Cartiva SCI for the treatment of first MTP
      osteoarthritis, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires additional long term data to
      evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of Cartiva including the durability and
      survivorship of the implant. This Post-Approval Study (PAS) addendum is intended to
      supplement the initial 24 months follow up period and provide additional long term safety and
      effectiveness data on Cartiva

    <measure>Long Term Safety of the Cartiva Implant by demonstrating durability over the long term and no unanticipated safety concerns that arise</measure>
    <time_frame>5 year</time_frame>
    <description>Durability of the implant over the longer term. This will be addressed using survival analysis starting at Month 24 to determine the rate of implant removals among devices that survived to Month 24. A complementary survival analysis starting at index surgery to end of study will also be performed.
There are no unanticipated safety concerns that arise after Month 24 up to 5 years. This will be addressed by a) determining the incidence of serious device-related adverse events per year and overall from Month 24 to Year 5; and b) summarizing device-related radiographic complications1 over time from Month 24 to Year 5. Note that this analysis will address both device and procedure related complications and serious device-related adverse events whether observed previously in the 24 month follow up portion of the study or encountered for this first time during the extended follow-up period.</description>
