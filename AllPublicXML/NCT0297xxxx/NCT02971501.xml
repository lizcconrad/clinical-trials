  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well osimertinib with or without bevacizumab works
      in treating patients with EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the
      brain. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving osimertinib with or without bevacizumab may work
      better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival with AZD9291 (osimertinib) plus bevacizumab
      compared to AZD9291 (osimertinib) alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of AZD9291 (osimertinib) and
      bevacizumab.

      II. To evaluate the time to progression in the central nervous system (CNS) with AZD9291
      (osimertinib) plus bevacizumab versus single-agent osimertinib.

      III. To determine the overall response rate and the intracranial response rate to the
      combination versus single agent.

      IV. To assess the overall survival in patients receiving AZD9291 (osimertinib) plus
      bevacizumab compared to AZD9291 (osimertinib) alone.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to combination AZD9291
      (osimertinib) plus bevacizumab versus AZD9291 (osimertinib) by molecularly characterizing
      tumor samples including T790M status.

      II. To assess whether circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in plasma can be used as
      an indicator of sensitivity and resistance to treatment.

      III. To determine whether an angiogenic signature using a multiplex panel array is associated
      with benefit from the combination of AZD9291 (osimertinib) plus bevacizumab.

      IV. To investigate angiogenesis, immune and signaling pathway markers in tumor samples to
      determine biomarkers predictive of benefit from combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and bevacizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 4 weeks.

             L858R point mutation, or any other mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI
             sensitivity); presence of an activating EGFR mutation may be documented in tumor

             second-generation EGFR TKI; presence of an EGFR T790M mutation may be documented from
             biopsy material from any site of disease (intra- or extra-cranial) or from plasma
             testing if performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory; for patients who have disease
             progression in the CNS only (with otherwise stable disease systemically), T790M
             positivity is not required

          -  Disease progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI (i.e. erlotinib,
             gefitinib, or afatinib); patient may have also received prior chemotherapy or

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable CNS lesion that is asymptomatic, untreated,
             and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment; measurable CNS disease

             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 5 mm (&gt;= 0.5 cm) with brain magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI); if the lesion is 5-10 mm in size and is the only measurable
             disease, MRI imaging must be performed with 1.5 mm slice thickness or less; a history
             of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, however any lesion present at the
             time of whole brain radiotherapy or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field
             (or within 2 mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered &quot;untreated&quot; unless it is
             new or documented to have progressed unequivocally since treatment

          -  Patients are not required to have measurable systemic (i.e. non-CNS) disease; if
             present, measurable systemic disease must be able to be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short
             axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT
                  interval

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (including clinically significant
             hemoptysis)

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption of AZD9291 (osimertinib)

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other
             recombinant human antibodies

          -  Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose
             of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inducers of
             CYP3A4 (at least 3 week prior); all patients must try to avoid concomitant use of any
             medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known inducer effects
             on CYP3A4

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including, but not limited
             to, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations which in the
             investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol, or active infection
             including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); screening
             for chronic conditions is not required

          -  History of hypersensitivity active or inactive excipients of AZD9291 (osimertinib) or
             drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD9291 (osimertinib)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L

          -  Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable
             liver metastases or &gt; 5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases; aspartate
             aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 times ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or &gt; 5 times ULN
             in the presence of liver metastases

          -  Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times ULN if no liver metastases or &gt; 3 times ULN in the
             presence of documented Gilbert's syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) or liver
             metastases

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min
             (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation)—confirmation of creatinine
             clearance is only required when creatinine is &gt; 1.5 times ULN

          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements
