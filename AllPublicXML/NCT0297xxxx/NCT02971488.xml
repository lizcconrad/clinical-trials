  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening, diagnosis and treatment of HCV in PWID, should be part of a harm reduction
      strategy. Treatment of HCV infected PWID should be delivered in a multidisciplinary care
      setting with services to reduce the risk of reinfection and for management of the common
      social and psychiatric comorbidities in this population. More frequent diagnosis, new methods
      that prevent loss of tracking, and access to antiviral treatment are all strategies that must
      be implemented jointly if the prevalence of HCV infection in our setting is to be reduced.

    <measure>Implementation of an alternative screening program for active HCV infection in PWID</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>First we will develop and validate an alternative method of screening for active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on collection of capillary blood via finger pricking and WhatmanTM cards. Secondly we will implement this alternative way of screening for HCV in the Cañada Real in Madrid. Screening will be carried out by a harm reduction unit. And the population screened will be persons who inject drugs (PWID).</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention. Subjects who had a positive result in the screening performed in Cañada Real Galiana will be contacted and offered the possibility of referral to HUIL, where they will have access to standard confirmation tests. Here, test accuracy will be evaluated at population level. Patients will have access to HCV treatment and will be followed for assessment of the impact of the program on patients' health (referrals to health centers, percentage of treated patients, and the percentage of virological response). The percentage will be calculated as follows: number of active HCV infections/ number of active drug users screened for HCV.</description>

        The study population comprises persons who visit the Cañada Real Galiana shantytown on the
        outskirts of Madrid, where 90% of illegal drugs in the region are sold and consumed. It is
        estimated that between 4000 and 6000 people per day visit the shantytown for their dose.
        The regional government's Anti-Drug Agency has a mobile HRU operating daily in the area.
        The unit provides screening tests to anyone who is willing to take them, regardless of
        whether they are already aware of their serological status or not. Screening includes
        education on prevention of HCV infection and other transmissible diseases.
