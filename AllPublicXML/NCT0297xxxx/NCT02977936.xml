    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate at 3 months the effect of a supplementation with extracts
      of Curcuma longa, Boswellia serrata and Porphyra umbilicalis on the acceptability of pain for
      patients suffering from gonarthritic pain.

      For this study, 126 patients are going to be included. They will have a supplementation of
      Phytostandard® rhodiola / saffron, from 4 capsules per day during 90 days.

      on the one hand, during the two visits (inclusion and follow-up), the investigator completes
      the questionnaire about neuropathic pain (DN4).

      on the other hand, patients complete the Osteoarthritis Symptom Inventory Scale (OASIS) 4
      times : just after the inclusion visit, at day 30, at day 60 and just before the follow-up
      visit (day 90). He completes the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII), the Minimal
      Clinically Important Improvement (MCII) and the Acceptable Symptomatic Statement (PASS) 6
      times : just after the inclusion visit, at day 10, at day 20, at day 30, at day 60 and just
      before the follow-up visit (day 90).
