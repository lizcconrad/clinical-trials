  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of CYD dengue vaccine
      and Cervarix when administered concomitantly or sequentially in healthy female subjects aged
      9-14 years of age.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of geometric mean titers
           [GMTs]) to Cervarix after concomitant administration with the CYD dengue vaccine is
           non-inferior to the humoral immune response (in terms of GMTs) after sequential
           administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of
           Cervarix

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of GMTs) to the CYD dengue
           vaccine after concomitant administration with Cervarix is non-inferior to the humoral
           immune response (in terms of GMTs) to the CYD dengue vaccine after sequential
           administration with Cervarix measured 28 days after the last dose of the CYD dengue
           vaccine

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to Cervarix
           after concomitant administration with the CYD dengue vaccine is non-inferior to the
           humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to Cervarix sequential
           administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of
           Cervarix

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to Cervarix at baseline and after each dose of
           Cervarix in each and any group

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine at baseline and after
           each dose of the CYD dengue vaccine, in each and any group

        -  To describe the safety of Cervarix and CYD dengue vaccine after each and any dose in
           each group

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were to receive 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of Cervarix
      administered either concomitantly or sequentially. Due to a protocol amendment, only
      previously dengue exposed participants (seropositive for dengue before vaccination) will be
      eligible to complete the vaccination schedule and be assessed for CYD immunogenicity and
      human papilloma virus (HPV) immunogenicity. Dengue unexposed participants (seronegative for
      dengue before vaccination) will not receive the third CYD dengue vaccine injection, but will
      be followed for safety up to 6 months after the last injection.

      Safety assessments include solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection,
      unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events
      during the study period. All participants will be included in the assessment of safety up to
      6 months after the last injection.
