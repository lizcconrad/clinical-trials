      Take a Break (TAB) is a randomized trial designed to evaluate NRT-sampling and a mHealth
      suite of apps. TAB is a time-limited self-efficacy and skills building experience for
      Motivation Phase smokers. TAB is designed to create a timeline within which motivation
      smokers will be encouraged to try a brief period of abstinence. Smokers in this Motivation
      Phase are relatively untapped in research available information. This project offers these
      smokers point-of-need technology support in the many components of the intervention.

      The Take a Break intervention is designed to increase self-efficacy and support new skills
      for Motivation Phase smokers. The investigators hypothesize that, compared with the NRT-only
      group, the Take a Break group will have a greater number of days abstinent during the 'break'
      period, a greater increase in self-efficacy at the end of the 'break' period, a lower time to
      first quit attempt, and a higher rate of quit at 6 months. This research study will also
      provide valuable insight into this population of smokers and increase our understanding of
      which tools may be effective in helping them quit smoking.

      Our Specific Aims are

        -  AIM 1: Refine the Take a Break mHealth tool and implementation program.

        -  AIM 2: Conduct a randomized trial of the effectiveness of Take a Break.

        -  AIM 3: Follow participants in the AIM 2 randomized clinical trial for 6 months to
           evaluate time to quit attempts, number of quit attempts, and 6-month biochemically
           verified point prevalent cessation

    <description>Smoking cessation trialists have recommended assessment of smoking cessation in randomized trials of motivational interventions of point prevalence cessation. The Take a Break trial is defined as a test of treatment to motivation cessation (also termed cessation induction). As Hughes and colleagues for the Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco Workgroup on Measurement note, point prevalence cessation is often the best measure for motivation phase trials.</description>

    <description>For the comparison group, implementation will be balanced in all variables except the Take a Break Intervention. The investigators will balance the two groups further by having the comparison (NRT-Sampling group) complete mHealth assessments (without feedback or goal-setting) as an attention control.
Participants randomized to the comparison group will only have access to a mHealth assessment tool similar to the &quot;Challenge Quizzes&quot; but without feedback.</description>

    <description>The Intervention: Take a Break as an augmentation to NRT-sampling in Motivation Phase. Take a Break is an intervention in which smokers are encouraged to engage in smoking abstinence. The main element, the &quot;Break,&quot; is a two-week challenge where smokers report days they are smoke-free. The Break is preceded by a 1-week training challenge where Challenge Quizzes (ecological momentary assessments) collect information to guide the smokers during the Break. At baseline, all smokers will be provided NRT lozenges for sampling. At weeks 1 and 3 of the &quot;Marathon&quot;, our Tobacco Treatment Specialist will call all smokers, assess their experiences and collect data.Participants in the intervention will receive the full tool suite.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For all Aims, investigators will include individuals 18 years and older who are
             identified as current smokers who are not preparing to quit, and are active in care
             within the UMMHC system or at the Boston VAMC. Active in care is defined as having at
             least two clinical visits in the past year. If an eligible participant does not
             already have a smart phone, one will be provided to them, free of charge, for the
             duration of their participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion Criteria: Those unwilling to sample nicotine lozenges or participate in the
             game will be excluded. All patients already on NRT will be excluded. All participants
             who have a FDA contraindication or cautions for nicotine lozenge use (pregnancy,
             breastfeeding, recent cardiovascular distress, or phenylketonuria) will be excluded.
             We have chosen to exclude patients with a diagnosis of depression, due to confounding
             factors.

        Adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children,
        teenagers), and prisoners will be excluded from this study. The Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA) advises caution for nicotine lozenge use among women who are pregnant.
        Thus, women who are pregnant at the time of baseline will be excluded from the study.
