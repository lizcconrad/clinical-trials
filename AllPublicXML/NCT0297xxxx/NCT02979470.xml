  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main reason of cancer-related mortality is the spread of cancer cells to distant sites
      (micrometastases). However, only a few small groups of tumor cells can metastasize by
      acquiring mechanism to decrease the immune response. Changes in the systemic inflammatory
      response to the tumor can be measured by blood-based parameters. In particular, the
      proportion of neutrophyls- lymphocytes (NL) has been evaluated for predicting the survival of
      patients with different types of cancer. The first strategy to treat colorectal cancer (CCR)
      is complete resection of the lesion. Nevertheless, some patients experience recurrence,
      probably due to residual micrometastases. We have demonstrated that analysis of some
      resistance proteins (Tyms / MRP1) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may predict treatment
      response in metastatic CCR patients (mCRC). We also note that the CTCs kinetics can show
      response to therapy. Patients with stage III disease in the colon / rectum, although showing
      high cure rate, generally fall locally or remotely and studies with blood markers in this
      group of patients is still scarce. Primary Objective: To investigate cells found in the blood
      (lymphocytes and neutrophils and CTCs) to verify if they can help in the choice of
      anti-neoplastic therapy in patients with advanced colon and rectum cancers. Secondary
      objectives: - to evaluate the influence of CTC kinetics in response to treatment of patients
      with advanced colon/rectum cancers; - to check the expression of treatment resistance,
      invasion and proliferation proteins (Tyms, TGF-βR, MMP-2, β-gal, Ki-67 and CD45) in CTCs and
      their correlation with response to treatment; - to check the mRNA expression of the same
      genes observed by immunocytochemistry in CTCs and their correlation with response to
      treatment; - to quantify CTCs, neutrophils and lymphocytes of patients included in this study
      and verify if there are correlation among their rates and progression-free survival. Methods:
      there will be collected 10 ml of blood of patients with advanced colon and rectal cancer for
      analysis of CTCs, lymphocytes / neutrophils. CTCs will be isolated, quantified and analyzed
      after separation by ISET method (Rarecells/France). The marker analysis of these cells will
      be done by immunocytochemistry and the gene expression will be assessed by RNAscope. The
      quantification of lymphocytes/neutrophils will be made by common blood count in Delboni
      laboratory. Expected Results: We propose to show that not only the count and the kinetics of
      CTCs, but also their molecular characteristics, can provide relevant information to
      clinicians. Hopefully, by quantification of neutrophils and lymphocytes, we will be able to
      identify new prognostic blood biomarkers that can direct clinicians to the best therapeutic
      choice.
