  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential value of a novel imaging technique
      (hyperpolarized 129Xe lung imaging) in the diagnosis and assessment of lung disease in
      patients with COPD and IPF.

    <description>Subjects will receive 1L non-hyperpolarised 129Xenon to inhale. Then:Subjects will inhale the first hyperpolarised 129Xenon calibration dose (up to 1L, which may be a mix of hyperpolarised 129Xenon and N2) and hold their breath while the MRI scan is performed. Then:A further series of inhalations will be performed up to a maximum of 3 (maximum total exposure to hyperpolarised 129Xenon will be 3.6L). Optional Study Visit #2:Identical to Study Visit 1 but with the further series of inhalations being up to a maximum of 4 (maximum total exposure to hyperpolarised 129Xenon will be 5L).Optional Study Visit #3: Identical to Study Visit 2 (maximum total exposure to hyperpolarised 129Xenon will be 5L)</description>
