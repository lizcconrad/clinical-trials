      This is a phase I/II open label, randomized, interventional clinical trial. Study eyes will
      receive one preoperative intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) &lt;21 days but &gt;7 days prior
      to vitrectomy and one intraoperative IAI at end of surgery followed by randomization in a 1:1
      ratio into either 4 mandatory postoperative q4weeks IAI followed by mandatory q8 weeks IAI
      for 52 weeks follow-up (q8 week Group) or 2 mandatory postoperative q4weeks IAI followed by
      mandatory q16 weeks IAI for 52 weeks follow-up (q16 week Group).

      This is a phase I/II open label, randomized, interventional clinical trial. Study eyes will
      receive one preoperative intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) &lt;21 days but &gt;7 days prior
      to vitrectomy and one intraoperative intravitreal aflibercept at end of surgery followed by
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio into either 4 mandatory postoperative q4weeks IAI followed by
      mandatory q8 weeks IAI for 52 weeks follow-up (q8 week Group) or 2 mandatory postoperative
      q4weeks IAI followed by mandatory q16 weeks IAI for 52 weeks follow-up (q16 week Group).

      Follow-up visits occur 1 day and 1-2 weeks, and 4 weeks postoperatively and then every 4
      weeks from the first postoperative IAI for 52 weeks. One preoperative visit and every
      postoperative visit (except day one postoperatively) will include ETDRS Best Corrected Visual
      Acuity (BCVA), Intraocular Pressure (IOP) measurement, Slit lamp biomicroscopy, Indirect
      ophthalmoscopy, Heidelberg Spectralis Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)
      (no OCT for preoperative visit) and evaluation for systemic and ocular adverse events. Seven
      standard field photographs and Optos wide-field fluorescein angiography will be performed at
      postoperative visits at 4, 16, 28, 40,and 52 weeks. Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing (30-2
      and 60-4 test patterns) will be performed at postoperative visits at 4 and 52 weeks.
      Preoperative B scan echography will be required standard of care(SOC) to assess for macular
      traction, non-macular traction, retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage(VH).
      Identification of traction macular detachment will exclude the patient from the study.

          8. History or evidence for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the study eye

             blepharitis, chalazion etc)

         11. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in the study eye &lt;4weeks from enrollment.

         12. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         13. Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to

             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device
             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly) *Contraception is not
             required for men with documented vasectomy. **Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of child bearing potential.
             Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation.
