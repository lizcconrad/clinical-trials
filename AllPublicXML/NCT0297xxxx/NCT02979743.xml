      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between brain MRI-metrics and hand
      function observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP),compared between baseline and the
      third month, and thus determine the early MRI-based neuroimaging predictor of clinical
      improvement following therapy in children with CP.

      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the commonest cause of neurological disability in children. The upper
      limbs are often affected, with significant hand involvement from an early age.There are
      various methods of treatment for CP children with hand function disability. However, there is
      a lack of effective methods to predict the prognosis.

      This prospective cohort study will include children with occupational therapy (OT) or OT plus
      acupuncture and massage methods. Children with CP will be evaluated in terms of upper limb
      motor function using the manual ability classification system (MACS), fine motor function
      measure (FMFM). The Brain injuries of Children will be evaluated by MRI.

      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between brain MRI-metrics and hand
      function, compared between baseline and the third month, and thus determine the early
      MRI-based neuroimaging predictors of clinical improvements following therapy in children with
      CP.

        Cerebral palsy (CP) is the commonest cause of neurological disability in children. Spastic
        cerebral palsy is the type of CP wherein spasticity is either the dominant or exclusive
        impairment present. It is by far the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring
        in 90% of all cases according to the Society for Cerebral Palsy in Europe. People with the
        spastic/spasticity type of CP are hypertonic—i.e., they present with very stiff and tight
        muscle groups, far greater than typical humans—and have what is essentially a neuromuscular
        mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) which stems from an upper motor
        neuron lesion in the brain. The corticospinal tract or the motor cortex may be secondarily
        affected.
