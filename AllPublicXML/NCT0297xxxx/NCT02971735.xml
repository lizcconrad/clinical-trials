      New designs of 6-year undergraduate medical education (UME) in Taiwan mainly include (1)
      integral curricula of body organ system, (2) multiple methods of clinical teaching and
      assessment, and (3) generalism in UME. Accompany with decreasing educational hours in the
      classrooms and hospital, essential but minor components of primary healthcare such as
      ophthalmology and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) is disproportionately
      under-represented in UME. Novel medical education stresses on enabling self-directory
      learning and increasing learning hours outside the classrooms. Accordingly, we hypothesize
      that innovations in educational technology can enhance the learning outcomes of ORL-HNS. This
      study is aimed to determine whether mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) is an effective
      tool for the instruction of ORL-HNS and to compare effects of different cognitive styles on
      learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education. This is a randomized
      controlled trial. We will recruit 60 UME students without previous training in ORL-HNS to
      undergo the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their cognitive styles such as field
      dependence or field-independence. After blinded randomization, students are instructed on two
      modules of emergent ORL-HNS disorders, using either a standard e-learning of text-figure
      Power Point show or an interactive multimedia module. Subjects are evaluated on emergent
      ORL-HNS disorders using text-based assessment and multimedia assessment take place prior to
      and following instruction. After 7 days later, they will be assessed using global
      satisfaction score and AttrakDiff2 questionnaire. We anticipate that this study can confirm
      M-TEL can enhance the efficiency of the instruction of ORL-HNS and understand differences in
      learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education between field dependence
      and filed independence using this platform.

      Background:

      New designs of 6-year undergraduate medical education (UME) mainly include (1) integral
      curricula of body organ system, (2) multiple methods of clinical teaching and assessment, and
      (3) generalism in UME. UME is meant to enable graduates to become undifferentiated general
      physicians. Accompany with decreasing educational hours in the classrooms and hospital,
      essential but minor components of primary healthcare such as ophthalmology and
      otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) is disproportionately under-represented in
      UME. In Canada, substantial downstream effects on managing ORL-HNS problems have been noted
      in family medicine residents. In order to improve learning insufficiency and enhance clinical
      competency without increasing extra-hours in the classrooms and hospitals, novel medical
      education stresses on enabling self-directory learning and increasing learning hours outside
      the classrooms. Accordingly, we hypothesize that innovations in educational technology can
      enhance the learning outcomes of ORL-HNS.

      Purposes: This study is aimed to determine whether mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) is
      an effective tool for the instruction of ORL-HNS and to compare effects of different
      cognitive styles on learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education.

      Material and Methods:

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Firstly, we have been setup a e-learning platform of
      the Top 10 emergent ORL-HNS disorders with translating into an application (APP) function
      that can execute in mobile devices. Secondly, we will recruit 60 UME students without
      previous training in ORL-HNS to undergo the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their
      cognitive styles such as field dependence or field-independence. After blinded randomization,
      students are instructed on two modules of emergent ORL-HNS disorders, using either a standard
      e-learning of text-figure Power Point show or an interactive multimedia module. Subjects are
      evaluated on emergent ORL-HNS disorders using a text-based assessment and a multimedia
      assessment take place prior to and following instruction.

      Anticipating Outcome:

      This study can (1) establish a M-TEL of ORL-HNS that can deliver an innovatively mobile
      e-learning to supplement the deficiency of the classroom hours, (2) confirm M-TEL can enhance
      the efficiency of the instruction of ORL-HNS, and (3) understand differences in learning
      outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education between field dependence and
      filed independence using this platform.

    <description>For more delicately evaluate the acceptance of technical innovations, we will assess &quot;user experience&quot; using the AttrakDiff2. AttrakDiff2 is developed as a tool by Hassenzahl's research group to be able to quantify attractive, identifiable, stimulating, and pragmatic qualities. The tool uses 4x7 anchor scales, in total 28 questions. The anchors are presented in the form of semantic differentials and a 7-point Likert scale is employed for rating the intensity of the items. Each of the mean values of an item group creates a scale value for pragmatic quality (PQ), hedonic stimulation (HQ-S), hedonic identification (HQ-I), and attractiveness (ATT).</description>
