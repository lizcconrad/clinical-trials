        Inclusion Criteria:

        Group A:

        Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if ALL of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Clear cell and non-clear
             cell carcinoma (such as papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, and medullary)
             allowed.

          2. Evidence of metastatic disease in any site on most recent imaging scan

          3. Planned initiation of treatment with immune modulatory agent targeting any of the
             following: PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, CD27, OX40, or LAG3

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Group B:

        Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if ALL of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Non-transitional cell
             carcinoma (such as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) allowed.

          2. Evidence of metastatic disease in any site on most recent imaging scan

          3. Planned initiation of treatment with immune modulatory agent targeting any of the
             following: PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, CD27, OX40, or LAG3

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
             participation in a blood drawing protocol difficult or not feasible at the discretion
             of the principal investigator or co-investigator(s).

          2. Treatment with systemic steroids of any dose or formulation (including hydrocortisone,
             prednisone, methylprednisolone (Solumedrol), dexamethasone), within 4 weeks of consent
             or planned initiation of steroids after consent (unplanned steroid initiation for
             treatment of immune related adverse events is allowed). Chronic treatment with
             steroids for physiological replacement for adrenal insufficiency is allowed.

          3. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents (including mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept),
             mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic), rituximab (Rituxan), tacrolimus (Prograf), sirolimus
             (Rapamune), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), TNF-a inhibitors such as infliximab, etanercept
             or adalimumab, methotrexate, azathioprine, and dactinomycin) within 4 weeks of consent
             or planned initiation of any of these agents for 12 weeks after consent.
