  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation has become one of the most important supportive treatment methods to
      save the life of critically ill children over time. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is
      a common complication of mechanical ventilation. It is one of the leading causes of
      hospital-acquired infections in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).VAP can aggravate
      patients' condition and have adverse effect on mechanical ventilation. Moreover, VAP is
      associated with significant increased mortality. In those critical ill patients, the
      catabolism increased, the anabolism decreased, which can induce negative nitrogen balance.
      The consensus of optimal nutrition therapy in pediatric critical care in the Asia-Pacific,
      released in 2014, clearly recommended that early enteral nutrition support, which begin
      within 24-48 hours after admitting in PICU, can significantly reduce the prevalence and
      mortality of nosocomial infection. Intermittent enteral feeding and continual enteral feeding
      are the most common methods of enteral nutrition at present. There is no final conclusion
      about the association between enteral nutrition methods and VAP. Thus, the relationship
      between enteral feeding and VAP has long been a controversial issue. There is little clinical
      research on the correlation between enteral nutrition and VAP in children with mechanical
      ventilation, and mostly were observational studies which lacks strong evidence. How to choose
      the appropriate enteral nutrition remains an urgent need in PICU clinical work. Therefore, it
      is necessary for us to analyze the relationship between enteral feeding and VAP in critically
      ill children. This study would perform a two-year research with mechanical ventilated
      patients in PICU of four children hospitals in Shanghai, which aim to determine the
      relationship between different enteral feeding methods and VAP, to collect the baseline
      characteristic data of ventilated children, to analyze the risk factors for VAP in PICU
      patients. The results from our study would contribute to improving the standard of care for
      children undergoing mechanical ventilation, reducing their lung injury and improving
      prognosis.

      With the development and advancement of modern medical technology, mechanical ventilation has
      become one of the most important supportive treatment methods to save the life of critically
      ill children. Ventilator-associated pneumonia （VAP） is a common complication of mechanical
      ventilation. It is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections in the PICU. VAP
      can aggravate patients' condition and have adverse effect on mechanical ventilation. An
      overseas study reported that VAP increased 56% of the PICU length of stay and 43% of the
      length of hospitalization. Moreover, VAP is associated with significant increased mortality.
      Because the prevalence and mortality of VAP vary in adult and children, also in different
      area, it is very necessary to investigate the current status of VAP in local children, which
      can contribute to clinical prevention and treatment to decrease mortality. Appropriate
      nutrition support can improve the body's metabolism, promote tissue and body function repair,
      reduce the incidence of complications. However, inadequate enteral nutrition may cause
      gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration, which may lead to VAP and exacerbate the condition.
      Intermittent enteral feeding and continual enteral feeding are the most common methods of
      enteral nutrition at present. The relationship between enteral feeding methods and VAP has
      long been a controversial issue. There is little clinical research on the correlation between
      enteral feeding and VAP in children with mechanical ventilation, and mostly were
      observational studies which lacks strong evidence. How to choose the appropriate enteral
      nutrition remains an urgent need in PICU clinical work. Therefore, it is necessary for us to
      analyze the relationship between enteral feeding and VAP in critically ill children.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the influence of intermittent or
      continuous enteral feeding on VAP in PICUs. The secondary objectives are to collect the
      baseline characteristic data of ventilated children, and to analyze the risk factors of VAP
      in children. Each patient will be randomly assigned to an intermittent or continuous enteral
      feeding schedule. Intermittent enteral feeding schedule: feed administered via the
      nasogastric tube less than 30 mins. Continuous enteral feeding schedule: feed pump delivered
      via the nasogastric tube over 24 hours. Data on feeding progression, respiratory status and
      incidence of VAP will be collected and compared. The study will also collect data on baseline
      characters, ventilation management, ventilated days and the time to discharge from the
      hospital.
