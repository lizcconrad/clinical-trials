  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation (heterotopic ossification or HO) in muscles, tendons, and
      ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue
      trauma, vaccinations, or influenza infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict
      movement by locking joints leading to cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse
      models of FOP have demonstrated the ability of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonists
      such as palovarotene (PVO) to prevent HO following injury. This 24-month study will (1)
      continue to follow FOP subjects from France who completed Clementia Study PVO-1A-201; (2)
      enroll up to eight additional new French subjects who have achieved at least 90% skeletal
      maturity; and (3) evaluate the ability of different palovarotene dosing regimens to prevent
      HO in these subjects.

      The main objective of this Phase 2, open-label study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of different palovarotene dosing regimens in subjects with FOP in France.

      Adult Cohort subjects (those with at least 90% skeletal maturity) will be treated with 5 mg
      palovarotene daily for up to 24 months. Site visits will occur at baseline/screening and at
      Study Months 12 and 24; subjects will also be contacted by telephone every 3 months.

      In the event of an eligible flare-up, Adult Cohort subjects will receive 20 mg palovarotene
      daily for 28 days, followed by 10 mg for 56 days. Dosing may be extended if the flare-up is
      not resolved by Flare-up Day 84 and continue until the flare-up resolves (at the
      end-of-treatment [EOT]). Dose reduction, as directed by the Investigator, may occur in the
      event of intolerable side effects.

      The flare-up based dosing regimen for Pediatric Cohort subjects (those with less than 90%
      skeletal maturity) will be the same as for Adult Cohort subjects except doses will adjusted
      for weight. Pediatric subjects will not receive non-flare-up daily dosing until preliminary
      efficacy and safety data are obtained in the Adult Cohort. Site visits will occur at Flare-up
      Baseline and at Flare-up Day 84/EOT; subjects will also be contacted by telephone every 2
      weeks.
