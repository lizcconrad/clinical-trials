  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the short-term and long-term effects of
      transcutaneous pulsed radio frequency treatment on the physiological status, subjective
      well-being, and on the intensity of pain. Category A Transcutaneous Pulsed Radiofrequency is
      a method that is widely used for control of pain. There are no known complications. In this
      study a Radiofrequency generator will be used that has a separate outlet for transcutaneous
      use. Patients will be recruited within the clinic population of patients.

      Data will be assessed in at three times, the baseline testing, the first and the second
      follow-up meeting (+2-4 days of intervention; as well as + 40 days via post/email)

      The inclusion criteria are: Inclusion:

        -  age 18 - 65

        -  chronic pain (Duration of three Months or more) patients of the Pain Center Nottwil,
           Swiss Paraplegic Center

      The following criteria will lead to an exclusion of the study:

        -  severe medical issues, such as cancer or comparable diseases

        -  severe mental disorders such as severe depression or schizophrenia

        -  patients with pacemakers or with atrial fibrillation

        -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding The primary outcome assessed is the
           physiological status, assessed by the heart rate variability (HRV). Secondary outcomes
           are the subjective well-being, as assessed by the &quot;Marburger questionnaire regarding
           habitual well-being&quot; (FW-7) questionnaire as well as the intensity of pain, as assessed
           by the numeric rating scale for pain intensity (NRS) score and by a 7-point Likert
           scale.

    <description>According to the standard application of the device, for the PRF procedure one 5 x 13 cm skin electrode will be placed over the forehead, the other one over the posterior aspect of the neck. PRF with a duty load of 14.8 msec/sec and an average pulse frequency of 5.11 Hz will be applied for 25min. The voltage will be set to generate a current of 1 A.
Voltage and impedance will be monitored continuously during treatment and if necessary the voltage will be corrected to ensure the proper current.</description>
