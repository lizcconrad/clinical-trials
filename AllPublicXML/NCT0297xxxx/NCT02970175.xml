  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the
      location and the histological type of the lesion, as well as on the number of biopsy samples
      performed. The increasing number of sampling is also important to provide material for
      molecular assessment of lung cancer. The French National Institute for Cancer recommends a
      number of 5 biopsies in order to reach a diagnostic yield of 88%. However, as increasing the
      number of bronchial biopsies comes with a higher risk of bleeding, the management of
      endobronchial bleeding may be determinant for the diagnostic yield.

      The most recent recommendations of the British Thoracic Society for the management of
      bronchial bleeding, after bronchial or transbronchial biopsy, are to inject 5 to 10 mL of
      1/10000 diluted adrenalin, or cold saline serum (04°C.). The French guidelines also include
      the use of endobronchial terlipressin, which has local vasoconstriction effect. After
      endobronchial administration of terlipressin, plasmatic concentrations are low, and are not
      clinically relevant.

      The hypothesis of this clinical trial is that endobronchial instillation of terlipressin
      before sampling endobronchial tumor will limit the endobronchial bleeding and allow to
      increase the number of biopsies performed and, eventually, the diagnostic yield.
