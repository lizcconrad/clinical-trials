  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Applying flapless piezocision corticotomies on the alveolar bone and separating anterior
      mandibular teeth using a piezosurgery device (i.e. ultrasonic waves that perform very
      accurate incisions without any sutures following this procedure) may improve the speed of
      tooth alignment during orthodontic treatment. This study consists of two groups, patients
      will be randomly assigned to one of these two groups. The levels of pain and discomfort of
      this procedure on 18 patients (experimental group) will be evaluated,whereas the second group
      (control group) will receive a traditional orthodontic therapy.

    <textblock>
      According to the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), the length of comprehensive
      orthodontic treatment ranges between 18-30 months, depending on treatment options and
      individual characteristics. In addition, orthodontic treatment time ranges between 25-35
      months for extraction therapies, respectively. Reducing orthodontic treatment time is one of
      the main goals for orthodontists, due to problems such as root resorption, periodontal
      disease and caries that are associated with prolonged treatment time.

      Many techniques have been introduced to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement; surgical and
      non-surgical. The surgical approach is the most clinically applied and most tested with known
      predictions and stable results. Surgical approaches usually vary from total block osteotomies
      to flapless partial corticotomies .In spite of corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment
      efficiency, the invasiveness of these procedures (i.e. requiring full mucoperiosteal flaps
      elevation) might have limited their widespread acceptance among orthodontists and patients.
      Therefore, more conservative flapless corticotomy techniques have recently been proposed.
      These procedures can be accomplished in a reasonably short periods that might produce less
      pain and discomfort, so we will gain better patient acceptance. Although various techniques
      of flapless corticotomy have been reported to be successful in practice, scientific evidence
      on their acceptance and compatibility is little in the literature.
