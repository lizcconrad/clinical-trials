  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In urologic robotic surgery with steep Trendelenburg position, maintenance of cardiac preload
      and cardiac output is important for clinical prognosis. Previous studies reported the
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced increase in central venous pressure (CVP)
      could be a accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients. The
      authors attempt to evaluate the predictability of PEEP-induced increase in CVP as well as
      stroke volume variation in urologic robotic surgery with Steep Trendelenburg position.

    <textblock>
      In urologic robotic surgery with steep Trendelenburg position, maintenance of cardiac preload
      and cardiac output is important for clinical prognosis. As a preload index, the
      predictability of central venous pressure, pulse pressure variation and stroke volume
      variations may be impaired due to the impaired hemodynamics that result from the effect of
      increased abdominal pressure and decreased venous return. Previous studies reported the
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced increase in central venous pressure (CVP)
      could be a accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients.
      Therefore, the authors attempt to evaluate the predictability of PEEP-induced increase in CVP
      as well as stroke volume variation in urologic robotic surgery with Steep Trendelenburg
      position.

    <description>First, apply 10 cmH2O positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) and measure the increase in central venous pressure (CVP) as well as other preload indexes (central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, stroke volume variation).
Second, measure the increase in cardiac index after administration of volulyte 300 ml.
If cardiac index increase more than 10%, fluid responsiveness is confirmed.</description>
