      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in outcomes between
      liberal transfusion (transfusing when hemoglobin drops below a set higher value number) and
      conservative transfusion (transfusing when hemoglobin drops below a set lower value number).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion of Orthopaedic trauma patients is routinely done in asymptomatic individuals as
      there is no accepted national standard or recommendations from the American Academy of
      Orthopaedic Surgeons or the Orthopaedic Trauma Association for what level of anemia is
      appropriate in an asymptomatic patient. Individual practitioners typically make this decision
      based on anecdotal experiences and expert opinion. No prospective study has been performed to
      date to answer this question in this patient population.

      The null hypothesis of this proposed pilot study is that no difference will be seen with a
      liberal transfusion strategy to keep a patient's hemoglobin above 7 g/dL versus a
      conservative strategy to keep the patient's hemoglobin above 5.5 g/dL in patients
      asymptomatic at rest. The primary outcome of this pilot study will be infection; defined as
      postoperative wound infection (superficial or deep) or other perioperative infection but not
      surgical site (urinary tract infection or pneumonia). Deep infection is defined as the need
      for intravenous antibiotics or a return to surgery for debridement. Superficial infection is
      defined as the use of oral antibiotics only successfully treat a surgical site infection.
      Secondary outcomes will include pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, acute renal
      failure or insufficiency, nonunion, delayed union, compartment syndrome, osteomyelitis, nerve
      palsy, anoxic brain injury, cardiac ischemia or infarct, pancreatitis, or death, and the
      musculoskeletal functional assessment.

    <description>Randomization would not occur until the patient's Hgb dropped below 7 g/dL. If the patient is randomized to the liberal arm, they would be transfused to keep their Hgb &gt;7 g/dL. If the patient is randomized to the conservative arm, they would not be transfused until their Hgb drops below 5.5 g/dL. If the patient's Hgb does not drop below 7.0 g/dL, randomization will not be done.</description>

             longer within the resuscitation phase of initial treatment. This is defined as a
             normal urine output (greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hr) and a systolic blood pressure greater
             than 90 mmHg for greater than 6 hours without fluid bolus or transfusion during that
             time
