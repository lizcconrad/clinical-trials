      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine on
      participant goal achievement after a change in antidepressant medication for the treatment of
      major depressive disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested to
      treat depression in people who have major depressive disorder. This study will look at
      effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine in participant's goal achievement for the
      treatment of major depressive disorder.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients. Participants will receive:

      • Vortioxetine 10 to 20 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. The participants will receive a starting dose of 10 mg. The dose may be up-titrated to
      20 mg. The dose may then be decreased by 5 mg based on participant's response and
      tolerability to higher dose as judged by the Investigator.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Unites States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 19 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone for 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) Score of ≥50 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>GAS is a tool to measure progress each participant has towards achieving their individualized goals. The standardized scoring will be applied for statistical analysis. A semi-structured interview will be conducted with each participant to conduct goal-setting at the outset of study. Another evaluation will take place at End of Study (EOS) visit to determine the level of progress at that time. The score for each goal ranges from -2 (much worse) to +2 (much better). GAS yields a norm-based score standardized to a mean of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher score means improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a well-established participant reported outcome tool for assessment of change in depressive symptoms and is a sensitive measure of depression severity. The PHQ-9 consists of a 9-item scale originally developed for primary care settings, with 1 item corresponding to each of the 9 made symptom criteria for depression in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), asking if they have bothered the participant over the last 2 weeks. Each question is rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). If any problems are answered 1 or higher, a final question on how difficult those problems made it to do work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people is completed, rated from not difficult at all to extremely difficult. The 9 questions are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 27 with higher scores reflecting greater severity. The change between the PHQ-9 Score collected at Weeks 6 and 12 relative to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D) at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>PDQ-D consists of 20 items that construct four domains of cognitive function: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and organization/planning. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale anchored from never (0) to almost always (4). The total scores for PDQ-D is sum of the scores for the 5 items (0 to 20) where higher score indicates more severe cognitive dysfunction. The change between the PDQ-D Score collected at Weeks 6 and 12 relative to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Scale (Q-LES-Q) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Q-LES-Q is a scale designed to allow researchers to assess the degree of a participant's quality of life in various areas of daily living. Ninety-one of the 93 items are assembled into 8 categories: physical health/activities, feelings, work, household duties, school/course work, leisure time activities, social relations, and general activities. Items are scored on a 5 point scale, from 1 (not at all or never) to 5 (frequently or all the time), to indicate the degree of enjoyment or satisfaction experienced. The total score ranges from 0 to 465. Higher scores indicate greater enjoyment/satisfaction. The change between the Q-LES-Q Score collected at Week 12 relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 5-Item World Health Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WHO-5 is a short, self-administered questionnaire covering 5 positively worded items, related to positive mood (good spirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested), and general interests (being interested in things). Each of the five items is rated from 0 (= not present) to 5 (= constantly present). Scores are summated, with raw score ranging from 0 to 25. Then the scores are transformed to 0-100 by multiplying by 4, with higher score meaning better well-being. The change between the WHO-5 Score collected at Week 12 relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale Severity (CGI-S) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a clinician rated scale designed to assess global severity of illness and change in the clinical condition over time. The CGI-S provides the clinician's impression of the participant's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this participant population to rate the severity of the participant's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal-not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The change between the CGI-S Score collected at Week 12 relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participant's condition relative to Baseline (Randomization/Day 1) on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness. The change between the CGI-I Score collected at Week 12 relative to baseline.</description>
