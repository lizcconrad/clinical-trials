      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of high intensity laser therapy in
      the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain has a high prevalence in our society, several studies estimate an annual
      prevalence between 5% and 47%. It is one of the main causes of musculoskeletal pain,
      particularly in third place, after the low back pain and neck pain.

      Symptoms of pathologies of subacromial space impingement syndrome, where, regardless of
      origin, pain is the number one symptom for the patient, which emanates functional impairment
      and the impact on quality of life. Because of the need to implement research to assess the
      effectiveness of high intensity laser therapy with new studies mayor methodological quality
      of obtaining conclusive results, and based on the scientific evidence supporting the
      low-power laser therapy as a useful tool in addressing the shoulder tendon pathology, we
      consider very interesting the realization of this research project.
