    <textblock>
      This study assessed the efficacy and safety of generic imatinib in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML) in Jordan. It was a multicenter, non-interventional, open-label,
      prospective study combined with retrospective data collection from files of patients with a
      diagnosis of Ph+ CML, treated with Cemivil (imatinib), where no visits or intervention(s)
      additional to the daily practice were performed

      Primary objectives

      Measure the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in CP treated
      with Cemivil who achieve optimal response :

        -  Complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months;

        -  Minor cytogenetic response (mCyR) at 3 months (Ph+ ≤65%); partial cytogenetic response
           (PCyR) at 6 months (Ph+ ≤35%), and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months (No
           Ph+ metaphases);

        -  Major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months of Cemivil therapy [a ratio of BCR-ABL1 to
           ABL1 ≤0.1% on the International Scale];

      Assess the safety and tolerability of Cemivil after one year of treatment, based on:

        -  Incidence, severity, and relationship of adverse events (AEs) to the study medication;

        -  Serious AEs;

        -  AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation;

        -  Clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests (according to laboratory reference
           ranges).

      Number of Subjects evaluated: 91 (N=33 received generic imatinib as first-line therapy
      &quot;first-line patients&quot;. N=58 switched from patented imatinib to generic imatinib &quot;switched
      patients&quot;)
