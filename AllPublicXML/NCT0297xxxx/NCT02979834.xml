      This study aims to investigate average gestational week in which mothers feel the
      babies'movements for the first time and maternal-fetal factors affecting this time.

      Most of the obstetricians face the question; &quot;When Will I Feel The First Movements of My
      Baby?&quot;, in daily practice. It becomes a challenge for the obstetrician to answer this
      question. Because, there is not a sufficient data in the current literature on this issue. A
      broad range of weeks for fetal quickening are reported as 16th to 20th weeks, in round
      figures. So, when a woman in the 21st gestational week , asks this question to the
      obstetrician and informed according to aforementioned literature knowledge, the woman will
      ask another question immediately after: &quot;What is the problem with my baby?&quot;. But, the
      obstetrician will not be able to give an assuring answer because of the lack of knowledge in
      the current literature.Thus, to cope with such a clinical situation, the investigators
      decided to investigate the average week in which pregnant women in a low risk population,
      felt the babies' movements for the first time and to find out the affects of probable factors
      which may act on this time.

        Three groups were formed according to the gestational week in which fetal movements felt by
        mother for the first time. 25th percentile, 50thand 75th percentile values were determined
        .Participants who felt the babies' movements at or before 25th percentile value constituted
        Group1 or early perception group, participants who felt the babies' movements between 25th
        and 75th percentile value constituted Group 2 or average perception group and the
        participants who felt the babies'movements at or beyond 75th value constituted Group 3 or
        late perception group. Subsequently, these three groups were compared regarding maternal
        age, gestational week of inclusion in the study, obstetric features, maternal body mass
        index values, caffeine consumption, smoking status, maternal education status, placental
        localization and fetal gender.
