  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this proposal are to implement SCNIP in 6 Northgate Gonzalez Markets
      across San Diego, Orange and LA counties (2 in each county), and determine which level of
      financial incentive rebate (specifically, $10/month, $20/month, or $40/month) optimally
      increases the purchase and consumption of SNAP eligible fruits and vegetables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University of California San Diego (UCSD) Center for Community Health, in collaboration
      with Northgate Gonzalez Markets and its regional partners, will implement a Food Insecurity
      Nutrition Incentive program in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties - the Southern
      California Nutrition Incentive Program (SCNIP). This program will develop, implement and
      evaluate a multi-tiered model that will enable low-income, SNAP-eligible consumers to make
      healthier food choices and purchase more fruits and vegetables. This model will include: tier
      1) an innovative fruit and vegetable financial incentive rebate program that utilizes the
      consumer's Northgate Gonzalez Market customer loyalty card, electronic benefit transfer (EBT)
      card, and electronic wallet (e-wallet); tier 2) fruit and vegetable promotions that include
      discount pricing; and tier 3) SNAP-Ed programming (e.g., in-store cooking classes, tours, and
      healthy food self-labeling system) to educate and support the purchasing behaviors of
      SNAP-eligible families. Through the use of the customer loyalty card, EBT card, and e-wallet,
      the rebate program will be able to track the purchase of SCNIP eligible fruits and vegetables
      and provide a rebate at the point-of-sale that can be used to purchase additional fruits and
      vegetables, thus increasing the purchasing power of SNAP-eligible families for healthy food
      options. Earned and dispensed rebate dollars will be stored on the e-wallet enabling the
      tracking of purchasing behaviors and dollars spent on healthy fruits and vegetables in this
      program. With this data, we will be able to determine what level of financial incentive
      rebate ($10/month, $20/month, or $40/month) (tier 1) optimally increased SNAP families' per
      capita spending on fruits and vegetables in conjunction with the fruit and vegetable
      promotions (tier 2) and nutrition education activities (tier 3).
