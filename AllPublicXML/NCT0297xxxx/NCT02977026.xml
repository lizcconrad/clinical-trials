  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is one of the leading contributors to premature mortality and disability. Most people
      with alcohol problems will never seek treatment. There is a need to develop alternate ways to
      help problem drinkers outside of formal treatment settings.

      One promising strategy is Internet-based interventions for problem drinkers. Our recently
      completed RCT comparing a brief (Check Your Drinking; CYD) versus an extended (Alcohol Help
      Centre; AHC) Internet intervention for problem drinkers found that, while there was a
      reduction in drinking across time for both interventions, there was no significant (p &gt; .05)
      difference in reductions in drinking between the two interventions. Based on these results,
      it is not justifiable to say that either intervention 'worked' as there was no comparison
      condition of participants who received no active intervention. The current trial proposes to
      address this limitation by conducting an RCT comparing the CYD, AHC, and a no intervention
      control condition.

      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Participants
      identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to complete another
      survey in 6 months time. Those who are interested will be randomized to receive access to the
      Check Your Drinking screener (CYD condition), Alcohol Help Centre (AHC condition) or a
      feedback questionnaire (control condition). At six-months post-baseline, the MTurk portal
      will be used to send invitation emails that contain a link to the follow-up survey. The
      primary hypothesis to be tested is that participants receiving access to the AHC intervention
      will report a greater reduction in AUDIT-C scores and in number of drinks in a typical week
      than participants in the CYD intervention. Further, participants in the CYD condition will
      report a greater level of reduction AUDIT-C scores and in number of drinks in a typical week
      between the baseline survey and six-month follow-up as compared to participants in the no
      intervention control condition.
