      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of LY3305677 and any side effects that
      might be associated with it.

      This study will also look at how much LY3305677 gets into the blood stream, how long it takes
      the body to remove it.

      This study involves a single dose of LY3305677 administered by subcutaneous injection (SC).

      Participation in this study is expected to last up to 16 weeks.
