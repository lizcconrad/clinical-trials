  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levels of overweight and obesity have reached alarming proportions in Qatar and other Gulf
      nations. In Qatar, the need to establish national strategies for the prevention and treatment
      of obesity has been recognized in the new Qatar National Health Strategy 2011-2016, which
      stresses the need for prevention. In fact, the Qatar National Nutrition and Physical Activity
      Action Plan 2011-2016 calls for nutrition and physical activity interventions for the
      prevention of obesity and related chronic diseases such as diabetes. The treatment and
      prevention of childhood obesity is largely through lifestyle changes- encouraging health
      eating and physical activity and discouraging sedentary behavior. However, changing such
      behaviors is complex and requires a combination of integrated approaches to tackle such a
      multifaceted problem. Herein, the investigators set out to implement and evaluate a novel
      weight management program for Qatari school children at the vulnerable age of 9-12 years. The
      project incorporates a cognitive-behavioral approach that involves developing social and
      emotional competences, promotion healthy dietary habits, development of physical literacy,
      and use of activity monitoring devices to promote increased activity while enlisting family
      involvement in an attempt to maintain weight loss in the long term. This project seeks to
      also take things further by integrating a range of interventions that use cutting edge
      insights from the behavioral sciences through the use of MINDSPACE approach (MINDSPACE:
      Messenger, Incentive, Norms, Default, Salience, Priming, Affect, Commitment, Ego) in
      conjunction with technology tools for monitoring activity and providing ongoing support
      through the use of social media. The intervention involves a multi-cohort intervention
      involving 500 Qatari children over 5 years to be conducted in three phases (1) intensive
      weight loss camps, (2) after-school clubs as supplement/consolidation, and (3) maintenance
      through web and social/family support.

      The specific objectives of the project are to:

        1. Adapt and pilot a school-based intervention that combines behavioral and cognitive
           approaches to promote healthy lifestyle among 9-12 year old children in select Qatari
           schools in the first year;

        2. Integrate behavioral economics and cognitive behavioral therapy (MINDSPACE) in a
           multi-cohort prevention/intervention study targeting at risk Qatari school children at
           the vulnerable age range of 9-12;

        3. Select and use technological tools for enhanced outcomes and adoption of the
           intervention nationally;

        4. Package study findings into a lifestyle change intervention for national implementation
           in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation and the Supreme Education Council.

      Data from this project could provide the basis for a national program to stem the rise of
      obesity in Qatar through lifestyle changes and reduce related health conditions.

    <measure>Weight loss</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weight loss will be assessed by measurement of Body Mass Index (BMI, expressed in kg/m^2, weight in kilograms, height in meters) at baseline (Day 1 of week 1), post camp (week 3), post clubs (week 14), and post maintenance/end of intervention (week 26). Change in BMI Standard Deviation Scores (SDS) between baseline and week 26 will be used as indicator of effectiveness of intervention compared to BMI-SDS for the control group. One year follow up of change in BMI-SDS for intervention and control groups will gauge the long term benefits of the intervention. A multilevel mixed effects model will be used to assess both individual- (fixed effects) and school-level (random) effects, including covariates, such as demographic factors of the children and time (cohort). BMI SDS will be evaluated to determine mean differences and the proportions of children with significant changes in BMI-SDS throughout the course of the study. Subgroup analyses will be conducted by gender and age.</description>
