    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare HbA1c of insulin-treated subjects with type 2
      diabetes managed via usual care alone and usual care augmented with remote monitoring using
      Glooko
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator wants to evaluate if diabetes self-management supported by a
      mobile application, which captures a subject's blood glucose readings, lifestyle and
      medication information and shares it with the subject's certified diabetes educator (CDE) to
      enable remote monitoring, improves their glycemic control compared to standard of care.

    <description>Subjects in this arm will visit their physician once every 3 months and will receive usual care. In addition, in between clinic visits, subjects will measure their blood glucose (BG) readings at least once a day and share their BG readings with their CDE using Glooko's mobile application. Once a week, the CDE will review the subject's BG readings on Glooko's population tracker and reach out to the subjects if he/she experienced clinical incident(s). During the conversation, the CDE will either recommend medication or lifestyle modification to address the clinical incident.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an
             Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee, and provided Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or other privacy authorization prior to any
             participation in study.

          2. Subject has self-reported type 2 diabetes.

          3. Subject has HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 12.5% measured within 30 days of screening visit.

          4. Subject is on a stable diabetes therapeutic regimen of two or more diabetic
             medications (e.g., metformin plus one other antihyperglycemic agent) and/or insulin
             therapy for at least 2 months before screening visit. Dose changes or adjustments made
             within 2 months is acceptable as long as the patient has been on the medication
             regimen for 2 months or longer.

          5. Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age.

             prior to screening visit. A urine pregnancy test is required for all female subjects
             unless she is not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least
             one year prior to screening visit or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy).

          7. If female is of childbearing potential, is practicing one of the following methods of
             birth control (and will continue through the duration of the study):

               1. Condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or intrauterine device;

               2. Oral or parenteral contraceptives for 3 months prior to screening visit;

               3. Vasectomized partner;

          8. Subject is able to speak, read and write in English

             to Wi-Fi and downloaded at least one mobile application on their phone on their own.

         10. Subject has performed self-monitoring of blood glucose at least five (5) times within
             two (2) weeks prior to screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has type 1 diabetes.

          2. Subject has advanced disease (physical or psychological) that would prevent them from
             being able to comply with study tasks and considered exclusionary by the study
             physicians.

          3. Subject has been on medication or therapy within the last 2 months that severely
             affects blood glucose levels (e.g. corticosteroids).

          4. Subject has visual impairment which severely limits his/her ability to see or use the
             mobile application.
