  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-arm, non-randomised study to evaluate the Librata device performance
      and acute safety in performing global endometrial ablation in pre-menopausal women with heavy
      menstrual bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      4 clinical sits around the UK aim to recruit 40 women into a study to assess the primary
      objective of procedure success using the Librata endometrial ablation device, as defined as
      device success (completion of treatment cycles according to device specifications) and no
      occurrence of intra-procedural complications.

      The investigators will also assess the secondary objectives of:

        1. Rates of bleeding at months 3, 6 and 12 as measured by menstrual pictogram

        2. Rate of serious adverse device effects through to day 30 post-operatively

        3. Rates of re-intervention for menstrual related bleeding or pain and/or hysterectomy at 6
           and 12 months

        4. Rates of patient satisfaction at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Librata thermal balloon endometrial ablation treatment procedure will be performed in accordance with the physician's routine endometrial ablation practice and in accordance with the requirements of the LibrataTM IFU. The uterine cavity will be systematically inspected using hysteroscopy prior the ablative procedure (after any blind cervical dilatation) and post the ablative procedure to estimate the completeness of endometrial destruction and to exclude uterine trauma including uterine perforation. The patient will undergo standard post-operative monitoring and recovery according to usual hospital practices. An assessment will be made for any ablation procedure or device related serious adverse events.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory heavy menstrual bleeding with no definable organic cause

          2. Female subject from (and including) age 25 to 50 years

          3. Uterine sound measurement between 6.0 to 10.0cm (external os to fundus).

          4. A minimum menstrual blood loss of

               -  Menstrual Pictogram (MP) score of ≥150 for 3 consecutive months prior to study
                  enrollment; OR,

               -  MP score ≥150 for one month for women who either had:

                    -  at least 3 prior months documented failed medical therapy; or

                    -  a contraindication to medical therapy; or
