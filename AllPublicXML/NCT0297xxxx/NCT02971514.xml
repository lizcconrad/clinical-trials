      This randomized controlled crossover trial conducted on 25 dental students. in the
      preliminary session each volunteer was given a toothbrush(Trisa, soft, Switzerland) and
      toothpaste(Pooneh, Iran) and Dental Floss( Mina, Iran)to use during the study, and they were
      instructed the proper techniques of brushing and flossing.The study was performed in two
      treatment sessions and a 48 hour washout period. They passed through the sessions in a
      randomized sequence. After prophylaxis with rubber cup, they were asked to discontinue all
      oral hygiene for 24 hour. At the first session , they flossed first followed by brushing
      (floss-brush group) and at the other session they used dental floss after brushing
      (brush-floss group) . At each session, before and after brushing and flossing , Dental plaque
      reduction was assessed using Rustogi Modified Navi Plaque Index. Interdental plaque was
      collected for measuring fluoride. Differences between the two groups were analyzed with mixed
      model test.
