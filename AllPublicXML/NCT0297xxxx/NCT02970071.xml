      This is a diagnostic test in Shanghai Xinhua hospital from Nov.2016 to Dec.2017. 265 Cases
      are gravidas with fetal congenital heart disease diagnosed by echocardiography.Only gravidas
      who are willing to have complete pregnancy checks and finally delivery or abortion in the
      hospital are interviewed are eligible for the study. Study participants will be asked for
      their informed consent.We collect their fetal 2D echocardiography and STIC images every 4-6
      weeks during pregnancy and 1 weeks after the baby giving birth we finish their neonatal
      echocardiography.
