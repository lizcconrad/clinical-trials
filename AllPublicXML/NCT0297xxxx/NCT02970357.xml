  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The needs of children and teens with type 1 diabetes are very specific and different from the
      adults with type 1 diabetes. Many organizations such as the World Health Organization or the
      International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, recommend a patient therapeutic
      education when it comes to children with type 1 diabetes.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic education program on theoretical
      knowledge of the disease and also on quality of life, on biological and clinical indicators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Structuring a therapeutic education program for patients with a chronic disease was the
      initiative of the French High Health Authority in June 2007.

      The Prevention and Care of Pediatric Obesity and Pediatric Diabetes Organization of Mulhouse
      is a partner of the Mulhouse Hospital. Besides the usual care given at the hospital of
      Mulhouse for patients with a type 1 diabetes, both organizations also provide therapeutic
      education to these patients.

      Each therapeutic education program is organized according to the patient's age. They can also
      be organized in a group or individually.

      The aim of the therapeutic education is to help the young patients to cope with diabetes in
      their daily activities. Therapeutic education is known to bring good results for patients
      with diabetes, but there is no studies in France for children and teens with a type 1
      diabetes.

    <description>Every patient of the Mulhouse Hospital with a type 1 diabetes who joins the study will be followed for 10 months. They will fill in the DIAPASON questionnaire and the quality of life WHO-5 questionnaire on the day of enrollment and 10 months after enrollment, at the end of the study. Young patients followed for a type 1 diabetes at the Mulhouse Hospital usually come every two months to see the pediatric endocrinologist, so the data collected for a regular visit will also be collected for the study every two months between the enrollment and the end of study participation.</description>
