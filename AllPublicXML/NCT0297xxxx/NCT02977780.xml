      This research study is studying several investigational drugs as a possible treatment for
      Glioblastoma (GBM).

      The drugs involved in this study are :

        -  Abemaciclib

        -  Temozolomide (temodar)

        -  Neratinib

        -  CC115

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the study drug works in
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to compare the effects, good and bad,
      of the standard of care with the three investigational agent sub-studies Abemaciclib,
      Neratinib, CC115 to help people with Glioblastoma including the specific molecular changes in
      the genes and proteins.

      The FDA has approved Temozolomide (temodar) as a treatment for this disease, however the FDA
      has not approved Abemaciclib, CC115, Neratinib for any diseases.
