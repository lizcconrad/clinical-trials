    <textblock>
      Labor induction is one of the most common obstetric procedures performed in the U.S. In 2012,
      the last year for which data is available, 23.7% of all deliveries were the result of
      inductions. Labor induction first requires cervical ripening, which can be accomplished by
      several different methods. Vaginal or oral prostaglandins, extra amniotic saline infusion,
      osmotic dilators and transcervical Foley catheters are all widely used instruments for
      pre-induction cervical ripening. The ideal cervical ripening tool is safe for both mother and
      fetus, incurs low cost, does not require extensive monitoring, and causes minimal maternal
      discomfort. The Foley catheter has been found to be both safe and effective, but little is
      known about patient satisfaction with the device in an in-patient and out-patient setting.
      The proposed study will investigate patient satisfaction in a randomized controlled trial of
      in-patient versus out-patient use of Foley catheters.

      Labor induction is one of the most common obstetric procedures performed in the U.S. In 2013,
      the last year for which data is available, 23.1% of all deliveries were the result of
      inductions. Labor induction often first requires cervical ripening, which can be accomplished
      by several different methods.

      Pharmacologic cervical ripening approaches include vaginal or oral prostaglandin
      administration. Mechanical cervical ripening methods include osmotic dilators such as
      laminaria, and transcervical Foley catheters with or without extra amniotic saline infusion.
      The ideal cervical ripening tool is effective, safe for both mother and fetus, incurs low
      cost, does not require extensive monitoring, and causes minimal maternal discomfort.

      Several recent meta-analyses have demonstrated both the safety and efficacy of the Foley
      catheter for pre-induction cervical ripening. When compared to prostaglandins, studies have
      shown that use of the transcervical Foley catheter for pre-induction cervical ripening
      results in either shortened or no statistically significant difference in vaginal delivery
      rates at 24 hours. No studies have demonstrated longer duration to vaginal delivery and
      cesarean delivery rates are equivalent. In addition, women with Foley catheters experience
      less uterine hyper-stimulation resulting in fetal heart rate changes as compared to those who
      receive prostaglandins. Other than one study suggesting increased risks of chorioamnionitis
      and neonatal infection, the vast majority of research suggests Foley catheters are
      overwhelming safe with little risk of severe maternal or neonatal morbidity.

      Due to its safety profile and the ongoing desire to reduce healthcare costs, many
      institutions have initiated outpatient cervical ripening protocols. Studies suggest that
      outpatient cervical ripening with transcervical Foley catheter is both safe and effective. In
      addition, some studies demonstrate women who underwent outpatient cervical ripening spent
      less time in the hospital during their labor induction, sometimes resulting in significant
      cost savings at those institutions. The combination of safety, ease of use and cost savings
      potential make outpatient cervical ripening with a Foley catheter an appealing tool for both
      clinicians and patients. However, data on patient satisfaction with almost all methods of
      cervical ripening is sparse. Existing data on patient satisfaction of outpatient versus
      inpatient induction of labor stems from prior studies which used vaginal misoprostol gel or
      isosorbide mononitrate as induction agents. While one study suggests overall satisfaction
      with outpatient Foley catheter cervical ripening, a randomized controlled trial on this topic
      has yet to be performed.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the total score on Part A of the survey, giving an overall rating of the patients' experience with treatment. Means and standard deviations of the total score will be calculated and reported by treatment group among nulliparous and multiparous patients separately. To address the main hypothesis, an ANOVA (analysis-of-variance) will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis and the stratum (nulliparous vs multiparous) will be controlled for in the analysis. The mean difference between treatment groups will be calculated and reported with a 95% confidence interval for the population difference. A two-sample t-test will be used to test for a significant difference in overall rating between in-patient versus out-patient treatment groups.</description>

    <description>The experimental arm of the study will be subjects randomized to the outpatient group. Once randomized, subjects will complete a survey assessing their attitudes, fears, anxiety, satisfaction and expected hours of sleep with outpatient induction of labor. Following placement of the Foley catheter, the subjects will be given detailed instructions for which to return to the hospital, as well as provided a 24 hour phone number to call if they have questions. They will be instructed to return to the hospital once the catheter falls out or if 24 hours has passed since its placement. Upon returning to the hospital, subjects will complete another survey assessing their satisfaction with their induction process.</description>

    <description>Once randomized to this group, subjects will complete a survey assessing their attitudes, fears, anxiety, satisfaction and expected hours of sleep with inpatient induction of labor. Following placement of the Foley catheter, the subjects will undergo normal labor monitoring until their Foley catheter either falls out or is removed at 24 hours. At this time subjects will complete another survey assessing their satisfaction with their induction process.</description>

The NST will be read by a physician-member of the research team. If the NST is considered to be suspicious based on the physician's evaluation, subjects randomized to the outpatient arm will be moved to the inpatient arm, but evaluated as part of the outpatient arm on an intent-to-treat basis. All subjects randomized to the inpatient arm will be placed on continuous fetal heart rate monitoring, regardless of physician evaluation of the NST.</description>
