  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D(Vit D) is a pro-differentiation agent that enhances the accumulation of
      protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) after MAL(methyl-aminolevulinate) incubation in actinic keratosis
      and may have significant benefit for the treatment of actinic keratosis by ablative
      fractional laser-primed photodynamic therapy (AFL-PDT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL) is effective in the treatment of
      actinic keratosis (AK). Many strategies have been studied to improve the production of
      protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), to improve efficacy of PDT. Pre-treatment of the skin with
      fractional laser resurfacing is a novel alternative technique to improve the efficacy of PDT
      for AK. The investigators' previous studies showed that ablative fractional laser primed PDT
      (AFL-PDT) offered higher efficacy than conventional MAL-PDT in the treatment of AK. But,
      reduced response rates are also observed in thicker skin lesions, which may be due to
      insufficient PpIX accumulation within the target tissue.

      Cellular differentiation leads to increased synthesis of PpIX from MAL and consecutively,
      differentiation therapy enhances photosensitization effect. Topical calcipotriol is a
      well-known pro-differentiation hormone and was demonstrated to influence the effect of PDT on
      keratinocytes.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of topical vitamin D in AFL-PDT for AK
      treatment. Consequently, the investigator compared efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic
      outcome and safety between VitD - AFL-PDT and conventional AFL-PDT.

    <description>Adverse events reported by the patient were noted at each follow-up visit, including severity, duration and need for additional therapy. All events due to PDT were described as phototoxic reactions (i.e., erythema, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, oedema, itching, oozing, bleeding and so forth).</description>

    <description>After 3 hours of application with MAL, Fluorescence imaging analysis was performed on treatment area with ultraviolet examination light (model 31602,356 nm; Burton Medical Products Crop.) at 10 cm height above the base of each lesion. The red fluorescence was separated and extracted by ImageJ program and then used to measure the amount of 633 nm fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX.</description>
