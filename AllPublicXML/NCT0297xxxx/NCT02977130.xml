    <textblock>
      The American Diabetes Association indicates that diabetes self-management is a skill that
      diabetic patients must learn in the Diabetes Self-Management Education; thus, this
      contributes to shared care for diabetes, in which teams of physicians, professional nurses,
      and dietitians offer shared care to patients. However, according to the statistical analysis
      of the conditions of glycemic control in diabetic patients in 28 countries across 4
      continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America), the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of
      the 12,727 patients was 9.5% by Litwak et al. in 2013. In Taiwan, a national survey among
      diabetic patients in a shared-care program found that the percentage of patients with HbA1c
      lower than 7% increased by 6.5% from 2006 to 2011; yet, among the 720 patients who completed
      both surveys in 2006 and 2011, the percentage with HbA1c lower than 7% decreased by 2.1%
      during that period. These results suggest that despite the increase in the proportion of
      patients who successfully managed their diabetes, some patients still encountered difficulty
      in glycemic control.Therefore, numerous health education tools on diabetes continue to be
      developed. In 2011,JoAnn et al. determined that the mode of health care had a substantial
      influence on the dietary habits of diabetic patients, and that individual health education
      had the largest effect on diabetes control. In addition, using the conversation map for
      diabetes control also had a substantial influence on improving health behaviors. Among
      existing studies that have adopted the conversation map, no large-scale research has been
      conducted, the research samples and relevant studies in Taiwan have been scant, and no
      theoretical foundation has been applied in evaluating the effects of the conversation map.
      Accordingly, the investigators aimed to enhance the mutual experience exchange and learning
      among diabetic patients through adopting the conversation map to observe its influence on
      their health behaviors by incorporating it into existing health education modalities.
      Furthermore, on the basis of the Health Belief Model, a relevant questionnaire was designed
      for assessing the effectiveness of glycemic control in diabetic patients.
