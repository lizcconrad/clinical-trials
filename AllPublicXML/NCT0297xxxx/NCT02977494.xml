  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma patients with renal impairment need a rapid and effective reduction of tumor burden
      to enable renal recovery, which is correlated with prognosis of the patients. However,
      effective combination regimens are often hampered by necessary dose reductions or increased
      toxicity in renally impaired patients. The well known positive effects on renal impairment by
      Bortezomib combined with Daratumumab, which, as all monoclonal Antibody, is not renally
      excreted or metabolized and as so far known should not add significant toxicity but efficacy,
      makes the proposed combination of Daratumumab, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone highly attractive
      for renally impaired MM patients.

      In the current clinical trials with Daratumumab patients with renal function impairment (GFR
      ≤ 20 ml/min) were so far excluded. Consequently questions about efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Daratumumab in combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients
      with relapsed and refractory MM and severe renal impairment are still unanswered. This trial
      will answer these questions for a patient group, who has still an unmet need for novel and
      effective treatment options

             respectively), or hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody positive or HCV RNA quantitation
             positive).

         16. Subject has had major surgery within 2 weeks before treatment und has not fully
             recovered from surgery, or has surgery panned during the time the subject is expected
             to participate in the study.

         17. Incidence of gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of
             oral drugs

         18. Subject has any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease (eg. active
             systemic infection, uncontrolled diabetes, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary
             disease) that is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results, or that in
             the opinion of the investigator, would constitute a hazard for the participating in
             this study.

         19. Subject has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to corticosteroids,
             monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, or their excipients (refer to respective
             package inserts or Investigator's Brochure), or known sensitivity to mammalian-derived
             products.

         20. Subject is known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (eg.
             because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder). Subject has any
             condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in
             the best interest of the subject (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could
             prevent, limit or confound the protocol-specified assessments. Subject is taking any
             prohibited medication
