  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron sucrose infusion is an iron replacement used to treat iron deficiency anemia (not enough
      iron in the body to make hemoglobin). Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce
      hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. When the body does not get enough iron, it
      cannot produce enough hemoglobin and you become anemic.

      The research study is looking at the side effects of using a higher dose and faster rate of
      iron sucrose infusion than what is used in standard of care. The purpose of this study is to
      see if infusion with 500 mg of iron sucrose over a one hour time period can be done safely.
      If this can be done safely, it may reduce the total number of infusions required and the time
      for each infusion. This may be less costly and less burdensome to patients.
