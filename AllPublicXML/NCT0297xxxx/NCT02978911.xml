      Introduction: The skull base tumors surgery remains a challenge since numerous cranial nerves
      or vessels closely surround them. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging has developed with the
      tractography following white fibers and visualizing functional tracts. Cranial nerves
      tractography could allow predicting their displacement by skull base tumors that may help the
      surgeon to spare them along the surgery.

      Methods: Preoperative cerebral MRI was performed on patients who presented with skull base
      tumors. A 3 tesla MRI machine was used to acquire DTI sequence with specific parameters: 32
      directions, slice thickness 2 mm, echo time 86 ms, repetition time 12000 ms, matrix 128x128,
      b-value 1000 s.mm-1. An anatomic sequence hyperT2 was overlaid as reference. Distortion was
      corrected by topup and eddy functions from FSL. Cranial nerves fibers were probabilistically
      tracked with Mrtrix3. Cranial nerves were selected according to their location around the
      tumor. The &quot;radiological&quot; expected position of the cranial nerve was compared to its
      &quot;operative&quot; real position.
