  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gluteus medius tendinopathy, which is often referred to as Greater Trochanteric Pain
      Syndrome, is characterized by pain in the lateral aspect of the hip that is aggravated by
      side lying, stair climbing, and walking. Treatment is currently limited to lifestyle
      modifications, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and open and endoscopic surgical
      repair. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections contain important growth factors that are
      essential in the healing and tissue formation processes. However, the extent to which PRP is
      more efficacious than whole blood in tendinopathy remains unclear. In this double-blind
      randomized trial, patients will be allocated to receive either a PRP or whole-blood
      injection. Post-procedure assessments will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
      and 1 year.
