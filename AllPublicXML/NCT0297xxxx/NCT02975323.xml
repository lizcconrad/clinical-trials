  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension is the result of an increased hepatic vascular resistance and portal
      inflow. The best established method to assess portal pressures is the determination of wedged
      hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Ultrasound Doppler technique is non-invasive in the
      assessment of portal hypertension as compared with invasive technique of measurement of the
      hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Hemodynamic measurements (BP and pulse recording)
      will be done and then patient will be given tablet Carvedilol 12.5 mg in a single dose and
      wait till the time that 20% reduction in heart rate from the baseline occurs. Haemodynamic
      measurements will be repeated to assess the acute response to beta-adrenoreceptor blocker
      agent. The change in the HWF will be recorded post beta-adrenoreceptor blocker
      administration.

      Ultrasound Doppler technique is non-invasive in the assessment of portal hypertension as
      compared with invasive technique of measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient
      (HVPG). The Doppler waveform of the hepatic vein in healthy subjects is normally triphasic
      (two negative waves and one positive wave) because of central venous pressure variations due
      to the cardiac cycle. The normal triphasic hepatic vein waveform is transformed into a
      biphasic or monophasic waveform in patients with cirrhosis. A monophasic waveform has been
      shown to correlate with a high Child-Pugh score and a poor survival rate.

      Therefore, Hepatic vein waveform (HVWF) evaluation with Doppler US may be used as a
      supplemental tool to assess the severity of Portal Hypertension and therapeutic response to
      portal pressure lowering drugs in primary prophylaxis of variceal bleed in patients with
      large oesophageal varices. There's one study which has looked into the same topic but it has
      been conducted on alcoholic cirrhotics.

      Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive tool in the measurement of portal pressure in portal
      hypertensive patients. Hemodynamic measurements (BP and pulse recording) will be done and
      then patient will be given tablet Carvedilol 12.5 mg in a single dose and wait till the time
      that 20% reduction in heart rate from the baseline occurs. Haemodynamic measurements will be
      repeated to assess the acute response to beta-adrenoreceptor blocker agent. The change in the
      HWF will be recorded post beta-adrenoreceptor blocker administration. This study will be a
      validation and interventional study. It is an open labeled study.
