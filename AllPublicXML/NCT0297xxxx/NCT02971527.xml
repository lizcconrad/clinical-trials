  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether ultrasound bone strength device (Model
      Number: Oste-scan 500A) is effective and safe in measuring calcaneal bone strength index of
      human subjects, compared with a listed, similar device (Model Number: SONOST3000).

      This study adopt a method of multicenter, open-labeled, self-paired design. Each subject will
      be randomly assigned to two different detective sequence groups. In one group, the
      investigators will detect the same calcaneus of each subject by experimental ultrasound bone
      strength device firstly and then by control device. In another group, the investigators will
      detect the same calcaneus of each subject by control ultrasound bone strength device firstly
      and then by experimental device. Experimental ultrasound bone strength device is developed by
      Wuxi Huajian Hengchuang Medical Equipment Science and Technology Co., Ltd.. This device's
      model number is Oste-scan 500A and report number is Z-Y-2009-2014, Z-E-0530-2014(G). Control
      ultrasound bone strength device which has same clinical indications and action mechanism with
      the experimental one, is manufactured by Osteosys Co., Ltd.. This device's model number is
      SONOST3000.
