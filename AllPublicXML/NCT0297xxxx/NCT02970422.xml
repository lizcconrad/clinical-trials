    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to distribute a questionnaire created for individuals living
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to assess their activities, participation,
      and healthcare and COPD-related research priorities. The data collected will be compared
      across diagnosed COPD stages and disease severity to determine the extent to which adults
      with COPD participate in the listed activities and identify their primary research and
      healthcare related priorities. The questionnaire was originally developed based on past
      research then verified by a panel of COPD and participation experts; as well as, individuals
      living with COPD in the form of focus groups. The questionnaire will now be administered to
      200 individuals living COPD (50 in each GOLD stage) at three sites across Montreal where
      clinical data for each participant will be available. This phase will help establish the
      reliability of the questionnaire.

    <description>Participants will be asked to distribute a percentage of time they would spend talking to their healthcare provider in the next year about various predefined healthcare topics. They can distribute percentages in increments of 10% for a total of 100%. The larger the percentage of time they allocate to a particular healthcare topic, the more important it is for them.</description>
