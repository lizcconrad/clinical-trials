      In this single-center, open-label, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20
      resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients will be
      enrolled. CD19 CAR T cells will be administered by i.v. injection as a using a &quot;split dose&quot;
      (total dose of 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on
      day 2. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19
      CAR T cells in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.

      In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, a
      total of 20 resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients
      will be enrolled. Patients will be diagnosed according to morphologic, immunologic,
      cytogenetic and molecular(MICM) criteria, including bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype,
      cytogenetic and molecular examination. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector
      to express anti-CD19 scFv TCRζ:4-1BB,administered by i.v. injection as a using a &quot;split dose&quot;
      (total dose of 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on
      day 2. This protocol will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there are
      no effective therapies known at this time. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be
      monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 to 70 years with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive ALL(ie, ≥20%
             blasts CD19-positive) due to receive either salvage 1 or salvage 2 therapy. Ph+ ALL
             patients must have failed treatment with at least 1 second generation tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor.

          -  Bone marrow involvement with≥20% lymphoblasts.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2.

             transaminase(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or any serum creatinine level
             associated with a measured or calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 40ml/min.

          -  Patients who are: (a) pregnant, (b) breast feeding, (c) of childbearing potential
             without a negative pregnancy test prior to baseline and (d) male or female of
             childbearing potential unwilling to use contraceptive precautions throughout the trial
             (post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of
             non-childbearing potential).
