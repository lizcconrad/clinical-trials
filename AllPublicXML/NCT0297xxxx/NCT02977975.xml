  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects
      around 11% of the population globally. Several factors have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of IBS, including psychological stress, gastrointestinal motility, and diet .
      More recently, it has become clear that the gastrointestinal microbiota may play a critical
      role in the pathophysiology of this functional GI condition.

      Several studies have shown that an altered gut microbiota profile is present in at least some
      subgroups of IBS patients. This may, in part, explain why a proportion of IBS patients have
      elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in systemic circulation.

      Gut microbiome manipulation, for example through the use of probiotic and prebiotic
      supplements, has shown some promise in the treatment of IBS. However, the research in this
      area is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear what type of intervention that is the
      preferred choice in cases of IBS.

      Several studies have investigated how the use of probiotic supplements containing
      Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli affect the clinical outcome of patients with IBS. However, to
      date, no studies have assessed whether fermented vegetables, a &quot;natural&quot; source of probiotic
      bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, are useful in the treatment of IBS.

    <description>Sauerkraut fermentations have been shown to contain a broad range of microorganisms, including Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc argentinum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Lactobacillus coryniformis. Some of these bacteria, such as Lactobacillus plantarum, are classified as probiotics.</description>
