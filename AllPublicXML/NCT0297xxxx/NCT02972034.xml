  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of MK-8353 when
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). There are two parts in this study:
      Part 1 will be dose escalation and confirmation, and Part 2 will be a cohort expansion. In
      Part 1, the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MK-8353 in combination with a fixed dose of
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced malignancies will be identified and confirmed.
      Participants will be initially enrolled to receive MK-8353 at 350 mg twice a day (BID) in
      combination with pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle (Q3W)
      for up to 24 months of treatment. In Part 2, participants with advanced colorectal cancer
      (CRC) who received at least one and up to five prior lines of therapy will be enrolled at the
      RP2D in the expansion cohort to further evaluate safety and efficacy.

      The protocol has been amended to lower the starting doses of MK-8353 in combination with
      pembrolizumab. In addition, 3 arms have been added: one in which MK-8353 will be administered
      continuously once a day (QD) in combination with pembrolizumab, one optional arm in which
      MK-8353 will be administered 1 week on/1 week off QD in combination with pembrolizumab and
      one optional arm in which participants undergo a MK-8353 QD run-in period prior to starting
      combination therapy with pembrolizumab.
