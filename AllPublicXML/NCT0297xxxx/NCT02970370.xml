      The primary study aim is to depict the demographics, clinical and para clinical features of
      patients attending five tertiary referral multiple sclerosis (MS) centers in Egypt.

      This requires effective and unified pooled registries to extract data from with a
      standardized, sufficient and high quality clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data,
      neurophysiological data and body fluids.

      Investigators want to shed light on the challenges that face both physicians and patients in
      the area of &quot;diagnosis and treatment&quot;
