    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that an Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV)
      performs better than a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in the management of
      Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema (CPE) within an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), has played a
      decisive role in the treatment of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) secondary to Cardiogenic
      Pulmonary Edema (CPE). The use of either CPAP or NIV has resulted in greater clinical
      improvements than the ones that have been previously obtained by using a standard medical
      therapy. Although there is a strong indication for NIV in hypercapnic patients, the situation
      whether NIV is superior to CPAP remains unclear, and hence, both have been recommended.

      NIV and CPAP have both been successfully used in patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) suffering from CPE. However, few trials have been published on the ICU scenario. In
      addition, Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) has been considered to be an exclusion criterion in
      several trials.

      At the time of the onset of CPE, either in the Emergency Department (ED) or in the ward, all
      participants received a standard medical therapy (oxygen through a Venturi mask, morphine,
      intravenous nitroglycerin if their systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg, together with loop
      diuretics), all at the discretion of the attending physician. In the absence of a clinical
      improvement [dyspnea, respiratory rate &gt;25rpm, transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation
      (SaO2) &lt;90%], the participant was admitted to the ICU and assigned to the NIV group or the
      CPAP group, regardless of the treatment that they had received in the ED. The participants
      that were admitted to the ICU at the onset of CPE were randomised without a trial of medical
      treatment. The assignment of each group was performed by opening a sealed envelope following
      a prior randomisation by using a computerised system.

      Statistical. A comparative analysis was conducted by using the Student's t-test or the
      Mann-Whitney test for a comparison of the quantitative variables for the parametric and
      non-parametric characteristics, respectively. For the qualitative variables, the
      investigators used the Chi-Square statistic or Fisher's exact test. A statistical
      significance was reached if P&lt;0.05. The cumulative probability of survival was compared by
      using a Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival and a Log-Rank Test to compare both of the
      groups.

    <description>For the NIV group, a BiPAP Vision was used, by setting the Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) at a level that was required to achieve a tidal volume of approximately 8-10 ml/kg. Also an Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) was set at a minimum of 5 cmH20 during the first hour, gradually increasing until there was a clinical improvement. Fraction inspiratory of oxygen (FiO2) was applied to maintain a transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92%-94%. NIV was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time they were replaced by a Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.4.</description>

    <description>The CPAP was applied by using a flow generator with adjustable fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). This was connected to the Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve that was placed in the face mask. In the second instance, the CPAP system that was used was a Boussignac CPAP System Flow Jet. The Boussignac valve takes gas from a single source and splits it in order to create four high flow jets. These jets converge in the chamber creating a virtual valve. A initial level of 5cmH20 of PEEP was recommended for the first hour of ventilation, with subsequent increments (up to 15cmH20) until a clinical improvement was obtained. CPAP was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time it was replaced by a Venturi mask.</description>

            <description>For the NIV group, a BiPAP Vision was used, by setting the Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) at a level that was required to achieve a tidal volume of approximately 8–10 ml/kg. Also an Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) was set at a minimum of 5 cmH20 during the first hour, gradually increasing until there was a clinical improvement. Fraction inspiratory of oxygen (FiO2) was applied to maintain a transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92%–94%. NIV was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time they were replaced by a Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.4.

            <title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Group</title>
            <description>The CPAP was applied by using a flow generator that was capable of delivering a flow of 140 Liter /minute, with adjustable fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) that ranged from 0.3 to 1.0. This was connected to the Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve that was placed in the face mask. In the second instance, the CPAP system that was used was a Boussignac CPAP System Flow Jet. The Boussignac valve takes gas from a single source and splits it in order to create four high flow jets. These jets converge in the chamber creating a turbulence which creates a virtual valve. A minimal initial level of 5cmH20 of PEEP was recommended for the first hour of the CPAP, with subsequent increments (up to 15cmH20) until a clinical improvement was obtained. CPAP was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time they were replaced by a Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.4.

            <title>Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV Group)</title>
            <description>For the Non-Invasive ventilation group, a BiPAP Vision was used, by setting the Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) at a level that was required to achieve a tidal volume of approximately 8–10 ml/kg. Also an Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) was set at a minimum of 5 cmH20 during the first hour, gradually increasing until there was a clinical improvement. Fraction inspiratory of oxygen (FiO2) was applied to maintain a transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92%–94%. NIV was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time they were replaced by a Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.4.

            <title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Group</title>
            <description>The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure was applied by using a flow generator that was capable of delivering a flow of 140 Liter/minute, with adjustable fractional inspired oxygen that ranged from 0.3 to 1.0. This was connected to the Positive End-Expiratory Pressure valve that was placed in the face mask. In the second instance, the CPAP system that was used was a Boussignac CPAP System. The Boussignac valve takes gas from a single source and splits it in order to create four high flow jets. These jets converge in the chamber creating a turbulence which creates a virtual valve. A minimal initial level of 5cmH20 of PEEP was recommended for the first hour of the CPAP, with subsequent increments (up to 15cmH20) until a clinical improvement was obtained. CPAP was continuously applied until there was a clinical and/or a gasometrical improvement, at which time they were replaced by a Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.4.
