  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of an educational model, which includes
      cardiac rehabilitation with emphasis on physical activity and telephone reinforcement, with
      the usual management of individuals undergoing to intervention coronary percutaneous, in
      relation to physical activity six months after discharge.

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial (RCT) at a public teaching hospital, which has specialized care
      for CAD in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention group will receive
      usual care and an educational programme and the control group will receive only usual care.

      One of the researchers will perform the first interview (baseline). A researcher (who will
      not have contact with the patients) will generate the random allocation in Graphpad software,
      concealing it from the investigators in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. The
      same researcher who carried out the interview will open the envelope to allocate the
      participants to either intervention or control group.

      The educational programme consists of four booklets entitled 1. Percutaneous Transluminal
      Coronary Angioplasty, 2. Going home after your coronary angioplasty, 3. How to take care of
      your heart and your health, and 4. How to practice physical activities. The educational
      programme includes the telephone follow-up that consists in three calls to motivate the
      participants and clarify doubts. The booklets will be offered to the participants by a
      researcher (who will not participate in the interviews) face to face, who will explain the
      content step by step.

    <description>The &quot;Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity - BQHPA was developed by Baecke, Burema and Frijters (1982) and validated for the Brazilian population by Florindo et al. (2004, 2006). The instrument has three dimensions: occupational physical activity (eight questions), physical activity during leisure time (four questions) and leisure and locomotion activities (four questions), totaling 16 questions. This questionnaire will be used to collect the data at baseline and at six months.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&quot; was developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and validated and adapted to Portuguese by Botega et al. (1995). The HADS contains 14 multiple choice questions, divided into two subscales: anxiety and depression (composed of seven items each).This questionnaire will be used to collect the data at baseline and at six months.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Medical Outcomes Survey 36 - Item Short-Form&quot; developed by Ware and Sherboune (1992). The investigators will use the SF-36v2 version licensed by Quality Metric Incorporated (MARUISH, 2011) for use in surveys in Brazil. The SF-36 is a multidimensional questionnaire composed of 36 items that evaluate eight health concepts: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects, mental health and a comparative question that evaluate the current health conditions with one year ago. This questionnaire will be used to collect the data at baseline and at six months.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Escala de Autoeficácia Para Prática de Atividade Física&quot; developed by Rech et al. (2011) for Brazilian adults and by Borges et al. (2015) that used in the elderly population. This questionnaire was elaborated from two specific scales of self-efficacy for the practice of physical exercise, proposed by Sallis et al. (1988) and Bandura (2006). The investigators will use the Brazilian adult version (RECH et al., 2011) which contains two domains with five items each in which the answers are dichotomous ( &quot;no&quot; versus &quot;yes&quot;). Will be used to collect the data at baseline and at six months.</description>
