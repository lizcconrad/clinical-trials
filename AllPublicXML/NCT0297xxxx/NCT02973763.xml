  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alflutinib Mesylate Tablets is a Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor which can efficient suppress the EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation
      tumor cell in Xenograft mouse model. This study aims at local advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer patients with T790M drug-resistant mutation.
