    <textblock>
      We showed, for the first time, that Z-score increase during obesity was dependent on sex,
      severity of obesity and age but also on the bone site. Although the increase in BMD at
      bearing areas seems to be logically explained by the assumption that mechanical stresses have
      an osteogenic effect on bone tissue, BMD can in no way respond to the concomitant increase in
      BMD at non-load bearing areas such as the radius. These results suggest that changes in
      certain systemic compounds, induced by obesity, may interfere with bone metabolism. Moreover,
      the fact that the BMD or Z score is positively and only correlated with muscle mass and not
      with fat mass confirm that mechanical stresses are not the only factors acting on bone
      tissue.

      Our objectives are to determine the relationship between plasma concentration of myokines,
      adipokines, bone markers and BMD in obese subjects.

      Our objectives are to determine the relationship between plasma concentration of myokines
      (myostatin, follistatin), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin) and bone markers (CTX, Trap5,
      P1NP, ostéocalcin) in a cohort of obese patients, with differents obesity severity,
      differents ages.
