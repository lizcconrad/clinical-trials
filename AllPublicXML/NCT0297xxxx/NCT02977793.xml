      The Tomey EM-4000 Specular Microscope is designed to observe and analyze corneal endothelium
      by capturing an image of corneal endothelium tissues. without making contact, analyzing the
      captured image, and calculating data such as cell density.

          4. At least one eye with any of the following conditions:

               1. History of post-op surgical trauma including pseudophakic or aphakic bullous
                  keratopathy

        Exclusion Criteria - Pathologic adults (29-80 years old)

          1. History of cataract, refractive or ocular surgical procedures that render the cornea
             opaque or otherwise impact its ability to be imaged using the investigational device;

          2. Fixation problems which may prevent obtaining at least poor quality Tomey EM-4000 and
