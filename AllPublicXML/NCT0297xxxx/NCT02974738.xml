  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PT2977
      Tablets and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PT2977 Tablets in patients with
      advanced solid tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1A: This is a Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose-escalation trial of PT2977 Tablets, where
      patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to sequential dose cohorts. Patient
      safety will be monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording
      all adverse events (AEs). Blood will be obtained for analysis of the concentration of PT2977
      and to assess biomarkers.

      Part 1B: Once the MTD and/or the RP2D is achieved, and expansion cohort of 25 patients with
      advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) will be enrolled.

      Part 2: After determination of the MTD/RP2D, up to 25 patients with other specified solid
      tumors may be enrolled. Up to 3 different tumor types may be included in this part of the
      study.
