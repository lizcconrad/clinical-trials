  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing awareness that environmental factors, behaviors and diet are intimately
      related to patient health and may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of
      glaucoma. Evidence from recent years has shown that some behaviors and environmental factors
      can affect the intraocular pressure, the primary risk factor for glaucoma. This study aims to
      investigate whether simple and common lifestyle inteventions such as sleeping with a head
      elevation, a high fiber diet, moderate aerobic exercise and moderation in caffeine intake
      could affect intraocular pressure and other outcomes.
