  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a frequently performed test for the
      diagnosis and/or exclusion of coronary artery disease (CAD) in appropriately selected
      patients. The performance of non-contrast computed tomography for the detection and
      quantification of coronary calcification is typically performed prior to CCTA in an effort to
      identify significant calcification which may influence subsequent data acquisition during the
      CCTA. However, performance of calcium scoring adds significant radiation and most coronary
      calcification is proximal in its location, potentially visualized using a focused
      non-contrast scan.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the usefulness of a modified
      non-contrast CT, using a significantly shorter scan length and lower radiation parameters, as
      compared to standard coronary artery calcium scanning for the detection of coronary
      calcification that may influence subsequent CCTA performance.

    <description>In patients randomized to undergo the modified non-contrast CT scan to assess coronary calcification burden, this study will be performed by a radiologist and cardiologist as follows: axial acquisition obtained at 70% of the R-R interval using the following parameters: rotation time 0.35 sec; collimation of 64 x 0.625mm; detector coverage of 20.0 mm; axial thickness 2.5; tube voltage 80kV and tube current 250mA. The scan length will be from 1 cm below the carina to the level beneath the proximal coronary vessels defined as the greatest diameter of the apex of the right atrium.</description>
