      Background:Altered Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression levels and/or mutations in its
      signaling pathway (such as MyD88 mutation) contribute to the pathogenesis of
      lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD). CD180 is an orphan member of the TLR family that
      modulates the signaling of several TLRs, but only limited studies have evaluated its
      expression by flow cytometry (FCM) in LPD.

      Methods: Using a multiparameter FCM approach, biologists have assessed CD180 mean
      fluorescence intensity (MFI) in lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained
      from patients with follicular lymphoma (FL; LN/PB, n=44/n=15), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL, n=26/n=21), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n=13/n=17), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL,
      n=16/n=12). Specimens from non-tumoral PB and LN (n=8/n=12) were used as controls.

      Using a multiparameter FCM approach, biologists have assessed CD180 mean fluorescence
      intensity (MFI) in lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained from patients
      with follicular lymphoma (FL; LN/PB, n544/n515), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL,
      n526/n521), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n513/n517), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL,
      n516/n512). Specimens from non-tumoral PB and LN (n58/n512) were used as controls.

        99 LN (lymph nodes) and 65 PB (peripheral blood) samples obtained from patients diagnosed
        with LPDs in our institution between 2012 and 2014 were evaluated for CD180 expression by
        FCM. The diagnosis were made according to the WHO 2008 classification, including clinical
        and morphological analysis, immunophenotyping, and conventional and molecular cytogenetics
        (and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization). The diagnoses were follicular lymphoma (FL)
        (LN, n=44; PB, n=15), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL)/CLL
        (LN, n=26; PB, n=21), MCL (LN, n=13; PB,n=17), and MZL (LN, n=16; PB, n=12). All PB samples
        presented circulating neoplastic B-cells, and in several cases, the diagnosis was made at
        the same time in LN and PB FL, n=4; SLL/CLL, n=18; MCL, n=5. MZL, n=6.
