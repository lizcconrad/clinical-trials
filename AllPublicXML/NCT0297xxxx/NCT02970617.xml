    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well ringing a bell on the final day of radiation therapy
      works in improving the memory of distress in cancer patients. Ringing a bell on the final day
      of radiation therapy may improve the memory of how painful the treatment was.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the simple act of ringing a bell at the end of radiotherapy can improve
      the retrospective evaluation of distress due to radiotherapy and other prior cancer therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the severity of patients' memory of distress from cancer treatment.

      II. To assess the relationship between anxiety to actual distress and to remembered distress.

      III. To assess the relationship between optimism-pessimism personality to actual distress and
      to remembered distress.

      IV. To assess patient's cognitive dissonance reduction to actual distress and to remembered
      distress.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A (No bell ringing): Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy with or
      without chemotherapy.

      GROUP B (Bell ringing): On the final day of standard of care radiation therapy, patients ring
      a bell in the clinic.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 7 months.

    <description>Patient baseline characteristics and treatment will be summarized in groups A and B. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare distress memory scales between patients in group A and group B. A mixed regression model will be used to examine the effect of ringing the bell on the last day of radiotherapy on distress memory scales when considering covariates such as baseline patient characteristics, cancer type, radiotherapy total dose and duration, baseline distress scale, analgesic medication, disease recurrence status, optimism/pessimism personality and anxiety.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cancer

          -  Definitive radiation treatment with or without concurrent chemotherapy with curative
             intent; treatment prior to radiation therapy is acceptable (e.g. surgery,
             chemotherapy)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent; consents
             will be provided in English or Spanish

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with either a malignant central nervous system (CNS)-primary cancer or with
             brain metastases; patients do not need to undergo brain imaging unless indicated per
             standard workup and management (e.g. advanced stage lung cancer receiving definitive
             therapy)

          -  Patients who will be receiving surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy within 1 month
             following radiation treatment

          -  Patients with widespread metastatic disease (&gt; 3 distant metastases); patients with
             oligometastatic disease (=&lt; 3 distant metastases) are allowed only if they are
             receiving definitive (curative) radiation therapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy
