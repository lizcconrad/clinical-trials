  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a critical gap in knowledge of how intestinal bacterial communities alter
      metabolic substrates available to the host thereby influencing central and enteric nervous
      system (CNS/ENS) neurotransmitter levels involved in regulating carbohydrate consumption in
      humans. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing strategies to improve
      blood glucose control and to reduce the risk of transitioning from prediabetes to type-2
      diabetes (T2D). The investigators' long-term goal is to determine the biological
      underpinnings of behaviors that impact food intake and blood glucose control that contribute
      to the development of T2D. The objective of this proposal, which is an essential next step in
      attaining the investigators' long-term goals, is to determine how bacterial populations in
      the digestive system impact circulating tryptophan (TRP) and large neutral amino acid (LNAA)
      levels that regulate production of monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) in the ENS
      and in gastrointestinal system and the brain. The central hypothesis is that a reduced ratio
      of TRP producing (TRPp) to TRP consuming (TRPc) bacteria (decreased TRPp:TRPc ratio) in the
      gut will decrease TRP availability following a carbohydrate meal lowering the plasma TRP:LNAA
      ratio and resulting in less TRP for ENS/CNS production of 5HT. Further, dietary interventions
      that promote TRPp bacterial abundance within the gut will increase TRP availability to the
      host. The investigators will test the central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the overall
      objective for this project by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Assess impact of
      divergent microbiota on plasma TRP:LNAA ratio in response to acute carbohydrate consumption,
      and 2) Assess the impact of dietary supplementation with resistant starch (RS) on gut
      microbiota and circulating TRP:LNAA ratio. During Aim 1, stool samples will be collected from
      healthy participants. Participants will be stratified based on gut TRPp:TRPc ratio and the
      response to an acute meal will be assessed by determining plasma TRP:LNAA ratios. During Aim
      2 the capacity for 4-weeks of pre-biotic RS (Potato Starch) supplementation to increase the
      TRPp:TRPc bacterial ratio in the gut will be determined from stool samples. Additionally,
      plasma TRP:LNAA ratio following acute carbohydrate consumption before and after
      supplementation will be determined. The scientific contribution will be to determine the
      impact of RS on TRPp and TRPc bacteria abundance in the gut, and how bacterial populations
      impact circulating TRP:LNAA levels, that can impact ENS and CNS 5HT production in humans.
      This contribution will be significant because it will have direct translational implications
      for human diseases with altered 5HT signaling.
