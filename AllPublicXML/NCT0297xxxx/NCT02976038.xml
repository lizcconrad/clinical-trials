  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 Open-Label extension study to evaluate the long term safety and
      tolerability of daily elamipretide injections in patients with genetically confirmed Primary
      Mitochondrial Disease who previously participated in the SPIMM-202 Clinical Trial
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-comparative, extension trial will enroll subjects with genetically
      confirmed PMD who have completed the End-of-Study Visit in the SPIMM-202 trial. Subjects who
      do not discontinue or withdraw from the trial will receive treatment with 40 mg SC
      elamipretide for the shortest of the following: 260 weeks; regulatory approval and commercial
      availability of elamipretide in the subject's respective country; or termination of the
      clinical development for elamipretide in subjects with PMD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigator determines the subject can, and subject agrees to, adhere to the trial
             requirements for the length of the trial including self-administration (by subject or
             trained caregiver) of the study drug

          -  Subject completed the End-of-Study Visit in SPIMM-202

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing
             all trial requirements

          -  Subject has received any investigational compound (excluding elamipretide) and/or has
             participated in another interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to the
             SPIMM-203 Baseline Visit (excluding SPIMM-202) or is concurrently enrolled in any
             non-interventional research of any type judged to be scientifically or medically
             incompatible with the trial as deemed by the Investigator in consultation with the
             Sponsor

          -  Subject experienced an adverse reaction attributed to study drug resulting in
             permanent discontinuation of study drug in the SPIMM-202 trial.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating

          -  Subject has undergone an in-patient hospitalization within the 1 month prior to the
