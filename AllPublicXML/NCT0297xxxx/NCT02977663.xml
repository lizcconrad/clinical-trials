  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To build an imaging biobank of 200 patients with lungcancer, including pathologic and
           molecular characteristics of the tumor (mutational status, circulating DeoxyriboNucleic
           Acid (DNA) from serum biobank…), staging of the cancer (according to the new 2016 Tumor
           Node Metastasis (TNM) status, the table that classify non-small cell lungcancer) and
           follow-up informations (Response to first-line treatment (Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST)), disease-free survival, 1-3 years survival).

        2. To propose a simple severity scoring system based on tumor features such as size,
           doubling time (if available), location, amount of enhancement and necrosis. Such
           approach has been proposed for glioma evaluation (Visually Accessible Rembrandt Images
           (VASARI)) but is not available for the lung. The objective is to do better than the
           Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging.

        3. To develop and evaluate an IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) protocol for lungcancer
           evaluation.
