  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To validate the following theory: &quot;With TRUVIEW ART™ applied a detector's quantitative
      performance index, MTF(Modulation Transfer Function), is increased 20% or more&quot;. This is to
      examine the effect of the increased MTF index, whether it influences or not the interpreter's
      preference

      Background of Study :

      DRTECH Corp. has developed and applied for patenting the unique technology of TRUVIEW ART™.
      TRUVIEW ART™ is advanced image reconstruction technology that restores image quality from the
      side effects of scattering signals in indirect type scintillator detectors. It is an advanced
      image pre-processing technology that constructs signal scattering models (PSF) of indirect
      type detector scintillators. Image sharpness (MTF) is improved by predicting scattering
      models and eliminating the scattering signal.

      Purpose of Research and Assumption :

      Indirect conversion type detectors using scintillators are universal in today's diagnostic
      imaging area. However, they have a disadvantage of signal scattering compared with direct
      conversion type detectors. TRUVIEW ART™(Advanced Reconstruction Technology) can restore
      images from the scattering problems. The purpose of this study is to verify how well it
      improves the usefulness in clinical diagnostic imaging. Evaluation will measure the
      improvements in MTF, which is the quantitative performance index of a detector.
