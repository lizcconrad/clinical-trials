  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce
      exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing
      facilities (SNFs). The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as
      defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical
      criteria and patient preferences. The investigators will evaluate the effects of the
      intervention on the total number of medications prescribed to patients at hospital and SNF
      discharge and at home 90-days after SNF discharge along with the prevalence of eight
      geriatric syndromes, medication adherence, and health status.

      This randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce
      exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing
      facilities (SNFs). This study will be conducted in one university-affiliated hospital and 14
      area SNFs to enroll approximately 1,300 total participants across five project years.
      Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare beneficiaries discharged
      to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of independence
      and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, which provides strong preliminary data
      related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and
      geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population.
      Based on these data, the investigators developed a structured deprescribing intervention
      protocol (&quot;Shed-Meds&quot;) coupled with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric
      syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and continued during the SNF stay. The goal of
      the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and
      stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences.
      This trial will evaluate the effects of this intervention on medication exposure, medication
      adherence, geriatric syndromes, and health status across the care transitions from hospital
      to SNF to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after SNF discharge. The overarching
      hypothesis is that reducing medications for older patients across the continuum of care will
      favorably impact geriatric syndromes.

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive a clinical review of their prescribed medications by a research clinician (Pharmacist, Physician, and/or Nurse Practitioner) followed by a patient interview to assess their willingness to discontinue or reduce some of their medicines based on the clinical recommendations of the team. Hospital and out-patient providers also will be part of the deprescribing decision process. Deprescribing actions will be initiated in the hospital prior to discharge and continue through the skilled nursing facility stay.</description>
