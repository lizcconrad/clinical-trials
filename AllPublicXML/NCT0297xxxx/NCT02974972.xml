  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators conducted research among HIV-infected and -uninfected
      pregnant and lactating women to understand the potential role and importance of food
      insecurity on participant physical and psychosocial health and nutrition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study was that food and nutrition insecurity are detrimental
      to the health of HIV+ pregnant women and their infants via nutritional, disease, and
      psychosocial pathways.

      In the first phase, the investigators collected descriptive data to describe and assess food
      and nutrition insecurity and the associated modifiable determinants among HIV+ pregnant and
      lactating women in Kenya.

      In the second phase, the investigators collected longitudinal cohort data from women who were
      recruited during pregnancy and have been followed throughout the infant's first year of life.

        A cohort of 371 pregnant HIV-infected and -uninfected women (ratio 1:1) were recruited from
        7 rural and urban clinics in Nyanza, Kenya. Participants were followed from ≤30 weeks
        pregnancy until 9 months postpartum.
