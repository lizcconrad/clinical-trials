    <textblock>
      There has been only minimal research on wheelchair skills by the caregivers of manual or
      powered wheelchair. There are no published data on the extent to which caregivers can enhance
      the mobility of powered wheelchair users. The primary objective of this study is to test the
      hypothesis that caregivers enhance the wheelchair skills capacity, confidence and performance
      of the powered wheelchair users to whom they provide assistance. Our secondary objective is
      to add to the literature on the measurement properties of the wheelchair skills test
      (questionnaire and capability version) for powered wheelchair users and their caregivers.
