  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the best way to increase screening for
      cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, HIV, and Hepatitis C among underscreened Hispanic,
      Haitian and African-American individuals in Hialeah, South Dade, and Little Haiti. The
      investigator will compare home testing led by a community health worker (CHW) versus clinic
      testing guided by a CHW. Community Health Workers are people who have undergone several weeks
      of community outreach and health education training. During the study period the participant
      will continue to receive all of their regular medical care from their regular health care
      providers. If the participant does not have a health care provider, the Community Health
      Workers would be able to help in referring the participant for care at a local health care
      clinic located in their community.
