      The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate and validate the clinical performance of the Scanadu Urine Device in the hands
           of intended users as compared to: the visual read of chemical test strips performed by
           lab technicians utilizing the Siemens Multistix® 10SG technology (K905396).

        -  Evaluate and validate the user-interface of the Scanadu Urine Device by the intended
           users for human factors and user interface of the Scanadu Urine Device.

        -  Evaluate the reproducibility in the hands of the lay-users after repeated testing of
           samples with known test levels
