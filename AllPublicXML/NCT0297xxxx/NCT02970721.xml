      The objectives of the proposed project are:

        1. To describe the patterns of mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, antidepressant, and
           anxiolytic prescriptions during pregnancy over a period of 12 years (2002-2014) in women
           aged 13 to 50 years who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in Ontario.

        2. To identify the factors associated with use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and
           antipsychotic-antidepressant polytherapy in pregnant women diagnosed with bipolar
           disorder.

        3. To assess the impact of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and
           antipsychotic-antidepressant polytherapy on the risk of maternal, neonatal, and labour
           and delivery outcomes in women with bipolar disorder.

        4. To assess the impact of antipsychotics, antidepressants, antipsychotic-antidepressant
           polytherapy on psychiatric readmission rates during the early postpartum period in women
           with bipolar disorder.

        Women between the ages of 13 and 50 years who were hospitalized for a singleton obstetrical
        delivery between 2002-2014. Additionally, these women must be covered under the provincial
        drug benefit plan during index pregnancy, which is defined as having filled a drug
        prescription in the period from six months prior to pregnancy to six months after delivery.
        For women who had multiple pregnancies over the study period, we will select their first
        pregnancy as the index pregnancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women were included in our study cohort if they met at least one of the following criteria:
        (i) an inpatient hospitalization with a primary discharge diagnosis of BD prior to the
        index pregnancy; (ii) an outpatient OHIP fee code for a mood disorder plus a prescription
        of a mood stabilizer prior to the index pregnancy (note that the outpatient OHIP fee code
        (296) without a prescription would not have been sufficient to identify BD patients because
        the fee code is used concurrently used for diagnosis of unipolar depression). Additionally,
        women were included in the study cohort if they were continuously covered for ODB
        throughout their pregnancy, defined as having filled any provincially funded drug
        prescription within six months prior to conception and another either during their
        pregnancy or within six months after delivery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (1) women with gestational weeks less than 20 and more than 45 at delivery; (2) pregnancies
        with multiple overlapping records over the study time period; (3) any data with
        inconsistencies and duplicate records for pregnancy; (4) any woman sharing the newborn's
        IKN, given that we would be unable to differentiate between the two persons; (5)
        observations with missing birth date for the baby and the time period between the mother's
        admission and discharge date greater than 14 days (since we were unable to determine the
        conception date for these women; and (6) women who filled a treatment prescription up to 30
        days prior to pregnancy and none during the period of pregnancy.very
