      Background:

      Difficulties in social interactions are a central characteristic of people with
      schizophrenia, and can be partly explained by impairments of social cognitive processes.
      According to renown researchers, three to five social cognitive processes are usually altered
      in schizophrenia: (1) emotional processing; (2) theory of mind (ToM); (3) attributional
      style; and (4 and 5) social perception and knowledge. The components of social cognition
      appear to be related to both symptomatology and functioning in everyday life.

      New strategies of cognitive remediation have been recently developed to target these deficits
      and few meta analyses have assessed the extent to which social cognitive remediation programs
      have led to multiple improvements for schizophrenia patients. Overall, it seems that such
      therapies showed encouraging results in both patient interest and motivation, and social
      cognitive processes.

      The RC2S therapy is the first individualized and partly computerized program through which
      patients practice social interactions and develop social cognitive abilities with simulation
      techniques in a realistic environment.

      Methods:

      This is a randomized controlled trial to establish the validity of the RC2S+ program in
      schizophrenia.

      The project's main objective is to assess the impact of RC2S+ on social cognitive impairments
      in schizophrenia compared with a cognitive remediation program (control therapy) focusing on
      neurocognition, equivalent in terms of number, duration and rhythm of sessions.

      The study has four other objectives:

        1. To assess the influence of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on neurocognitive
           processes

        2. To assess the impact of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on social functioning

        3. To assess the impact of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on both positive and
           negative symptoms

        4. To study the maintenance of benefits 3 months forward

      Outcomes:

      To treat social cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia.
