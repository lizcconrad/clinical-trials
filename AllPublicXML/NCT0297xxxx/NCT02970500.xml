    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive Impairment, (CRCI) commonly referred to as &quot;chemo brain&quot; or &quot;brain
      fog&quot;—impact severely on the Quality of Life (QoL) of cancer survivors, It still remains
      underdiagnosed and challenging to treat. One of the treatment options is the use of
      psychostimulants such as Methylphenidate (MP), but well-designed clinical trials to test its
      efficacy are limited. We will conduct a phase II study with a mixed method design to explore
      the preliminary efficacy of MP to improve cognitive function and Quality of life in breast
      cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and determine the
      parameters needed for designing a phase III study. This study will include two phases: Phase
      one: randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, phase 2 open-label trial.

      Objectives: The main objective of this study is to determine the parameters for a Phase III
      study to measure the efficacy of methylphenidate (MP) in improving cognitive deficits in
      women with Breast cancer who had received chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. In addition,
      the profile of drug side effects will be estimated. A better understanding of Cancer-related
      cognitive impairment and its impact on the activities and quality of life of the study
      population will be targeted.

      Population: The sample will consist of 40 women in remission from non-metastatic breast
      cancer, with follow-up at the Department of Radio-Oncology, CHU de Québec-Université
      Laval-L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, who had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy, complaining of
      cognitive impairment, and without any medical condition or contraindications to MP that may
      interfere with the drug or the cognitive impairment status. Before study inclusion, the
      eligibility of these women will be validated by questionnaires and verification of their
      medical records.

      Recruitment: Recruitment will be made with the help of the radio-oncology team who will refer
      patients to the research team. As alternative recruitment method, we will use posters. flyers
      and advertisement. Finally, recruitment could be made through the clinical trial.gov website.

      Study design: A mixed methodology with a convergent design will be used in this pilot
      clinical trial.

      Procedures:

      The study quantitative component will use questionnaires and tests assessing cognitive
      function in order to estimate the effect size to be used in the design of a Phase III
      clinical trial and will be divided into two phases. The first phase corresponds to a
      double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial which will test the effect of MP on
      cognitive function. This phase begins at time T0, before any MP is taken, and ends 14 days
      after, T1. Participants will be assigned randomly to the intervention, where they will
      receive 10 mg of methylphenidate (Biphentin, slow released) for 14 days or control group
      where they will receive placebo.

      The second phase is an open-label study that will explore a higher dosage. In this phase, all
      participants will receive methylphenidate SR at an increasing dose starting at 10 mg for a
      week (1capsule). After evaluation, this dosage will be increased, if possible, to 20 mg per
      day (2 capsules).

      Depending on their response to the starting dose of MP, for the following 7 days, they will
      receive:

        -  no Methylphenidate (no capsule), if they have important side effect;

        -  Methylphenidate 10 mg (1 capsule) if they have sufficient improvement or do not want to
           increase the dosage

        -  Methylphenidate 20 mg (2 capsules) if they have partial or no improvement without
           important side-effects. This phase begins at the end of the first phase T1 and ends 14
           days after, T2.

      Measures: The calculation of the effect size will be based on the Auditory consonant trigrams
      which will be used to determine the power required for a Phase III study. This test will also
      be used to test the sensitivity of the Fast Cognitive Evaluation tool (FaCE) which is a new
      test developed and validated by our team.

      The global change in cognitive function will also be evaluated by the (FaCE). Other tests
      will be explored to assess their sensitivity in measuring cognitive changes.

      Here is the list of measures: Rotterdam Checklist Symptom, Unipedal Balance Test, Stroop
      test, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, Multidimensional
      fatigue inventory, Distress Thermometer.

      Analysis: Descriptive statistical analyses will be carried out. Using tests such as T-test,
      χ2 and ANOVA we will also estimate the degree of improvement in cognitive function by
      comparing data from the Placebo and the methylphenidate group.

      The qualitative component will explore, through a 1-hour individual interview with the 40
      women included in the study, their experience of cognitive deficits before and after MP /
      placebo, at T0 and T1. The analysis of these interviews will be carried out by combining two
      methods: an intra-case analysis and an inter-case analysis, in order to properly document the
      experience of these women and to arrive at an assessment of the transferability of the
      results.

      Each of the components of the study will answer its main questions independently. However,
      the data will also be matched (triangulation) to provide a global understanding of the issue
      and convergence of results where possible.
