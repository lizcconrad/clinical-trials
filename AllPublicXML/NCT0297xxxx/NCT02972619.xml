  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hypertension is a serious public health problem responsible for significant
      mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease. In Singapore, 1 in 4 adults age 30 years
      or older suffer from hypertension. Nearly half of these patients have uncontrolled
      hypertension and only 50% of individuals are on antihypertensive treatment. Our study aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and impact on medication adherence of a
      well-structured program using multicomponent intervention for hypertension control aimed at
      overall cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals with hypertension attending the
      polyclinics in Singapore, compared to existing services. Such a program is expected to be
      cost-effective in terms of improving hypertensive individuals' outcomes, and to be
      potentially scalable and sustainable.

      Methods/design: Cluster randomized trial of 8 of the nine SingHealth Polyclinics randomized
      to intervention or usual care (4 each) and followed up for 2 years post randomization

      Intervention: The structured multicomponent primary care program comprises of: 1)
      algorithm-driven antihypertensive treatment for all hypertensive individuals and using
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) and lipid-lowering medication for high-risk hypertensive
      individuals, 2) motivational conversation for high-risk hypertensive individuals, 3)
      Follow-up of all hypertensive individuals on improving blood pressure (BP) as a primary
      outcome and other cardiovascular risk factors as a secondary outcome, and 4) discounts on FDC
      antihypertensive medication

      Usual care: The participants attending polyclinics randomized to usual care will continue to
      receive treatment from the health providers according to existing practices. The hypertensive
      individuals will also continue to pay for the services (physician or nurse consultation) as
      per their existing model of reimbursement.

      Participants: A total of 1000 participants will be recruited, 125 from each of the 8
      polyclinics. Recruitment will be in batches of 4 and 4 clinics sequentially (balanced by
      randomization group).

      Outcomes: All hypertensive individuals will be assessed by trained outcomes assessors
      independent to treatment at baseline, 1-year and 2-yeat post randomization. The primary
      outcome will be the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 2 years. Primary
      Cost-Effectiveness measures will be- 1) Incremental cost per mm Hg systolic BP reduction from
      baseline to end of follow-up at two years post randomization; 2) incremental cost per
      projected CVD disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and quality adjusted life years
      (QALYs) saved, and 3) incremental cost per change in cardiovascular risk score from baseline
      to final follow-up at two-year post. The impact of effect on adherence to antihypertensive
      and lipid medication will be measured using data on adherence obtained from polyclinic
      pharmacy records and clinic notes. An average of percent adherence to antihypertensive and
      lipid lowering will be computed as a composite score. The change in percent composite
      adherence to antihypertensive and lipid medications from baseline to follow up will be
      compared between the intervention and control groups.
