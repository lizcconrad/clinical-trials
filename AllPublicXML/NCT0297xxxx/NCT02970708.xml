      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eyetronix Flicker Glassess therapy in treating
      anisometropic amblyopia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 176 children with anisometropic amblyopia, aged 4 to 13 years, will randomize to
      receive patching or Eyetronix Flicker Glasses treatment in a 1:1 ratio.Eyetronix Flicker
      Glasses, a lightweight spectacle frame with liquid crystal lenses that provide direct
      square-wave alternating occlusion, will be used at a pre-programmed temporal frequency.
      Patching is a traditional treatment of amblyopia. The best corrected visual acuity, contrast
      sensitivity, binocular function,visual evoked potential and functional MRI will be measured
      at baseline and follow-up visits to assess the improvement of amblyopia.Feedback information
      from the questionnaires will be used to evaluate the compliance and adverse effects.
