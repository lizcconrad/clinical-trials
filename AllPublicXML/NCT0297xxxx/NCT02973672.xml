  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and performance of SGM-101, a Carcinoembryonic Antigen
      (CEA)-specific chimeric antibody conjugated with a NIR emitting fluorochrome, for the
      visualization of CEA-expressing cancers during surgery. SGM-101 is injected 2 to 4 days
      before surgery and visualized using an optimized camera system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the most important therapy for patients with cancer of the colon, rectum or
      pancreas. Complete resection, which is a crucial factor in the prognosis of a patient, is
      challenging as surgeons have to rely on visual appearance and palpation to discriminate
      between tumor and normal tissue.

      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor-specific marker that is highly expressed in a
      number of tumors of epithelial origin (such as colorectal carcinoma and pancreas carcinoma)
      while it is minimally expressed in normal adult tissues. The compound that will be studied in
      this research project is SGM-101, a CEA-specific chimeric antibody conjugated with a
      near-infrared (NIR) emitting moiety. The hypothesis is that, following preoperative iv
      administration of SGM-101 in patients with carcinoma of the colon, rectum or pancreas,
      SGM-101 will bind to CEA expressing cancer cells and these cells can then be visualized with
      a NIR fluorescence imaging system, thereby increasing the chance of radical resection.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is participating in a clinical study performed. The adverse event does not necessarily have to follow the administration of a study drug, or to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory or vital sign finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study participation, whether or not it is related to the study drug.</description>
