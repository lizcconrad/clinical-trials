      The purpose of this study is the measurement of the evolution of the operation time during
      the start-up phase of robotic-assisted surgery for the treatment of inguinal hernia`s of 50
      patients treated in Maria Middelares in laparoscopic rTAPP technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive hernia repair by laparoscopy is the standard treatment in adult patients
      in Maria Middelares, Ghent. A previously conducted study demonstrated that the symptoms of
      patients with inguinal hernias (verified via EuraHS Quality of Life score) can be effectively
      treated and the technique has a low recurrence rate and low frequency of long-term side
      effects.

      Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has become standard in urology for resection of the
      prostate carcinoma. In general abdominal surgery, a large group of surgeons are currently
      working on the introduction of robotic-assisted surgery for resection of colon and rectal
      cancer in their daily practice. The third generation robot (DaVinci Xi), has extended the
      applicability of this technology within the field of general surgery.

      For the surgical treatment of hernia's and other abdominal wall defects (umbilical or/and
      incisional hernia's), currently only surgeons in the US have experiences in structured
      treatment programs.

      From September 1, 2016 Maria Middelares hospital will introduce robot-assisted surgery,
      including the laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair.

      Main obstacles to the introduction of robot technology in abdominal wall surgery are
      prolonged preparation time in the operating room required for installation of the robot, and
      higher material costs related to the robot-assisted surgery. However, there are few precise
      data available on the exact size of extra time or increased costs related to the introduction
      of robotic assisted surgery in a program for abdominal surgery.

      The purpose of this study is the measurement of the evolution of the operation time during
      the start-up phase of robotic-assisted surgery for the treatment of inguinal hernias by 50
      patients in Maria Middelares hospital.
