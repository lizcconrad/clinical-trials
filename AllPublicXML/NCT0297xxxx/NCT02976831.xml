  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, affecting 1-3% of the
      population in Europe and the United States of America (USA) and represents one of the most
      prevalent immune inflammatory diseases. AZD0284 is a potent selective inverse agonist of
      RORg, which is being developed for the management of psoriasis. The current Phase 1 study
      investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be conducted in
      healthy subjects. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with
      Part 1 being split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The results from this study
      will form the basis for decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify
      appropriate, well-tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients
      with psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. There are 2 key
      abnormalities in psoriasis, hyper proliferation of keratinocytes and an inflammatory cell
      infiltrate, which includes; dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) T cells,
      mast cells, T cells and neutrophils. There is strong evidence that T cells have an important
      role in psoriasis, including the fact that T-cell targeted agents are effective in psoriasis
      therapy. This study is the first time AZD0284 will be given to humans. The current Phase 1
      study investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be
      conducted in healthy subjects to avoid interference from disease processes or other drugs.
      The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with Part 1 being
      split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The secondary and safety pharmacology of
      AZD0284 has been investigated using both in vitro and in vivo models. Screening of AZD0284 in
      a diverse set of in vitro radiolig and binding, enzyme, functional and electrophysiological
      assays including cardiac ion channels did not identify any off-target activities likely to be
      relevant in or near the therapeutic exposure range. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      defined such that the selected subjects will be free of any significant illness when included
      in the study. The selected starting dose for the SAD part (Part 1A) of the study is 4.0 mg
      AZD0284 (oral solution). The maximum allowed exposure based on the toxicology studies is 127
      μmol*h/L (total AUC(0-24,ss)) or 7.35 μmol/L (total Cmax). In Part 1A (SAD study), 6 dose
      levels and in Part 2 (MAD study), 3 dose levels are planned. In either part, up to 2
      additional doses may be added if needed. The results from this study will form the basis for
      decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify appropriate, well-tolerated
      doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients with psoriasis.

             considered by the PI that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval
             changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined
             primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy. Prolonged QT interval corrected for

             dissociation.

             branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110 ms.
             Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of e.g.
             ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation

         11. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the PI

         12. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             3 months.

         13. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol, as judged by the PI.

         14. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or cotinine (nicotine) at screening or admission to
             the Unit or positive screen for alcohol on admission to the Unit prior to the first
             administration of IMP.

         15. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important
             allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the PI or history of hypersensitivity to drugs
             with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD0284.

         16. Excessive intake of caffeine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate),
             as judged by the PI.

         17. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
             prior to the first administration of IMP.

         18. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including antacids, analgesics
             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life.

         19. Plasma donation within one month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss &gt; 500
             mL during the 3 months prior to screening

         20. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of investigational
             product in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or
             one month after the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: subjects consented and
             screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not
             excluded.

         21. Receipt of live viral or live bacterial vaccines (such as BCG) 3 months prior to
             randomization on Day 1.

         22. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order

         23. Subjects who have previously received AZD0284

         24. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.

         25. Judgment by the PI that the subject should not participate in the study if they have
             any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints
             that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to
             comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

         26. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions.

         27. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the PI.

         28. Subject who have increased risk of infection

               -  History and/or presence of tuberculosis (TB); positive result for IFN-γ release
                  assay (IGRA) (i.e. QuantiFERON TB-Gold) the test may be repeated if the initial
                  test result is indeterminate. Subjects who have resided in regions where
                  tuberculosis or mycosis are endemic during 90 days before screening or who intend
                  to visit such a region during the duration of the study.

               -  Subjects with active malignancy or neoplastic disease in the previous 5 years
                  other than superficial basal cell carcinoma.

               -  Subjects who have received live or attenuated vaccine in the 4 weeks prior to
                  dosing.

               -  Subjects with a disease history suggesting abnormal immune function.

             In addition, the following is considered a criterion for the exclusion from the
             optional genetic component of the study:

         29. Previous bone marrow transplant.

         30. Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the
             genetic sample collection or previous bone marrow transplant.
