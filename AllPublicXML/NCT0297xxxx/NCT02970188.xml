  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of time-restricted feeding
      (eating within an 8-hour window) for improving physiological function (vascular, motor,
      cognitive and metabolic function) in healthy middle-aged and older adults.

      Overall, the proposed research project has the long-term potential to influence clinical
      practice by establishing novel therapies for treating multiple domains of age-associated
      physiological dysfunction and thereby reducing the risk of clinical disease and disability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

          -  Baseline brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) &lt; 6%Δ (rationale: non-invasive
             screening to ensure exclusion of subjects with exceptionally high baseline endothelial
             function.

          -  Ability to perform motor and cognitive tests (e.g., can rise from a chair, walk for 2
             min, climb 10 stairs)

          -  Women will be confirmed as postmenopausal (either natural or surgical) based on
             cessation of menses for &gt;1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages &lt;55 years or ≥80 years

          -  Occupation that requires night-shift work or abnormal hours that would disrupt eating
             schedule

          -  Dietary habit of regularly skipping meals, already eating within a ~10 hour window, or
             any other form of restrictive eating.

          -  Unable to adhere to an 8 hour eating window for the length of the study period

          -  Participation in regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise (&gt;3 vigorous bouts/week)

          -  Not weight stable in the prior 3 months (&gt;2 kg weight change).

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m^2 (rationale: vascular function measurements can be
             inaccurate in severely obese subjects)

          -  Current smoking

          -  Diagnosis of a chronic clinical disease (e.g., coronary artery/peripheral
             artery/cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis,
             neurological disorders or diseases that may affect motor/cognitive functions [multiple
             sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, polio, Alzheimer's disease, dementia or other brain
             diseases of aging]), except hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

          -  Having unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or aorto-
             coronary bypass surgery as defined by the occurrence of an event, symptom, surgery, or
             change in medication and/or dosage within 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Having thyroid disease that is not controlled by medications or &lt;3 month's use of a
             particular medication and/or dosage (rationale: uncontrolled thyroid diseases are
             associated with alterations in vascular function).

          -  Having past or present alcohol dependence or abuse, as defined by the American
             Psychiatry Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
