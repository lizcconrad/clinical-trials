  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use a cluster-randomized design to evaluate the overall impact of the
      Alive &amp; Thrive infant and young child feeding communication strategies in Lagos and Kaduna
      States, Nigeria. The impact in a subset of urban local government areas (LGAs) will also be
      tested.This is a mixed methods evaluation; the quantitative data will be complemented by
      qualitative data obtained from different groups targeted by or involved in the program.

    <textblock>
      Adequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days is necessary for children to grow and develop
      to their full potential. Alive &amp; Thrive (A&amp;T) contributes to better nutrition during the
      first 1,000 days by promoting improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. A&amp;T
      is expanding its efforts to Nigeria and will target Lagos and Kaduna States. In Nigeria, 33%
      of infants are breastfed within 1 hour of delivery, 60% are given other fluids in the first 3
      days of life, and only 17% of children 0-5.9 months are exclusively breastfed. Approximately
      60% of children 6 to 23 months achieve the minimum meal frequency for their age and 19% are
      fed four or more food groups per day. To address these gaps in optimal IYCF practices, A&amp;T
      will use an implementation framework for IYCF impact at scale that includes advocacy,
      interpersonal communication and community mobilization, mass communication, and strategic use
      of data. The A&amp;T intervention will be compared to mass media communication on IYCF, which
      will be provided throughout the two states. LGAs in Lagos and Kaduna will be randomly
      allocated such that two-thirds receive the A&amp;T intervention and one-third are assigned to the
      comparison group. The primary objective of the evaluation is to measure the impact of the A&amp;T
      intervention on IYCF practices among mothers with children 0-23 months of age overall and in
      a subset of urban LGAs. Secondary evaluation objectives are to document: the type, quantity,
      and timing of the implementation of A&amp;T program activities; coverage levels A&amp;T achieves with
      different program activities; extent to which A&amp;T increases knowledge and awareness of
      optimal IYCF practices among women with children 0 to 23 months and health providers; extent
      to which A&amp;T improves the capacity of health providers to counsel mothers on IYCF; and extent
      to which A&amp;T improves the capacity of stakeholders to implement community-based activities
      that support optimal IYCF practices.
