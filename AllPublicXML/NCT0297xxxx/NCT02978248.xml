      ARENA aims to inform patients about the symptoms and the risks of atrial fibrilation.

      The study design includes three study arms:

        1. ARENA Intervention: This project will examine the effectiveness of population education.

        2. ARENA Medication: The aim is to examine the patient's adherence and to analyze whether
           there are any complications.

        3. ARENA Migration: ARENA migration aims to examine whether a targeted population education
           can improve the care of people with a Turkish migration background.

      ARENA aims to inform patients about the symptoms and the risks of atrial fibrilation.

      The study design includes three study arms:

        1. ARENA Intervention:

           This project will examine the effectiveness of population education and other measures
           to provide care for patients with atrial fibrillation.

           In the end of the control phase (1 year recruitment of approximately 10,000 patients),
           there will be a wide publicity, informing about the disease.

        2. ARENA Medication:

           ARENA records the patient's complete medication at all survey times (up to two weeks
           after recruitment and follow up). This allows an accurate assessment of interactions
           between individual substances.

           In addition, attempts are being made to determine drug concentrations of anticoagulants
           directly by the blood of the patient. Therefore, patients are provided with kits, which
           they can use to apply a drop of blood from your fingertip to a filter paper. The aim is
           to examine the patient's adherence and to analyze whether there are any complications.

        3. ARENA Migration:

      The Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar is characterized by a high proportion of people with a
      Turkish migration background. ARENA migration aims to examine whether a targeted population
      education can improve the care of this patient group.
