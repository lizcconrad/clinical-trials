  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope, or transient loss of consciousness/fainting, is a common emergency department (ED)
      complaint responsible for over 1 million ED visits yearly. Potential causes include benign
      conditions such as dehydration or vaso-vagal syncope. Rarely, syncope is the result of
      serious cardiac conditions. In older patients without a clear cause of syncope hospital
      admission is frequently initiated at very low risk thresholds, though there is little
      evidence that these admissions improve patient outcomes. These decisions are often made
      without significant patient input or discussion of reasonable alternatives. In this
      situation, a patient's values, preferences, and particular circumstances should be taken into
      account. This mutualistic approach to clinical management is referred to as Shared
      Decision-Making. Shared Decision-Making (SDM) is a joint process of choice selection between
      providers and patients in clinical scenarios where multiple reasonable management options
      exist. To improve syncope emergency care, the researchers can leverage recent advances in
      risk stratification to engage patients in SDM and deliver superior, patient-centered care.

      This study will provide the groundwork for a larger, randomized controlled trial evaluating
      the effects of the decision aid for management of low-risk syncope.

      Setting:

      Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) has a 61-bed adult Emergency Department with a volume of over
      100,000 patient visits/year or approximately 300 visits/day. MSH is a large academic tertiary
      care medical center located in East Harlem and serves a large black and Hispanic community.

      Projected Recruitment: There are approximately 60 MSH ED visits for syncope per month of
      which 35 per month are by patients above age 40. Roughly half of these do not have a clear
      etiology of their syncope discovered in the ED. The researchers project that of the 17
      potentially eligible patients per month, three will be successfully enrolled for a projected
      72 patient enrollees at the completion of the 24-month recruitment period. The PI, clinical
      research coordinators, and SRAs will monitor the real-time electronic tracking system for all
      ED patients and will identify any patient over age 40 with a chief complaint of syncope or
      loss of consciousness.

    <description>Decisional quality will be measured by administering the Decisional Conflict Scale to all patients after disposition decision has been made. The decisional conflict scale has 16 items, each item is scored from 0 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). 16 items are summed, divided by 16 and multiplied by 25 giving total score range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict)</description>

OPTION sum scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating higher levels of patient involvement.</description>
