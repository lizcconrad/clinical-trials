  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To ensure a successful outcome after total knee replacement (TKR) soft tissue balance and
      proper implant position are very important during the surgical procedure. Soft tissues are
      structures in the knee including ligaments, muscles, tendons, and menisci that stabilize and
      cushion the knee joint. Lack of proper soft tissue balance or imprecise implant positioning
      may result in knee stiffness, pain, instability and limited range of motion (ROM). This may
      result in implant failure and the need for revision surgery. As part of standard practice
      orthopedic surgeons use a manual knee balancer device to help guide soft tissue balancing to
      achieve optimal knee balance. New sensor-assisted technology can provide surgeons with
      measurable information to help achieve soft tissue balancing, providing surgeons with
      immediate visual feedback during the surgery. This feedback, transmitted wirelessly by the
      sensor, gives surgeons electronic information on soft tissue balance and implant position.The
      purpose of this study is to determine if a sensor guided soft tissue balancing device
      (Verasense) is more effective at balancing the knee during surgery as compared to standard
      soft tissue balancing performed with a manual balancer device.

      The study is that of a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of patients
      presenting for elective primary TKR to compare the outcomes of TKR using conventional soft
      tissue balancing with a tensiometer device versus augmenting the soft tissue balancing with
      the OrthoSensor VerasenseTM sensor device. The primary outcome will be rate of unbalanced
      TKRs based on the quantitative Verasense definition of a well balanced knee defined as a
      mediolateral intercompartmental loading difference of ≤15 pounds through ROM. Secondary
      outcomes include differences in clinical outcome scores and patient satisfaction among sensor
      guided cases and controls.

      Patients will be randomized to receive TKR with the Triathlon total knee system (Stryker) in
      the case and control group according to: (1) control group with standard balancing techniques
      used and sensor data obtained in blinded fashion and not used to balance the TKR implant, (2)
      experimental case group with sensor guided balancing where sensor data is used to balance the
      TKR within defined parameters.

    <description>In the control group where the sensor device is not used in optimization of knee balance and alignment, definitive implants will be cemented in place and the sensor trial inserted using a thickness based on prior standard bearing insert trialing. Peak load data will be captured intraoperatively through full ROM. Custom shims will be affixed to the sensor to replicate thickness of the standard trial. The knee will then be cycled and loads recorded in the medial and lateral compartments at 10, 45 and 90 degrees of flexion. The surgeon will be blinded to the sensor output and the system will be located outside of their visual field.</description>

    <description>In the experimental group where the sensor device is used to optimize balance and alignment, the sensor trial will be inserted and tibial baseplate rotated until medial and lateral femoral contact points are parallel on the sensor output. Quantitative balance is defined as a mediolateral intercompartmental loading difference of ≤15 pounds. Flexion balance is achieved when femoral contact point position is within the midposterior third of the tibial insert and intercompartmental loads are balanced. Loads in the medial and lateral compartments are recorded at 10, 45 and 90 degrees. If compartment loads differ by &gt;15 lbs between compartments, unbalanced, further soft tissue release/bone resection will be done to achieve a side to side compartment pressure difference of &lt;15 lbs through ROM.</description>
