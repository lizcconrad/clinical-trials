      To compare the MT005 (MiStent) with the XIENCE with respect to target lesion failure (TLF) at
      12 months in a non-inferiority trial in a &quot;real world&quot; patient population and to confirm that
      the domestic extrapolation of the DESSOLVE III study results is valid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 1:1 balanced, controlled, double-blind, multi-center study
      comparing clinical outcomes at 12 months between MT005 (MiStent) and XIENCE in an all-comers
      population, including patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease including patients
      with chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, and acute coronary syndromes, who qualify for
      percutaneous coronary interventions.
