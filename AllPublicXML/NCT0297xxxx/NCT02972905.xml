  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is a potent and highly selective inhaled Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) delta
      inhibitor being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective agent for the treatment
      of inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
      purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single and repeat doses of GSK2269557 administered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI)
      to healthy Japanese subjects. This is the first time for Japanese subjects that GSK2269557
      will be administered via the ELLIPTA DPI with the addition of magnesium stearate.

      In each group of this study, subjects will receive a single dose of either GSK2269557 or
      placebo in Session 1 and receive daily dose of GSK2269557 or placebo for 10 days in Session
      2. Session 1 of the next dose strength may be run in parallel with the Session 2 of the
      previous dose. The doses planned for the study are 200 micrograms (mcg), 500 mcg and 700 mcg.
      There will be at least 10 days washout between the two dosing sessions. Follow up period will
      start 10 days (+-1 day) after the last dose of Session 2. A total number of 36 subjects will
      be enrolled for the study with 27 subjects receiving a dose strength of GSK2269557 and 9
      subjects will receive each dose strength of GSK2269557. ELLIPTA is a trademark of the GSK
      group of companies.

    <time_frame>Approximately up to 37 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persisting disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment will be categorized as SAE.</description>
