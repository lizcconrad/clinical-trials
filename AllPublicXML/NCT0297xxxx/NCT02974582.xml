  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Smoking is a major public health problem in the U.S. Almost a half a million Americans die
      from it in a year. One thing that contributes to why people smoke is the marketing of
      cigarettes. Cigarette direct mail marketing usually targets young smokers of lower
      socioeconomic status. Researchers want to find out more about how this kind of marketing
      influences smoking behavior in young people from different socioeconomic levels.

      Objectives:

      To study the effects of cigarette direct mail marketing on beliefs, responses, and arousal.
      To study how these things may differ among young adult smokers of high and low socioeconomic
      status.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18 to 29 who smoke.

      Design:

      Participants will have 1 visit.

      Participants will be asked questions about their health and recent smoking.

      A nurse will check their vital signs.

      Participants will have a simple eye exam.

      They will give blood and urine samples.

      Participants will be connected to equipment. This will collect data while they look at
      pictures.

      Then they will have a 10-minute break. A nurse will observe them during the break.

      Participants will have their breath analyzed.

      Participants will answer questions. The topics will include:

      Education

      Job

      Income

      Family history

      Tobacco use

      Exposure to pro-smoking and anti-smoking messages

      History of drug and alcohol use

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking remains a public health problem in the US, and cigarette marketing has been concluded
      as one of the causal factors for the epidemic. Previous studies on cigarette direct mail
      marketing yielded a limited data on mechanisms influencing smoking behavior. Therefore, there
      is a need for a study that would provide a stronger evidence on how direct mail marketing
      influences smoking behavior. The prosed study will consist of two parts where pilot data are
      to be collected in Part 1, and further data are to be collected in Part 2 conducted as a
      randomized comparative trial. Up to a total of 530 healthy volunteers ages 18-29 are to be
      recruited for the study. After meeting the eligibility and enrolling onto the study,
      participants will have their biospecimens collected followed by an experiment in which they
      are to be shown images on the computer. Study participants will then take a break and
      afterwards will provide additional sociodemographic and psychosocial information through an
      audio computer assisted self-administered interview.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age: 18 to 29 years, given our focus on young adults.

          -  Smoking status: Current smokers who report smoking every day and who have smoked at
             least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

          -  Gender: Both male and female

          -  SES: For the purpose of the study, we will use the empirical groups from our analysis
             of the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement data. Two groups are chosen
             based on their social determinants and prevalence of smoking.

               1. Low SES: Young adults who do not have a four-year college degree, are not
                  currently enrolled in a four-year college, were born in the US, and have an
                  annual income less than $50,000. This is the group that has been shown to have
                  the highest prevalence of smoking.

               2. High SES: Young adults who are currently enrolled in or graduated from a four
                  year college. This is the group that has been shown to have the lowest prevalence
                  of smoking.

          -  English proficiency: since study materials are available only in English, only
             participants who are able to understand English and follow instructions in English are
             to be enrolled.

          -  Cognitive ability: Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  General health: Participants need to be generally healthy, as defined as someone with
             no known significant health problems. Participants can have chronic health conditions
             if the condition is well managed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Inability, in the judgment of the investigator, to understand and follow the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Currently enrolled in high school.

          -  Participants with eye conditions that restrict their ability to track an object with
             their eyes.

          -  Participants with myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism who cannot pass a simple
             vision test even with corrective lenses.

          -  Participants with medical condition(s) that may be triggered by infrared radiation
             (e.g., epilepsy).

          -  Self-reported use of alcohol, recreational drugs or prescription medications used for
             recreational purposes (e. i. amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, ketamines, LSD,
             opiates and opioids, tranquilizers or opioid analgesics) that may influence their
             judgement at the time of study in the past 12 hours before the study visit.
