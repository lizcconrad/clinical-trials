    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study the investigators will report on 20 male subjects
      with proven WHO-classification Zika infection. These subjects will be followed up for a
      maximum of 12 months to observe the presence, viral load and infectivity of Zika virus (ZIKV)
      in semen over time.

      In this prospective observational study the investigators will report on 20 male subjects
      with proven WHO-classification Zika infection. These subjects will be followed up for a
      maximum of 12 months to observe the presence, viral load and infectivity of Zika virus (ZIKV)
      in semen over time.

      Knowledge of the possible presence, infectivity and persistence of ZIKV in semen will provide
      evidence-based data for

        1. estimating of the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV in the general population

        2. antenatal guidelines for the prevention of sexual transmission of ZIKV to the fetus

        3. advising couples on the length of time that pregnancy should be avoided in women wishing
           to conceive after their partner's ZIKV infection

        4. strategies to prevent transmission of ZIKV infection through assisted reproductive
           treatment (ART)

        5. advice on gamete cryopreservation

        6. optimising investigations for diagnosis of ZIKV in males.

    <description>Every two weeks subjects provide a semen sample which is analysed and then frozen for RT-PCR and viral load. Semen sample testing for the presence of ZIKV (Institute of Tropical Medicine, Belgium) will be performed using both a ZIKV-specific, in-house duplex real-time RT-PCR, targeting a 102bp and 121bp sequence of the NS5 gene and the RealStar® Zika Virus RT-PCR Kit (Altona). Quantitative viral load RNA measurements will be expressed utilizing threshold cycle values because a standardized viral load reference method is not available. To test for infectivity of ZIKV in semen, ZIKV isolation will be attempted in semen samples with a high viral ZIKV load (i.e. positive ZIKV PCR result and Ct-values below 30) by inoculation in Vero cells.</description>
