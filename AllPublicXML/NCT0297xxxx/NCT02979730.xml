  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare Emergency Department patients who undergo influenza
      testing using an FDA-approved point-of-care device (Cobas Liat Influenza A/B assay) located
      in the ED, to patients whose samples are sent to the BMC central laboratory. Patients who
      agree to participate will have their samples randomly assigned to be tested on either at the
      core lab, or on the POC device. The current turnaround time for samples sent to the
      laboratory is approximately two hours; investigators expect that the point of care device can
      reduce this time. Investigators will determine if the time to disposition and the
      administration of antibiotics is different in the group undergoing POC influenza testing
      compared to those undergoing laboratory-based influenza testing

    <description>For patients with clinical concern for influenza, the usual workflow in the BMC ED is that physicians order the collection of a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) for influenza A/B testing to be performed in the core microbiology laboratory using one of two assays. The two influenza A/B-only assays available in the core lab are a) an instrumented fluorescent immunoassay rapid antigen test, the Sofia influenza A+B FIA (Quidel Corporation) and b) an automated real-time PCR test, the Xpert Flu (Cepheid, Inc.). Which test is ordered is at the discretion of the physician. Both the Sofia and Xpert assays provide a result callout to distinguish influenza type A from type B.</description>

    <description>Prior to the study the Cobas Liat Influenza A/B assay will be verified for patient care at BMC. The instrument and test kits will be available in the ED for use with study subjects randomized to this study arm. The Cobas Liat assay provides a result callout to distinguish influenza type A from type B.</description>
