  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      HZ/su vaccine on Quality of Life (QoL) in adults ≥ 50 years of age
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the impact of HZ/su vaccination on the QoL, 400 adults ≥ 50 years of
      age (YOA). Subjects will be asked to respond to a series of SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires
      before and after vaccination following a 2 month schedule. To estimate the impact of
      reactogenicity on an individual's physical functioning (PF) and QoL, the study will compare
      subject questionnaire responses made during two periods, i.e., pre-vaccination and
      post-vaccination. The difference will be considered to be the effect of vaccination and
      reactogenicity on the PF and QoL. To characterize the study population and determine if
      frailty may influence reactogenicity and consequently the impact on QoL scores, the subjects'
      frailty status will be assessed at the first inclusion visit. In addition to the SF-36 and
      EQ-5D questionnaires, a more complete characterization of the reactogenicity of the vaccine
      will be made by including a detailed collection of the use of healthcare resources and the
      occurrence of symptoms through diary card data collection. Impact on days of work loss, both
      for the subject or for a caregiver, as applicable, will also be assessed.
