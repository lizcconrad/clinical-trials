      This study evaluates the use of the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT), which creates
      an image of the symptoms the participant is experiencing, for improving symptom
      self-management in adolescents and young adults with cancer. In this one-group trial,
      participants will complete the C-SCAT and use it during two clinic visits with their oncology
      providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unrelieved symptoms lead to poorer quality of life for adolescents and young adults (AYAs)
      with cancer. Strategies are needed to help AYAs manage symptoms. The investigators developed
      the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT), a novel way to assess symptoms where AYAs
      create a picture of their symptoms using images and text on an iPad app. The resulting image
      shows symptoms/symptom clusters, priority symptoms and relationships between symptoms and has
      potential to support AYA's symptom self-management. Facilitating the self-management process,
      including self-efficacy, self-regulation behaviors, and patient-provider communication, is
      essential for improving symptom outcomes.

    <description>C-SCAT is an investigator developed app that is delivered via an iPad. The original CSCAT included the 30 symptoms from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. The recently updated version includes two additional symptoms &quot;feeling bloated&quot; and &quot;sexual dysfunction&quot; that are included in the adult version of the MSAS.21 These symptoms were added based on feedback from the initial AYA sample of 13-29 year olds and in consideration of the developmental perspectives of the AYA population.The CSCAT allows the user to create an image of his or her symptom experience.</description>
