      The objective of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to evaluate patients' adherence and
      persistence to carfilzomib therapy in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or
      dexamethasone alone in adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least
      one prior therapy in a real-life setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dual combination of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) (R) and dexamethasone (d) (Rd) is a standard
      regimen to treat MM patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Recently published
      clinical data indicate that the next-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Kyprolis®)
      (K) may substantially change the treatment paradigm for patients with relapsed MM (RMM).

      To compare the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib in combination with Rd (KRd) with the dual
      combination therapy Rd, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase III study was performed
      in patients with RMM (ASPIRE, NCT01080391).2 After cycle 18, carfilzomib was discontinued in
      the KRd arm, but Rd administration was continued thereafter until disease progression. The
      trial met its primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) (Hazard Ratio (HR) for
      progression or death, 0.69; p=0.0001). Median PFS was 26.3 months with KRd treatment compared
      to 17.6 months with Rd treatment. The study further demonstrates that carfilzomib improves
      patients' overall survival (OS) rate at 24 months (KRd, 73.3% vs. Rd, 65.0%; HR for death,
      0.79; p=0.04) and overall response rate (ORR) (KRd, 87.1% vs. Rd, 66.7%; p&lt;0.001). Objective
      assessment of adverse events (AEs) and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) revealed that the
      benefit-risk ratio is favorable for the three-drug combination KRd.

      To compare the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) with
      the dual combination bortezomib and dexamethasone, a randomized, multicenter, open-label
      phase III study was performed in patients with RMM (ENDEAVOR, NCT01568866). Patients in both
      arms received treatment until progression. Results of the preplanned interim analysis show,
      that the trial met its primary endpoint PFS (HR for progression or death, 0.53; p&lt;0.0001).
      Median PFS was 18.7 months with Kd treatment compared to 9.4 months with Vd treatment. In
      addition, the Kd combination therapy demonstrated superiority over the Vd combination therapy
      for secondary objectives, like ORR (77% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.0001) and median duration of response
      (DOR) (21.3 months vs. 10.4 months). OS data were not available at time of analysis. Despite
      higher rates for cardiac and renal failure as well as higher incidence of hypertension and
      dyspnea in the Kd arm, carfilzomib given as a 30 min infusion has an acceptable safety
      profile, particularly with respect to lower peripheral neuropathy events. The number of
      patients who had ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy was significantly higher in the Vd group
      than in the Kd group (32% vs. 6%). In conclusion, data of the ENDEAVOR study demonstrate,
      that carfilzomib given in combination with dexamethasone has a favorable benefit-risk profile
      and provides an important new treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory MM
      (RRMM).

      Up to now, no real-life data on patients' adherence, persistence, quality of life (QoL) and
      patterns of use, effectiveness and safety of the KRd and Kd regimen have been systematically
      collected and analyzed. Thus, after market approval of KRd and Kd as treatment for patients
      with MM who have received at least one prior therapy, the purpose of the CARO NIS is to
      evaluate patients' adherence, persistence and QoL as well as effectiveness and safety of the
      KRd regimen and the Kd regimen in a real-life setting.
