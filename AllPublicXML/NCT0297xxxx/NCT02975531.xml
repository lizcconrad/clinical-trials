      Parameterize the Pompage technique with an anatomical model cervical region to simulate
      specific procedures. Quantify the times, displacements, and facilitate the training of
      students and professional of physical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Manual techniques are taught and trained with practical demonstration without technology
      support to measure them, so they are difficult to reproduce. This difficulty increases in
      Pompage technique because the student is not able to estimate the displacement on the skin.
      In this research, to parameterize and train the technique was developed and validated an
      anatomical model of the cervical region, with silicone and latex rubber. The anatomical model
      simulates the soft tissues and a plastic resin structure represents the cervical spine bone.
      An optical sensor was used to measure the displacements performed on simulated skin versus
      time. The Likert scale was used for assessing the similarity of the anatomical model relative
      to the size, shape, texture, elasticity and displacement of the skin as well as the curvature
      of the cervical spine. Five experienced professionals (GP) in the technical performed five
      series of Pompage technique. With the mean of data collected were determined benchmarks for
      technical and implemented in a standard guide to train the volunteers. Twenty-six volunteers
      (GE) with no experience performed the Pompage technique, with the anatomical model following
      the standard guide. A physical therapist (VE) was selected to evaluate the volunteers (GE)
      before and after training in the simulator.

    <description>Five physiotherapists (GP) with at least 5 years of experience in the technique were selected to perform the technique on the simulator and complete a questionnaire in order to evaluate the texture and skin elasticity, the curvature and size of the cervical spine format. They scored these items from the Likert scale. After evaluation they used the simulator to generate a standard guide training.</description>
