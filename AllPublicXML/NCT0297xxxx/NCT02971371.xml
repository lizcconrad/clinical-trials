  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of repetitive task practice by using robotic
      devices, including Lokomat, for the treatment of lower limb paresis. Virtual reality (VR) has
      proved to be a valuable tool to improve neurorehabilitation training. Our pilot randomized
      clinical trial aimed at evaluating the correlation between the modifications of brain
      oscillations during a VR neurorehabilitative training of gait and the motor function recovery
      in patients with chronic stroke.

      Twenty-four patients suffering from a first unilateral ischemic stroke in the chronic phase
      were randomized into two groups. One group performed 40 sessions of Lokomat with VR (RAGT+VR)
      whereas the other group underwent Lokomat without VR (RAGT-VR). Outcomes (clinical,
      kinematic, and event-related synchronization, ERS, and desynchronization, ERD, at the EEG)
      were measured before and after the robotic intervention.

      The robotic-based rehabilitation combined with VR could be associated with improvements in
      several measurements of lower limb function, gait, and balance in patient with chronic
      hemiparesis. Moreover, ERS/ERD analysis can be proposed as a tool to monitor motor
      performance and to develop non-invasive brain-computer interfaces controlling robotic
      devices.

    <description>Both the groups performed 40 45min Lokomat sessions, five times a week, between 9am and 11am. The &quot;RAGT&quot;and &quot;VR&quot; group received a visual feedback showing a VR run game where the patient had to collect or avoid objects, to motivate him/her to walk actively. Each avatar's leg movement corresponded to that performed by the patient. On the other hand, the &quot;RAGT&quot; without &quot;VR&quot; group was not provided an avatar, and a smile indicating the goodness of each leg movement. The biofeedback of the Lokomat gait orthosis is based on the interaction torques between the participant and the orthosis</description>
