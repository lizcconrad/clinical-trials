      Objective To determine the optimum treatment protocol of auriculotherapy (AT) on the
      improvement of sleep conditions and quality of life on the elders with insomnia.

      Research hypothesis The use of combined LAT plus MAT is more effective than MAT/LAT alone on
      the improvement of sleep conditions and quality of life in the elderly with insomnia.

      Design and subjects This is a 3-arm double-blinded randomised trial. Subjects aged ≥65 and
      exhibit poor sleep conditions are recruited.

      Interventions Group 1: Subjects will receive a deactivated laser treatment followed by MAT.
      Group 2: Subjects will receive LAT and placebo MAT. Group 3: Subjects will receive a combined
      approach (LAT plus MAT).

      The treatment will be delivered 3 times/week, with a 6-week treatment period, on seven
      specific auricular points.

      Main outcome measures Sleep conditions and quality of life will be evaluated at baseline; end
      of 6-week treatment; and at 6-week, 12-week, and 6-month follow-up periods.

      Data analysis Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, ANOVA, paired t-test, and mixed
      effect modeling will be conducted as appropriate.

      Expected results This study would advance our knowledge the optimum treatment protocol of AT
      in the improvement of the sleep conditions of the elderly population.

    <description>for collecting data related to the sleep patterns of the subjects. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with a score greater than five indicating poor sleep quality. Chong and Cheung19 have validated the Cantonese-PSQI and have reported a high internal consistency of 0.75.</description>

    <measure>Sleep latency</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Actiwatch 2 Device with 0.025G ultra-high sensitivity will be used for data collection. Sleep parameters, including sleep latency, waking after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency are identified. Participants have to wear the device for 7 consecutive days, 24 hours a day, for each timepoint measurements on the wrist of the non-dominant hand to determine the overall sleep conditions within a certain period. Removal (if any) of the actiwatch should be recorded in a logbook. Sleep latency refers to the length of time it takes from lying down for the night until sleep onset.</description>

    <description>To achieve a blinding and placebo effect of the subject, the laser device will be switched to &quot;power off&quot; mode (i.e. deactivated laser) for acupoint &quot;stimulation&quot; before the application of MAT. The subjects will be asked to wear a pair of laser protective goggles so as to &quot;blind&quot; them during treatment.</description>

    <description>A laser device (Pointer Pulse™)15 will be used in this study. This device has a wavelength of 650 nm, an average output power of 2.5 mW, an energy density of 1 minute with 0.54 J/cm,2 and a pulse of 10 Hz, which is a common acceptable dosage for clinical use. 16, 17 This application is a low-energy laser therapy (LLLT), in which the energy level emitted from the device is approximately comparable to a teaching pointer. A 1-minute treatment using the continuous mode of the device will be directly applied to the selected acupoints. Laser protective goggles will be provided to the subjects and the researcher for eyes protection</description>
