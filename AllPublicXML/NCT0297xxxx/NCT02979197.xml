  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety
      of amlodipine on renal and vascular function in subjects with existing hypertension requiring
      antihypertensive therapy.

      Kitov Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug
      product (FCDP) consisting of the antihypertensive drug amlodipine besylate and the
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib.

      KIT-302 is being developed as a &quot;convenience reformulation&quot; FCDP to facilitate and improve
      patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components,
      amlodipine and celecoxib, when used together for the treatment of hypertension, to lower
      blood pressure, in patients who also require the use of an NSAID for relief of the signs and
      symptoms of osteoarthritis. It is also intended to provide prescribers with detailed data on
      how the combination affects the antihypertensive effect of the calcium channel blocker.

      The formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a
      single immediate release tablet. However, for this study, two separate capsules will be
      utilized: one containing a commercial celecoxib capsule (Celebrex®) or matched placebo
      capsule and one containing a commercial amlodipine besylate tablet (Norvasc®) or matched
      placebo tablet.

      Kitov recently completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed
      hypertension (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was
      statistically non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood
      pressure. Further, trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal
      function were observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) is being conducted to
      quantify the beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with
      existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Resting SBP &gt; 169 mmHg or a resting DBP &gt; 110 mmHg at initial screening visit while on
