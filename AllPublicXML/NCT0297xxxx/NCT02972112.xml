  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women in their 3rd trimester, represent a unique segment of the tokophobic population. In
      these cases help is needed within a very short and limited period of time. To date, no
      specific treatment targets this population in order to ameliorate the anxiety and to provide
      these women and their newborns with better obstetric and psychiatric outcomes. The present
      study investigates an accessible individual two session intervention conducted by midwives
      skilled in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) . This intervention is designed to enable
      stronger emotional regulation and increase of their capacity to accept unexpected changes
      during labor and feelings of control. The investigators expect this psychological adjustment
      to lead to a better course of delivery, less interventions including caesarian sections, and
      subjective birth experience.
