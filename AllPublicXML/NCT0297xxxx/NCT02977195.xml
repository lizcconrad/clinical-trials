  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most advanced solid tumors, current therapy is inadequate at improving quality of life,
      slowing progression of disease, prolonging survival, and providing a cure. Hence, there is a
      continuous need for innovative, safer and more effective anti-cancer therapies. Our study is
      based on the dependence receptor paradigm and the associated therapeutic strategy. In
      preclinical models, preventing Netrin-1 interaction with its receptors is sufficient to
      trigger Netrin-1-expressing tumor cell death in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis
      inhibition in vivo. This indicates that a therapeutic approach based on Netrin-1/Netrin-1
      receptors interaction inhibition is both feasible and promising. NP137 is a &quot;first-in-class&quot;
      humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Netrin-1 ligand, a secreted protein recently
      described as a driver of tumor initiation and progression. NP137 demonstrated anti-tumor
      activity as a single agent in several pre-clinical models of cancer, including breast and
      lung cancer. Taken together, several studies strongly support the rational for preclinical
      development and clinical evaluation of a highly potent and selective anti-Netrin-1 antibody
      in cancer patients. The proposed study is an open label, multicenter, Phase I dose escalation
      study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of NP137 administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) as single agent in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This trial will be the First in
      Human (FIH) study for NP137; there is no clinical experience with this antibody in the
      clinic. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1) a dose escalation part to define the Maximum
      tolerated dose and the Recommended Phase II dose (MTD /RP2D) of NP137 as well as to research
      some PD biomarkers (Biological collection cohorts) an expansion part to assess the PD and
      anti-tumor activity of NP137.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part (NP137 administered as a single agent by intravenous injection with
      up to 7 ascending dose levels) will be initiated with an accelerated dose titration with 1
      patient per DL until the occurrence of a ≥ Grade 2 drug-related AE. Following the occurrence
      of such moderate toxicity, patients will be enrolled in a slower dose escalation design with
      at least 3 patients per DL using a Modified Continual Reassessment Method. Of note, in case
      no toxicity occurs up to the DL4, the classical 3+3 design will be initiated. Cohorts of
      patients with biopsable disease will be added in order to assess the impact of NP137
      treatment on epithelial phenotype signature (assessed by RNAseq and subsequent bioinformatic
      profiling using published E vs M score). Up to 4 additional and independent cohorts of
      patients (n= up to 6 pts/ cohort) with biopsable disease will be enrolled. Starting from DL4,
      the enrolment in such cohort will be allowed at highest DL that has cleared its DLT
      assessment window. Such cohorts will allow to collect pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies in
      order to identify PD biomarkers correlated to NP137 clinical activity.

      In the expansion part, patients will be treated at the RP2D defined in Part 1.

      In both parts, NP137 will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic
      deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an
      integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent or
      patient willingness to stop the treatment.
