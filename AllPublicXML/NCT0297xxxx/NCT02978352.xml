  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness characterized by reduced
      attention, impaired cognition and perception, usually resulting from general physical
      conditions. Delirium contributes to longer hospital length of stay, increased mortality,
      increased healthcare costs, and long-term cognitive and functional impairment. However, it is
      often underdiagnosed and undertreated. E-learning (electronic learning) proves to be a
      time-efficient, flexible and convenient training method, making it suitable for a large
      organization like Siriraj hospital where there is a large employee turnover rate. So the
      investigators want to compare the passing rate between the e-learning group and the
      traditional learning group.

      Primary objective: Compare the passing rate between the e-learning group and the traditional
      learning group

      Secondary objectives: Assess the trainees' satisfaction and problems associated with
      e-learning implementation, Investigate the causes of inaccurate CAM-ICU assessment for
      improvement in future training sessions
