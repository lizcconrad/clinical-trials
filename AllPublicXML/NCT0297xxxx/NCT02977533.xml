      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of GZ402668 after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose in
      men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess in men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis:

        -  The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GZ402668 after a single SC dose.

        -  The pharmacodynamic (PD) response to GZ402668 after a single SC dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration from screening for a patient can be approximately up to 8 weeks.
      Upon completion of this trial, patients treated with GZ402668 will be required to enroll in a
      4 year safety follow-up study for continued safety observation.
