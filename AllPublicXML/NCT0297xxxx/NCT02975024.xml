      Apply the LSCI for follow-up the postoperative microcirculation after surgical procedures to
      enlarge keratinized gingiva in order to characterize the kinetics of the blood flow changes
      during wound healing in human subjects.

    <textblock>
      Vestibuloplasty is the common name of those procedures designed to widen the zone of attached
      gingiva. The apically repositioned split thickness flap with a xenogeneic collagen matrix or
      with a combination of strip gingival graft and a xenogeneic collagen matrix are frequently
      used surgical techniques, however no data are available, how these graft tissues affect the
      microcirculation of the healing gingiva.

      LSCI is a non-invasive, two dimensional method to evaluate microcirculation of different
      tissues. This new method let us monitor the entire surgical area real-time during the healing
      period.

      The aim of the present study is to define blood flow patterns, which might characterize the
      wound healing of such surgical procedures during the first 6 months of healing in order to
      facilitate treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative blood flow changes of the oral mucosa</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow changes are measured by Laser Speckle Contrast Imager (LSCI) after mandibular vestibuloplasty. The scale is an arbitrary unit (0-3000 LSPU) and the relative changes to the surgically unaffected surrounding mucosa measurements are calculated. Postoperative follow-up time-points are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, 28 days, and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months. The apically repositioned split thickness flap is combined either with a Mucograft alone, or with a combination of autologous strip gingival graft and Mucograft. The differences in postoperative blood flow changes are compared between the two surgical techniques.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound fluid volume measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Wound fluid sample is collected using a filter strip to withdraw the fluid around the wound. The filter strip is then inserted into Periotron 8010 instrument to score the volume on the paper. Scores are measured in an arbitrary unit. Postoperative follow-up time-points are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14 days. The apically repositioned split thickness flap is combined either with a Mucograft alone, or with a combination of autologous strip gingival graft and Mucograft. The differences in postoperative wound fluid changes are compared between the two surgical techniques.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the periodontal parameters at teeth at the surgical site: a composite outcome measure consisting of multiple measures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and six month postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Periodontal parameters are evaluated using a periodontal probe and will be expressed in mm. The following will be assessed at each tooth at the surgical site: probing depth, depth and width of recession, papilla height, and width and thickness of the keratinized gingiva. Surgical area is also measured apico-coronally and mesio-distally, during the whole follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative determination of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) of the wound fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Wound fluid sample for VEGF is collected at the fourth postoperative day. For the quantitative determination of VEGF in samples the Human VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit will be used. The apically repositioned split thickness flap is combined either with a Mucograft alone, or with a combination of autologous strip gingival graft and Mucograft. The differences in postoperative wound fluid level of VEGF (expressed in conc pg/mL) are compared between the two surgical techniques.</description>
