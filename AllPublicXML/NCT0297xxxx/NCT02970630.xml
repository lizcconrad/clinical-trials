      (Extended Criteria Donor) kidney grafts treated with Envarsus® prolonged release tablets in
      combination with everolimus tablets.

          3. Patients who are planned to receive a renal allograft by Extended Criteria Donor
             (ECD);

          4. Patients capable of understanding the purposes and risks of the study, who can give
             written informed consent and who are willing to participate in and comply with the
             study;

          5. Patients with low to standard immunological risk, who had a PRA (Panel Reactive
             Antibody) ≤ 20% (PRA testing according to centre's practice);

          6. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 15 and 35 kg/m2 extremes inclusive;

          7. Women must be postmenopausal (physiologic menopause defined as &quot;12 consecutive months
             of amenorrhea&quot;) or permanently sterilized (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
             bilateral salpingectomy) to be enrolled in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recipients of any transplanted organ other than a single or dual kidney;

          2. Patients unable or unwilling to provide informed consent;

             from the time of first dose administration and until 8 weeks after the last dose of
             study drugs. Male subjects with partners of non-childbearing potential are not
             required to use contraception.

             Reliable methods of contraception for male subjects and their partner of childbearing
             potential must be one of the following:

               1. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system

               2. Hormonal contraception (implantable, patch, oral)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical
                  vaults/caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

               4. Male sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
                  absence of sperm in the ejaculate &quot;True abstinence&quot; is acceptable only if it is
                  in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

          4. Recipients of a bone marrow or stem cell transplant;

          5. Recipients of a kidney from a cardiac death donor;

          6. Recipients of a kidney from an ABO (0, A and blood cell types) incompatible donor;

             objectives;

         13. Patients with severe diarrhoea, vomiting, active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal
             disorder that may affect the absorption of study drugs;

         14. Patients with a white blood cell count ≤ 2.8x109/L unless the absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) is ≥ 1.0x109/L;

         15. Patients with a platelet count ≤ 50.0x109/L;

         16. Patients with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             enzyme levels &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal during the 30 days prior to the

             (Anti-thymocyte globulin) alone or patients who did not start rabbit ATG induction
             therapy after transplant;

         20. Patients who are already on immunosuppressive drugs the day before transplantation,
             except ATG as per protocol;

         21. Patients who are planned to receive therapy with any immunosuppressive agent other
             than those prescribed in the study;

         22. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to corticosteroids, tacrolimus or everolimus or
             sirolimus or any of the excipients present in study drugs formulations;

         23. Patients with hypersensitivity to macrolides;

         24. Patients with any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or a condition that,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the
             Investigator;

         25. Subjects unlikely to comply with the study protocol or unable to understand the nature
             and scope of the study but also the possible benefits or unwanted effects of the study
             treatments;

         26. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this study.
