  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in a single center, open-label study with a single group fixed
      sequence design to evaluate the effect of repeated oral administration of 600 mg
      RIF(Rifampicin) given once daily over 11 days on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of
      VPR(Vilaprisan) and on MDZ(Midazolam) as a reference (probe) substance.
