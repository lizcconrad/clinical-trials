  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraperitoneal immunotherapy (with
      interleykin-2 - human cytokine reaction activator) with systemic chemotherapy will be more
      effective than systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with gastric cancer and verified free
      cancer cells in abdominal cavity in improving the long term outcomes and overall survival of
      further surgical treatment.
