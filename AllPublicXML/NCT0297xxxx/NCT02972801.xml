  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an experimental procedure where a young boy's
      testicular tissue is retrieved and frozen. This technique is reserved for young male patients
      who are not yet producing mature sperm, with the ultimate goal that their tissue may be used
      in the future to restore fertility when experimental techniques emerge from the research
      pipeline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fertility status has an important impact on the post-treatment quality of life for cancer
      survivors and other patients that receive gonadotoxic therapies (e.g., prior to bone marrow
      transplantation). Semen cryopreservation is an established fertility preserving therapy, but
      is not accessible or appropriate for all men. Currently there are no therapies to preserve
      the future fertility of preadolescent boys. However, new reproductive therapies are under
      development and may one day offer &quot;fertile hope&quot; to those survivors that do not currently
      have access to fertility preserving therapies. Clinical management of fertility threatening
      diseases and treatments must have foresight of the gonadotoxic side effects and the potential
      for infertility. When no established fertility sparing options are available, it is
      reasonable to offer harvesting and cryopreservation of testicular tissue as a possible means
      of fertility preservation.

      This study will harvest testicular tissue from eligible patients. Separate portions of the
      harvested tissue and/or cells will be 1) designated for research and 2) cryopreserved and
      maintained for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures to attempt
      fertility restoration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be male at any age.

          -  Be scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the
             treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.

          -  Or, have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of one
             or both testicles.

          -  Have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Those who were not enrolled at the time of
             initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with recurrent disease) are eligible if they have
             not previously received therapy that is viewed as likely to result in complete and
             permanent loss of testicular function.

          -  Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of all or part of a testicle for
             fertility preservation only. Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility
             preservation options.

          -  Sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of personal
             health information. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must
             acknowledge in writing that consent for specimen collection has been obtained, in
             accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and

          -  Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases [HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B,
             Hepatitis C, RDR (Syphilis), CMV, HTLV-1, and HTLV-2], to be performed at the time of
             testicular tissue harvesting.

          -  Undergo a full history and physical examination and obtain standard pre-operative
             clearance (based on the most recent ACC/AHA Guideline for Perioperative Cardiovascular
             Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by their primary surgeon.

          -  Participating in long term follow-up is a requirement of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving
             fully informed consent.

          -  Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their risk
             of complications from anesthesia and surgery.
