  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators of this study want to see if shortening the total treatment time for brain
      tumors is safe.The treatment for participant's brain tumors is laser surgery (Laser
      Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)) followed by radiation with chemotherapy. For
      participants, the total time of treatment from surgery to the end of radiation and
      chemotherapy is about l 0 weeks long. This study asks whether it is safe to shorten the total
      treatment to 7 weeks.

      To shorten the total treatment time, investigators want to see if it is safe to start
      radiation with chemotherapy within 5 days after surgery. Usually patients start their
      radiation with chemotherapy about 21-28 days after the surgery.

      Shortening the total time of treatment may allow investigators to kill the cancer cells more
      effectively.

      Primary Objective To determine the safety and feasibility of reducing the time interval
      between LITT and the start of chemoradiation to ≤ 7 days.

      The primary endpoint (binary) for safety/feasibility will be defined as the occurrence of one
      or more of the following within each patient during a window of observation from the
      completion LITT to the end of radiation:

        -  Wound dehiscence, grade 3 {CTCAE v4.0)

        -  Seizures, grade 3 (CTCAE v4.0) in patients without a prior history of seizures and on
           adequate anti-seizure medications

        -  Cerebral edema, grade 4 (CTCAE v4.0)

        -  Failure to complete of 60 Grays (Gy) of radiation

      Secondary Objective(s) To estimate the proportion of patients requiring adjustments in
      radiation plans post-LITT.

      Secondary Endpoint: Requirement of an adjustment in the radiation plan to account for
      post-LITT tissue distortion.

      Study design This study will be a 2-stage, single-institution safety and feasibility trial.
      Patients will be evaluated by a neuro-oncology team consisting of a neurosurgeon trained in
      LITT, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist prior to surgery. Evaluable patients will
      have a histologic diagnosis of high-grade glioma, complete LITT, and are candidates for
      standard concurrent radiation (60 Gy) and temozolomide as determined by the treating
      physician. Concurrent chemoradiation will begin within 7 days of the LITT procedure.
