      Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a widespread and disabling syndrome. With this study
      the investigators want to evaluate the long term results of Stapled Transanal Rectal
      Resection (STARR) performed with Contour Transtar device in the treatment of ODS. A
      re-evaluation of 113 patients subjected to STARR from June 2007 to January 2010 was
      conducted.

    <description>The prolapsed tissue is pulled out through the CAD using e gauze pad and Allis forceps; this allows us to identify the extent of the prolapse to be resected. Four to five parachute stitches are then apposed circumferentially, like parachute cords, at the apex of the prolapse, in order to control the tissue during resection. The prolapse is then opened longitudinally at 3 o'clock with the electric scalpel between two Kocher clamps. Two traction stitches are applied at the deep vertex of the prolapse, one for each Kocher apex.
The longitudinal opening then allows the surgeon to begin circumferential resection of the rectum by pulling on the parachute stitches. This maneuver is performed counterclockwise using an average of 4-6 recharges, with care to always place the stapler at the base of the prolapse. The resected specimen was always inspected before the end of the procedure.</description>
