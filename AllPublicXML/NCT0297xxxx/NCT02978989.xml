      To determine the safety and feasibility of solo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is
      defined as the application of solo surgery to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, by comparing
      consecutive non-solo procedures conducted by a surgeon in the presence or absence of human
      assistant(s).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laporoscopic cholecystectomy usually requires three surgeons, including an operator, a camera
      assistant, and other instrument assistant. Recent advancement of technology made it possible
      to develop the conveniently adjustable holders for camera and other laparoscopic instruments.
      The application of these instruments enables &quot;solo-surgery&quot; wherein an operation is driven by
      single surgeon. During surgery, human assistant(s) are helpful because of their instant
      assistance according to the operation's need. Therefore, the utilization of instruments
      instead of human assistants would be cumbersome. However, the utilization of instruments
      would be helpful by enabling operation-driven repositioning of the camera and instrument(s).
      Currently, no attempt has been made to objectively compare the merits and demerits of these
      two procedures. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the safety and feasibility
      of solo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is defined as the application of solo surgery to
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy, by comparing consecutive non-solo procedures conducted by a
      surgeon in the presence or absence of human assistant(s).
