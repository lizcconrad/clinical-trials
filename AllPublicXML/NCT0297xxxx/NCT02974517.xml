  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the rapid development of human assisted reproductive technology (ART) has provided
      many help for couples with fertility issues. Even take baby home rate has been increased
      dramatically in the past several decades; both clinicians and embryologists are still
      struggling to improve pregnancy rates. Among all the strategies that the embryologists have
      tried, much work has been done to find better embryo culture conditions and embryo quality
      evaluation system. Currently, most centers in the world, including ours, are still using
      conventional incubators and manual embryo scoring system. This traditional method has several
      limitations, such as unstable environment during culture, and embryo scores can be different
      judged by different embryologists. EmbryoScope® by Vitrolife is a newly developed time-lapse
      embryo culture and analysis system. It is user-friendly, and suited for routinely daily use.
      In addition, its KID Score system can help embryologist select high quality embryos quickly,
      which leads to an overall increase in pregnancy outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles. The aim of this
      prospective cohort study is to evaluate the use of EmbryoScope® in our center.

      All patients included into this study are divided into three groups:

        1. Time-lapse-Auto: All embryos are cultured in EmbryoScope®; embryo scores are evaluated
           on day 3 by KID Score system.

        2. Time-lapse-Manual: All embryos are cultured in EmbryoScope®; embryo scores are evaluated
           on day 3 by embryologist.

        3. Conventional Group: All embryos are cultured in our daily used incubators; embryo scores
           are evaluated on day 3 by embryologist.

      The aim is to compare IVF/ICSI outcomes, such as pregnancy outcome, fertilization rate,
      cleavage rate, high quality embryo rate, blastocyst formation rate, among these three groups.
