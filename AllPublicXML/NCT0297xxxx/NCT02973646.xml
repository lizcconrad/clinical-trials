  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to observe the anti-HBV therapeutic effects of peginterferon alfa-2b in chronic
      hepatitis b patients with e antigen positive based on the detection of interferon gene
      mutation (IFNA2 p.Ala120Thr) and interferon receptor (IFNAR2) detection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with e antigen positive chronic hepatitis b were enrolled in the study. Age, sex,
      symptoms (e.g., fever, fatigue, poor appetite, jaundice) were recorded in the study. We also
      observed the laboratory test results including the levels of white blood cells (WBC), red
      blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelet (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate
      transaminase (AST), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg),
      hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA; detection of gene mutation
      (IFNA2 p.Ala120Thr), levels of interferon receptor (IFNAR2).
