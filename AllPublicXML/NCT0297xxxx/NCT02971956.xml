  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for advanced
      esophageal cancer.

      The study intervention involved in this study is:

      -Pembrolizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for the
      participant specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Pembrolizumab, also known as KEYTRUDA or MK-3475, is approved in the USA and several other
      countries to treat other types of diseases.

      The goal of this research study is to

      -Evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in participants with advanced esophageal
      cancer that have not responded to standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, measurable, unresectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the esophagus. For the purposes of this study, undifferentiated
             carcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas will be categorized as adenocarcinomas.

          -  The primary tumor must originate in the esophagus. Tumors that involve the GE junction
             must meet Sievert Type 1 criteria: &quot;Adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus which
             usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the oesophagus
             (i.e. Barrett's oesophagus) and which may infiltrate the oesophagogastric junction
             from above.&quot; For the purposes of this protocol, this will be interpreted as: greater
             than 50% of the tumor must be above the GE junction or, alternatively, the tumor must
             involve the GE junction and arise in the setting of biopsy-documented Barrett's
             esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia).

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease.
             Patients with recurrence within 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant
             therapy may be considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable
             disease.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have measurable disease based on irRECIST.

          -  Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained biopsy of a tumor lesion, most
             commonly an EGD biopsy from the esophagus. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen
             obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects
             for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject
             safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.
             Please note, patients may not initiate therapy until the biopsy specimen is received
             at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

          -  The first 15 patients with adenocarcinoma will be offered an optional tumor biopsy
             (typically EGD biopsy) at 8 weeks. Starting with adenocarcinoma patient #16, patients
             must have an accessible tumor and must agree to tumor biopsy at 8 weeks; this will
             continue to be mandatory until a total of 20 patients have undergone biopsy at 8
             weeks.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale (Appendix A).

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference
             Section 6.3.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined below, all screening labs should be
             performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.

             â‰¥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN (GFR can also
             be used in place of creatinine or CrCL) Creatinine clearance should be calculated per
             institutional standard.

             -Hepatic

          -  Serum total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin â‰¤ ULN for subjects with total
             bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN

          -  AST (SGOT) â‰¤ 2.5 X ULN OR â‰¤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. Subjects requiring systemic steroids are excluded from the trial. The use
             of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after discussion with the
             sponsor.

          -  Patients that require supplemental oxygen are excluded.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

             --Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
