  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and it is estimated up to 50% of
      patients do not respond to evidenced-based psychotherapy treatment, recording a 'stasis'
      outcome. However, there is limited research understanding this population, meaning a
      considerable number of people continue to suffer. The purpose of this study is to 1) identify
      depression stasis prevalence and predictors in an existing evidenced-based group treatment
      for depression, 2) run a clinical trial to test whether an embedded intervention based on
      theoretical and clinical practice evidence can help reduce patient depression stasis and
      drop-out rates and 3) understand what aspect of therapy produces change (or prevents change
      in stasis). The study will be based on behavioural activation (BA) therapy delivered in an
      eight-session group format in an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service
      in the United Kingdom. BA is one of the most effective psychotherapies available for
      depression and focuses on helping patients to increase their engagement with valued
      activities to help break out of the cycle of depression. Firstly, an archived anonymised
      dataset of routine depression measures from patients who have previously received the
      existing group BA treatment will be analysed. Secondly, the group BA treatment delivered to
      patients in 2017 will be enhanced with two treatment augmentations. One augmentation will
      target stasis outcomes through the addition of specific 'if-then' planning (known as
      implementation intentions) when setting between-session homework and the other augmentation
      will target patient drop-out by informing patients about group BA effectiveness and
      therapy-dose evidence. The stasis outcomes and drop-out rates from the enhanced treatment in
      the trial will be compared with the archived outcomes to see if the intervention has had an
      effect and the role of engaging in valued living as a mechanism of change for depression
      symptoms will be examined. It is hypothesised that a) 50% of patients who have received the
      existing BA group treatment for depression will have a stasis outcome, b) there will be a
      significant reduction in depression stasis outcomes and drop-out rate following the enhanced
      BA group treatment delivered in the trial and c) engagement in valued living will have a
      mediating effect on outcome for responding patients following the enhanced BA group treatment
      but the effect will not be present for patients with a stasis outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A one-armed quasi-experimental trial will be used to test the effect of two embedded
      behavioural activation group (BAG) treatment augmentations on treatment outcomes and to
      identify a potential outcome mediator for patients with a stasis outcome. A non-randomised
      design enables data to be collected which reflects routine clinical practice and address
      stasis outcomes as they occur in real-world services. A matched pairs design will be
      implemented in the analysis to allow comparison of the enhanced BAG data with historical
      control data from archived outcomes of the existing treatment (i.e. the baseline data).

      Patients who access the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service in
      Sheffield, United Kingdom with a primary presenting problem of depression and are referred to
      BAG will be approached to take part in the study. Patients will be asked to provide informed
      consent to agree for their weekly routine outcome scores from enhanced BAG to be used in the
      study.

      Enhanced BAG Augmentations

      The existing BAG treatment will be enhanced with embedded treatment augmentations. The
      augmentations will consist of two strands; 1) implementation intentions to directly target
      reducing stasis and 2) psychoeducation to target reducing drop-out.

      Implementation Intentions: The first augmentation will be a top-down theoretically informed
      'implementation intentions' enhancement to target reducing the stasis outcome rate.
      Implementation intentions are specific plans about how, when and where goals will be acted
      upon, formed using an if-then format in order to effectively implement actions. Patients will
      be taught to use if-then planning (implementation intentions) to help them complete the
      between-session which is crucial to producing change in BA.

      Dose-Response Psychoeducation: The second augmentation will be a dose-response
      psychoeducation enhancement aimed at reducing the dropout rate. Patients will be given
      information based on practice-based evidence about the effectiveness of BAG and dose-response
      information (minimum number of sessions required to experience change).

      Treatment Integrity

      Treatment adherence to the protocol will be assessed using a BAG adherence checklist created
      for this trial. Adherence will be checked and compared using self-report and an expert rater;
      i) after each session the BAG facilitators will complete the session integrity measure to
      check self-report adherence and ii) the BAG facilitator lead will observe and rate one
      session from each course of BAG to provide an expert adherence check.

      Data Collection

      Data collection for the study will run for a year from January 2017 until December 2017
      incorporating six BAG treatment groups.

      Data Analysis

      The data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The final available
      measure will be used as the post score or if there is only one score available, it will be
      assumed there was no change. Patients who do not score above the clinical cut-off for
      depression (score of â‰¥10 on Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) prior to commencing BAG
      will not be included in the analysis to avoid a floor effect when calculating stasis
      outcomes.

    <description>Behavioural activation (BA) is a psychotherapy intervention based on behaviour theory and operant conditioning. It teaches patients to reduce avoidant depressive behaviours and in turn increase the positive reinforcement they receive from their environment for non-depressive behaviours through the use of activity scheduling and pleasant events. For the trial, BA will be delivered in a group format (BAG) and facilitated by two therapists. BAG treatment will consist of eight weekly sessions, lasting two hours and will follow a manualised treatment protocol. Each session will be based on a different topic relevant to the principles of BA and patients will be given between session work to complete to encourage increased participation in rewarding personally meaningful activities.</description>
