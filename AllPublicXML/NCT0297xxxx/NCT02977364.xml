    <textblock>
      To investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of C-met Kinase Inhibitor HS-10241
      in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours that are not eligible for conventional or intensive
      treatment. The dose of HS-10241 will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HS-10241 in advanced cancer patients. At the
      same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of HS-10241 will be
      observed in advanced cancer patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase
      II.
