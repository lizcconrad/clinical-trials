  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 1.5 million HIV-infected women become pregnant each year. Approximately half have
      access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but all are at increased risk of preterm birth (PTB).
      Vaginal progesterone (VP) is a promising and cost-effective intervention to prevent PTB that
      should be studied in this high-risk population. This pilot study will provide critical
      insight into the feasibility of a phase III trial by determining whether women are willing to
      participate, to adhere to study drug, and to complete follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a mixed method study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a trial of
      VP to prevent PTB among HIV-infected Zambian women. To assess the feasibility of a full-scale
      clinical trial, the investigators will implement a pilot two-arm, double-masked,
      placebo-controlled trial of VP among HIV-infected women in antenatal care in Lusaka, Zambia.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either daily self-administered VP or
      indistinguishable placebo prior to 24 weeks gestational age. In this pilot study, the
      investigators will be able to estimate study uptake, adherence to study product and protocol,
      and study retention. To assess the acceptability of a trial to test VP among HIV-infected
      women in Zambia, the investigators will employ a qualitative approach of longitudinal
      semi-structured interviews among women agreeing to trial participation and one-time
      semi-structured interviews (SSIs) among those who decline to participate.
