      Objectives - To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program based on
      tele-rehabilitation in stroke survivors. The aim of the intervention is to improve the
      transition from rehabilitation units to community dwelling and facilitate involvement in life
      roles in the community.

      Working hypothesis - The tele-rehabilitation based program for stroke survivors will be
      effective in:

        1. Improving function in activities of daily living, participation in occupations and
           health related quality of life.

        2. Reducing the need for outpatient clinic and rehabilitation services.

        3. The intervention achievements will be maintained in 6 months follow-up

      Methodology - Participants: Stroke survivors will be selected from patients who are referred
      to the outpatient or home-based rehabilitation unit of Maccabi health services. The
      participants will be randomly assigned into two groups: The treatment group (N=30) will
      receive the intervention program in addition to standard care, and control group- standard
      care only.

      Outcome measures:

        1. Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4)

        2. Stroke impact Scale (SIS)

        3. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)

        4. A 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12)

        5. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale short version

      Procedure: The intervention program includes 20 video chat sessions over 10 weeks between an
      occupational therapist and the participant, in the presence of the primary care giver. The
      virtual meetings will be conducted using The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational
      Performance approach. The meetings will focus on problem solving for daily life situations
      and on the ability to implement the discussed strategies for a variety of activities.
      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the intervention, and after 6 months.
