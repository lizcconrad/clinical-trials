  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fracture is very common which is often combined with deltoid ligament injury. Although
      the incidence of deltoid ligament injury is high, but there is no unified and effective
      diagnosis method. Even whether the ankle fracture with deltoid ligament rupture needs
      surgical repair is still controversial. There is no high-level, multi-center, large sample,
      long-term follow-up clinical evidence to prove whether the repair of deltoid ligament is
      necessary or not. The main content of the project: 1 Achieve accurate classification of
      deltoid ligament rupture with intraoperative exploration. 2 Study the surgical indications
      and treatment guidelines by comparative study.
