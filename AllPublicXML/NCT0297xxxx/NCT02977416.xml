  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During exercise, energy comes mainly from carbohydrates and lipids. The relative contribution
      of lipids and glucose as energy substrates to exercise depends on the parameters of the
      exercise (duration, intensity and level of training) and the physiological conditions of the
      subject.

      Inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are treated, for the most
      severe forms, by biotherapies. These treatments target certain pro-inflammatory cytokines
      including TNFα. In adults with rheumatoid arthritis several studies have shown that treatment
      with anti-TNFα increases insulin sensitivity. There is no data on the oxidation of energy
      substrates during exercise in children and adolescents with AJI, nor on the impact of
      anti-TNFα treatments on the oxidation of energetic substrates in children.

      Investigators hypothesize that, compared to healthy children, children with JIA should
      exhibit altered oxidation of energy substrates at rest and submaximal physical exercise due
      to physical deconditioning and inflammation. In addition, those treated with anti-TNFα should
      have an oxidation profile of energy substrates at exercise different from that of patients
      not treated with anti-TNFα. Investigators also hypothesize that anti-TNFα treatments modify
      the contribution of energy chains (aerobic, anaerobic and anaerobic alactic) during the
      exercise.
