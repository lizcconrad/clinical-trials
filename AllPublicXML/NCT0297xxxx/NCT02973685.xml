      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion
      chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with
      large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of
      TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B especially for those
      with tumor larger than 10 cm. Our previous prospective study also revealed similar results of
      large HCC patients treated with TACE. Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study
      suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve
      the survivals for HCC with large HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective
      randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of HAIC over TACE.

    <description>A standard hepatic artery catheter was introduced via the femoral artery percutaneously. Selective catheterization of the proper hepatic artery was performed using standard diagnostic catheters and fluoroscopic guidance. In the event of multiple arterial supply(including superior-mesenteric artery), the proportion of the liver supplied by each artery was estimated by the arteriogram. After optimal positioning of the catheter in dominant supplying artery to ensure minimal reflux, the catheter was fixed and connected with infusion tube. In the condition of multiple tumors on both left and right lobe, the gastroduodenal artery was embolized and the catheter was positioned in the hepatic proper artery for infusion. Folfox Protocol were infused through the fixed catheter sequentially.</description>
