  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled clinical study
      over a total of 4-week therapy with DLBS1033 in the management of STE-ACS after a primary
      PCI. There will be 40 STE-ACS subjects (20 subjects in each group) planned to complete the
      study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STE-ACS patients who undergo intermediate-delayed (&gt; 3 hours after the onset of the STEMI)
      primary PCI will be enrolled in the study. Before the intervention, they will be given
      standard medication for PCI.

      Right after PCI, all eligible subjects will be assessed for microvascular perfusion, using a
      pressure-temperature sensor-tipped coronary guidewire.

      The day after, in addition to the dual antiplatelet therapy, i.e. 80 mg aspirin once daily
      and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily or its
      placebo will be given to the subjects for 4 weeks.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and
      safety will be performed at Baseline (right after subjects undergo the primary PCI) and at
      the End of study (week 4th of DLBS1033 therapy).
