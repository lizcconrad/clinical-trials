  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The growing awareness on the health burden generated by insufficient levels of
      physical activity has prompted the interest for deploying community-based initiatives aiming
      at fostering active healthy living. It is of note, however, that, to our knowledge, none of
      the interventions evaluated so far have reached large scale adoption. The current protocol
      relies on the general hypothesis that properly tailored self-management programs, fully
      integrated in the patient's action plan with remote off-line professional support, may induce
      sustained behavioral changes resulting in exercise health behavior. Accordingly, the current
      manuscript addresses those unmet requirements, namely: i) Workflow design of the PA services
      engaging both patients and health professionals; ii) Enhanced information and communication
      technologies (ICT)-support; iii) Evaluation strategies including structured indicators; and,
      iv) Implementation of innovative business models. The main outcome of the current protocol
      will be a roadmap for large scale deployment and assessment of novel collaborative
      self-management PA services in the region of Catalonia (7.5 million citizens).

      Methods: The protocol has been designed as part of the regional deployment of integrated care
      services in Catalonia (2016-2020). It has been conceived has a two-year (2017-2018) test bed
      period.

      Aims: The protocol uses a population-health approach to addresses the four aims: i)
      Prehabilitation for high risk candidates to major surgery; ii) Community-based rehabilitation
      for clinical stable chronic patients with moderate to severe disease; and, iii) Promotion of
      physical activity and healthy lifestyles for citizens at risk and patients with mild disease.

    <description>Case identification: Candidates fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be identified by the anesthesiologist.
Case evaluation: Candidates will be assessed to identify the overall needs and perform a baseline evaluation.
Personalized Work plan definition: Personalization of the plan involves a calendar and planning of face to face visits and remote contacts; intensity of the supervised exercise training program; threshold of steps per day; nutritional intervention; psychological intervention; and integration of the intervention into the overall work plan.
Work plan execution &amp; 5-Follow-up+event handling: Involve the follow-up tasks, including non-scheduled interactions through the personal health folder (PHF)
6-Discharge: Patient will be discharged from prehabilitation and moved to rehabilitation.</description>

    <description>Case identification: Candidates fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be identified by the general practitioner.
Case evaluation: The primary care team will characterize the candidates, covering: i) patient requirements defining the work plan; ii) aerobic capacity and physical activity; iii) identification of factors modulating adherence.
Personalized work plan definition: The community-based intervention will include reassessment of the patient's work plan aiming at optimization of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. Consist of a motivational interview and a physical activity (PA) intervention (6-month duration) based on supervised endurance training, promotion of PA and empowerment for self-management using the PHF.
Work plan execution &amp; 5-Follow-up+event handling: The ICT-support will facilitate the program follow up.
6-Discharge: The patient will be discharged or moved to the PA service addressed to citizens at risk &amp; patients with mild disease.</description>

    <description>Case identification: Candidates fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be identified by the GP.
Case evaluation: i) patient requirements defining the work plan; ii) aerobic capacity and PA; iii) identification of factors modulating adherence.
Personalized work plan definition: i) motivational interview; ii) training for the use of the PHF for self-management; and iii) assign one case manager for off-line remote surveillance. The following optional modules are envisaged: i) basic service (above); ii) endurance training programs; iii) community physical activity group sessions; and/or, iv) upgraded PA program including sensors and close off-line supervision.
Work plan execution &amp; 5-Follow-up+event handling: The ICT-support will facilitate the program follow up.
6-Discharge: The basic version of the promotion of PA program is conceived for a timeless duration. However, the different modules included in the service portfolio will have specific agendas and associated costs.</description>
