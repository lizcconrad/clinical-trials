  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder which is accompanied by an enormous individual and
      societal burden. Despite established efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis
      (CBTp), its dissemination into routine mental health care remains poor. National regulations
      such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline in the United
      Kingdom recommend that CBTp should be offered to every person with psychotic symptoms, but
      more than 50% do not receive even a single session of CBTp. In Germany, CBTp is virtually not
      represented in the psychotherapy health service. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) in a self-help format has been proven feasible and effective in anxiety and depressive
      disorders. Recently, Internet-based (self-help) interventions are also deployed via
      smartphone apps. The feasibility of Internet-based treatments for people with schizophrenia
      is well documented for Internet-based interventions (e.g., medication management) and also
      reported for smartphone interventions. However, there is a dearth of empirical studies
      precluding a conclusive picture. As far as the investigators know, there is only one study
      encompassing 90 participants with psychosis that investigated an Internet-based intervention
      with symptom-specific, cognitive behavioral interventions, which is from the investigators'
      research group. The unique features of the proposed project are 1) the first-time evaluation
      of a symptom-oriented, CBTp-based self-help treatment for people with psychotic symptoms via
      Internet, enhanced with smartphone assistance. The study is set up as randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) with active treatment versus a wait-list control group. It evaluates a combined
      Internet-based guided self-help treatment for persecutory ideation and auditory verbal
      hallucinations. The active treatment condition consists of access to a self-help website
      including regular written electronic contact with a guide and access to smartphone-based
      interactive worksheets (apps). The trials combine the low-threshold advantages of an online
      approach (e.g., anonymity) with the virtues of a clinical trial (e.g., symptom assessment and
      diagnostic verification via Interview). The primary outcome measure is the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures include self-reported symptom
      measures (Paranoia Checklist; Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire revised), completion rates,
      drop-out from the intervention, general symptomatology, side-effects, and client
      satisfaction. The project will help to answer the empirical question whether CBTp-based
      interventions in a purely Internet-based self-help format are effective. Positive findings
      would pave the way for an easy-to-access treatment option for patients with psychotic
      symptoms who currently are deprived of psychotherapeutic treatment.
