  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this study will show that sufficient lymphocyte stem cell
      can be harvested prior chemoradiation and be reinfused back after treatment, and at least 5
      of the 10 patients (50%) will achieve an absolute increase of lymphocyte counts of 300
      cells/mm^3 four weeks after stem cell reinfusion in high grade glioma patients.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

               -  Hematocrit ≥ 30%

             (including immunotoxins, immunoconjugates, antisense, peptide receptor antagonists,
             interferons, interleukins, TIL, LAK, or gene therapy), or hormonal therapy.
             Glucocorticoid therapy is allowed.

          -  Anti-VEGF therapy within 6 weeks of registration.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or

             receiving Novocure are allowed on study.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to filgrastim or plerixafor or other agents used in the study.

          -  Fresh CNS bleed as evident by MRI or CT.

          -  Contraindicated for anticoagulation.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.
