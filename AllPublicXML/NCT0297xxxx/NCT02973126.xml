    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the AFFECTS Study is to assess agreement between SPECT and FFRct in
      identifying vessel-specific, hemodynamically significant CAD in patients scheduled for
      invasive coronary angiography (ICA) based on abnormal SPECT myocardial perfusion scans. In
      particular, the study will evaluate the ability of FFRct to correctly rule out
      hemodynamically significant CAD in patients with non-significant CAD or normal coronary
      arteries who had positive SPECT scans.
