      To investigate the effects of whole body vibration on postural control and on the level of
      satisfaction regarding how to reach the goals of the patients with ataxia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, group 1 will take only exercise therapy,
      group 2 will take exercise therapy and whole body vibration together. After 1 week wash-out
      period, patients assigned other therapy period. All assessments will be repeated before and
      after each therapy period. Exercise therapy will consist of selected balance, coordination
      and walking exercises according to the individual needs of patients. Whole body vibration
      (20-30 Hz, minimum amplitude) will be applied to cases in the form of 4 sets (1 min
      application and 1min rest.) Cases will take the treatment 1-hour, 3 days in a week for 8
      weeks.

      The evaluation parameters consists of demographic information, Computerized Dynamic
      Posturography, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Trunk Impairment Scale, Berg
      Balance Scale, Barthel Index and Goal Assessment Scale.

    <measure>Sensory organization test of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in sensory component of postural control at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) is a unique assessment technique used to objectively quantify and differentiate among the wide variety of possible sensory, motor, and central adaptive impairments to balance control. CDP has severeal test protocols; a Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Limits of Stability Test (LOS), a Motor Control Test (MCT) and an Adaptation Test (ADT) used in the study. Sensory organization test (SOT) evaluates the relative contributions of vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems to balance maintenance when somatosensory information regarding the orientation of the body's centre of gravity is systematically manipulated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in severity of ataxic symptoms at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ICARS was developed to quantify the level of impairment as a result of ataxia as related to hereditary ataxias. Disorders rated as subscales within the ICARS are: Postural and gait disturbances, Limb Ataxia, Dysarthria and Oculomotor disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in impairment of trunk at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the motor impairment of the trunk through the evaluation of static and dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement. Three subscales: static sitting, balance, dynamic sitting balance and coordination. Each subscale has between three and 10 items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in balance performance at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item objective measure designed to assess static balance and fall risk. Static and dynamic activities of varying difficulty are performed.Item-level scores range from 0-4, determined by ability to perform the assessed activity. Item scores are summed.Maximum score is 56.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in performance of activitiesof daily living (ADL) at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel includes 10 personal activities. Clinically, the Barthel can be administered via interview, by observation of the patient's performance in a specific setting, or by asking the patient to demonstrate an activity.The response categories of disability in an activity were defined and rated in scale steps (0, 5), (0, 5, 10), (0, 5, 10, 15) dependent on the item. For example, for performance of dressing activity, 0 means dependent, 5 means patient needs help but can do about half unaided, 10 means independent (including buttons, zips, laces, etc.) An overall score is formed by adding scores on each rating. Scores range from 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (fully independent), in steps of 5, with higher scores indicating greater independence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in satisfaction regarding how to reach the goals related therapy at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) is an individualized outcome measure involving goal selection and goal scaling that is standardized in order to calculated the extent to which a patient's goals are met. Each patient effectively has their own outcome measure, but these measures are scored in a standardized way. &quot;Successful&quot; outcomes are agreed upon prior to intervention. Scoring: Each goal is rated on a 5-point scale. 0 = Patient achieves the expected level; +1 = somewhat more than expected; +2 = much more than expected; -1 = somewhat less than expected; -2 = much less than expected. Overall score is calculated by incorporating the goal outcome scores into a single aggregated T-score. (Optional): Goals may be weighted by the patient for importance or difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Limits of stability test of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in dynamic balance component of postural control at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Limits of stability test (LOS) assesses dynamic balance during the performance of specific tasks with visual feedback. It quantifies objectively the maximum distance a person can lean in a given direction without losing balance, stepping or reaching for assistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Control Test of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in automatic motor system component of postural control at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Control Test (MCT) assesses the ability of the automatic motor system to quickly recover following an unexpected external disturbance. Sequences of platform translations of varied sizes in forward and backward directions elicit automatic postural responses. The size of the translation is scaled to the patient's height to produce sway disturbances of equal size.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adaptation Test of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in postural sway in changes of support surface component of postural control at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adaptation Test (ADT) assesses the patient's ability to minimize sway when exposed to irregularities and unexpected changes in support surface properties. Sequences of platform rotations in the toes-up or toes-down direction elicit automatic motor responses.</description>
