  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cediranib maleate and olaparib work compared
      to bevacizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Cediranib maleate
      and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the antitumor activity of cediranib maleate (cediranib)/olaparib versus
      reference bevacizumab monotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months
      (PF6), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS), and objective response (ORR) in patients with recurrent
      GBM treated with cediranib/olaparib versus bevacizumab.

      II. To assess the safety of the combination of olaparib and cediranib in patients with
      recurrent GBM.

      III. To evaluate the association of blood based biomarkers involved with angiogenesis using
      the Biomarker Review Committee-approved Plasma Angiome Panel (bFGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-2,
      SDF1-alpha, Collagen IV, PlGF, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, VEGF, Il-1beta, Il-6, Il-8, TNF-alpha, CAIX)
      with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib.

      IV. To evaluate the association of tissue biomarkers involved with deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) repair using the Biomarker Review Committee-approved BROCA panel with the clinical
      activity of cediranib/olaparib.

      V. To identify genomic alteration by whole exome sequencing in GBM tumor specimens that
      correlate with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib.

      VI. To evaluate the association of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging parameters (tumor perfusion and oxygenation, brain tumor
      cellularity) with the biological response of cediranib/olaparib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib maleate PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM B: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then
      periodically for 3 years.
