  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a high protein, high fiber
      supplement pre-load on energy intake at a subsequent meal compared to a low fiber, high
      carbohydrate Control product in healthy overweight and obese subjects. The investigators
      hypothesize the high protein, high fiber pre-load will result in reduced energy intake at a
      subsequent meal compared to low protein, low fiber.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy intake (total kilocalories) at meal subsequent to intervention pre-load</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will consume an ad-libitum pizza meal for 30 minutes, 30 minutes following ingestion of the pre-load intervention. At the end of the 30 minute pizza meal, total caloric intake will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Appetite Questionnaire on scale of 0-100</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention; 10, 20, 30, 60 min post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A standard VAS Appetite questionnaire will be completed by subjects before pre-load intervention, and at indicated time intervals. The 4 questions assess hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption. Each of the questions on the VAS is a 100 mm line anchored at each end with opposing statements. Participants mark a vertical line on the line at a point that they felt reflect their feelings at the moment the test was taken. Scores will be assessed by measuring the distance between the intersection of the vertical line with the line and the left end of the line.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Cravings Questionnaire on scale of 0-100</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention; 10, 20, 30, 60 min post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A standard VAS Cravings questionnaire will be completed by subjects before pre-load intervention, and at indicated time intervals. The 4 questions assess cravings for sweet, salty, savory, and fatty. Each of the questions on the VAS is a 100 mm line anchored at each end with opposing statements. Participants mark a vertical line on the line at a point that they felt reflect their feelings at the moment the test was taken. Scores will be assessed by measuring the distance between the intersection of the vertical line with the line and the left end of the line.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Physical Comfort Questionnaire on scale of 0-100</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention; immediately post-intervention; 30 min post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses Gastrointestinal symptoms including Bloating, Belching, Nausea, Diarrhea, and Flatulence. Participants identify if they are currently experiencing the symptom (Yes/No) and if yes, rate the severity of the symptom (Low to High) on a 100 mm scale (0-100). Measures will be made from the left side of the scale, similar to Appetite and Cravings questionnaires.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, 18-50 years of age, inclusive

          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 27 and 33 kg/mÂ² inclusive at screening.

          3. Blood pressure &lt; 130/85.

          4. Willing to maintain habitual diet, physical activity pattern, and body weight
             throughout the trial.

          5. Willing to abstain from strenuous exercise, consumption of alcoholic drinks and
             caffeine-containing food/drinks 24 hours before study days and during study days
             (until study completion for that day).

          6. Willing to maintain current dietary supplement (if applicable) use throughout the
             trial. On test days, subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until
             dismissal from the GI labs. Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.

          7. Absence of health conditions that would prevent fulfillment of study requirements as
             judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.

          8. Understanding the study procedures and willing to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health
             information to the study investigator.

          9. Female subjects are willing to use a contraceptive method to avoid pregnancy during
             the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit, or with any condition which
             might, in the opinion of Dr. Wolever, the president of GI labs, either: 1) make
             participation dangerous to the subject or to others, or 2) affect the results.

          5. Major trauma or surgical event within 3 months of screening.

             antibiotic therapy) has been completed at least 5 d prior to each test visit.

         11. History of cancer in the prior two years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer.

         12. Exposure to any non-registered drug product within 30 d prior to screening.
