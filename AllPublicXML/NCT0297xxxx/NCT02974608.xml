      Background:

      Malaria is a serious disease. It is passed by infected mosquitoes. In many parts of Africa,
      malaria continues to be the main cause of death in young children and pregnant women.
      Researchers want to find out more about how malaria affects pregnant women and their babies.

      Objectives:

      To study the rate of miscarriage and stillbirth during the second and third trimesters among
      women in a certain district in Mali. To study rates of malaria infection over time among
      pregnant women and children in this area.

      Eligibility:

      Pregnant women of any age and pregnancy stage and their newborns. They must live in
      Ouelessebougou, Mali. Children up to 10 years old who live there.

      Design:

      Information about the study will be shared at community meetings, during visits to the health
      centers, and during census updates.

      Participants will read and sign a consent form.

      Pregnant women will be screened to see if they are eligible. They may have a urine test. They
      may have an ultrasound to date their pregnancy. Ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures
      of the body.

      Women will be enrolled in the study after they have their babies.

      Participants may have a physical exam.

      Some participants will provide a finger/heel prick blood sample.

      Participants will complete a questionnaire. They will be asked about:

      Medical history

      Antimalarial and other interventions

      Socioeconomic status

      Their pregnancy

      Previous pregnancies

      Health of their newborn...

      Placental malaria (PM) leads to poor outcomes for pregnant women and their babies, and is
      caused by Plasmodium falciparum sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta and
      ensuing inflammation. Severe maternal anemia, low birth weight (LBW) delivery and fetal loss
      are common sequelae. Malaria-related LBW alone is estimated to cause 62,000-363,000 infant
      deaths in Africa each year. To reduce poor pregnancy outcomes associated with malaria
      infection, WHO recommends monthly anti-malarial treatment with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP)
      during the second and third trimester and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets. However,
      in East and Southern Africa, SP has lost its efficacy due to the spread of drug-resistant
      parasites.

      Therefore, an effective vaccine for PM is needed. Although the ideal vaccine will be given to
      adolescent girls prior to becoming pregnant, at this early stage of pregnancy malaria vaccine
      development, it is unknown if a boosting dose may be needed during pregnancy. Before testing
      new interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes, it is important to obtain baseline
      information on pregnancy outcomes in the target population. In our recent longitudinal study
      of 1,885 pregnant women in Mali, in which women were closely followed during pregnancy
      (including malaria prevention and treatment), 2.9%, 2.4% and 6% of pregnancies ended in
      miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm delivery, respectively.

      The primary goal of the study is to assess pregnancy outcomes in women in the community with
      access to the WHO recommended standard of care. All women presenting for an antenatal visit
      at Ouelessebougou health centers will be recruited into the study. Pregnancy outcome
      information will be collected after the birth of the child or after pregnancy termination
      (i.e. miscarriage/stillbirth). Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed using
      appropriate statistical methods, including possible confounders, to determine the prevalence
      and factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.
