  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a population-based study using health administrative data to
      evaluate the impact of preoperative geriatric consultation on postoperative outcomes in older
      patients having elective, non-cardiac surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use multilevel multivariable analyses to measure the association
      between preoperative geriatric assessment or consultation and outcomes after major elective
      non-cardiac surgery. Sensitivity analyses will be done to evaluate types and timing of
      geriatric care around surgery, as well as for effect modification based on patient and
      procedural factors.

    <description>A preoperative geriatric consult or assessment will be considered to be present if such a consult or assessment is billed by a geriatrician for a patient in the cohort within 4 months preceding surgery. For the primary analysis we will collapse both geriatric consultations and comprehensive geriatric assessments into a single exposure level.</description>
