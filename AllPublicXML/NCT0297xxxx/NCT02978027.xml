  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NIAAA estimates that 16% (40 million) of adults in the US are drinking at unsafe levels.
      More than 50% of alcohol health consequences occur in risky, non-dependent drinkers.
      Increasing the efficacy and efficiency of brief interventions in medical setting could
      significantly reduce the public health impacts of risky drinking. There is intense interest
      in conducting motivational interviewing (MI) informed brief interventions for risky alcohol
      use in medical settings, but little empirical information is available regarding which MI
      behavioral and interpersonal style components drive effectiveness. The field would benefit
      greatly from empirically-based Stage 1 treatment development and modeling studies to
      delineate the degree to which adding motivational interviewing components to brief
      intervention improves outcome.

      The NIAAA estimates that 16% (40 million) of adults in the US are drinking at unsafe levels,
      placing them at risk for a variety of physical, mental health, and social consequences. More
      than 50% of alcohol health consequences occur in risky, non-dependent drinkers. Increasing
      the efficacy and efficiency of brief interventions in medical setting could significantly
      reduce the public health impacts of risky drinking. Despite overall positive findings for
      brief interventions, there are high levels of variability in effects, with meta-analyses
      reporting significant unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes that is likely accounted for by
      differences in intervention components and strategies. There is intense interest in
      conducting motivational interviewing (MI) informed brief interventions for risky alcohol use
      in medical settings, but little empirical information is available regarding which MI
      behavioral and interpersonal style components drive effectiveness.

      Following promising efficacy trials from counseling applications, MI was translated into
      brief (5-15 minute) interactions and subjected to randomized controlled trial methodology.
      Lack of mixed-methods, Stage 1 treatment development is evidenced by our inability to provide
      consistent delineation of key intervention components and mechanisms of action. Variability
      in these factors is likely responsible for the wide variability in effects observed in
      meta-analyses of brief interventions. Many MI skills and behaviors require significant
      training and supervision and increased patient-provider interaction time. The field would
      benefit greatly from empirically-based Stage 1 treatment development and modeling studies to
      delineate the degree to which adding motivational interviewing components to brief
      intervention improves outcome.

    <description>The brief advice protocol was designed by removing MI-consistent elements from the NIAAA Clinician's Guide. The protocol involves screening and assessment using the NIAAA pre-screen and single-question screen and assessing for quantity and frequency. Patients exceeding recommended limits receive feedback, information, and advice to cut down drinking to recommended levels. All patients are provided with a tip sheet on strategies for cutting down and encouraged to follow-up with a behavioral health provider with any questions or concerns.</description>

    <description>The NIAAA brief intervention was adapted directly from the NIAAA publication &quot;Helping Patients Who Drink Too Much: A Clinician's Guide&quot;. The protocol screens using the NIAAA pre-screen and single-questions. Patients exceeding recommended limits receive feedback, information, and advice to cut down. For patients unwilling to make a change, the clinician restates their concern, encourages self reflection by asking the patient about reasons to cut down on drinking and barriers to change, and reaffirms willingness to help. For patients willing to make a change, the clinician helps the patient develop a plan to cut down within maximum limits, agree on specific steps and strategies, and provides a tip sheet on strategies for cutting down.</description>

    <description>The MI intervention condition was also adapted from the NIAAA Clinician's Guide, with additional modification to include elements of MI. Clinicians normalize Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) and ask the patient's permission before discussing alcohol use. The NIAAA pre-screen and single-question screen are administered. Assessment of quantity, frequency, and Alcohol Use Disorder symptoms is done using open questions. The ask-tell-ask technique is used to share feedback and exchange information regarding U.S adult drinking patterns. For patients low in readiness to make a change, clinicians build readiness using structured MI tools. For patients high in readiness to change, the ask-tell-ask technique is used to explore strategies for cutting down and develop an action plan.</description>
