  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes of intraocular cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will be
      measured in recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) during treatment of
      ranibizumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PCV is regarded as a subtype of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), but has several
      different features such as polypoidal terminal of new vessels, and relative resistance to
      anti-VEGF treatment. Other cytokines then VEGF are thought to be associated with development
      and progression of the disease. The aim of the this study is to investigate intraocular
      cytokines related to recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Aqueous humor will be
      sampled from the anterior chamber at baseline, after loading injections of ranibizumab and at
      recurrence. The concentration of various cytokines will be measured in the aqueous humor.

    <description>Visual acuity is assessed using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The ETDRS chart includes 100 letters as the maximum possible score, and 0 letters read as the minimum possible score. Visual acuity of 85 letters is equivalent to 20/20. Higher score represents better functioning. The correlation is assessed using non-parametric analysis, or Spearman's ranked correlation.</description>

    <description>CSMT is central 1mm thickness of the macula measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Normal thickness is around 250μm. Increased CSMT is regarded as increase of en exudative sign. The correlation is assessed using non-parametric analysis, or Spearman's ranked correlation.</description>

    <description>Choroidal thickness is thickness of the choroid measured at the foveal center using spectral-domain OCT. Increased choroidal thickness was reported to be related to poor response to anti-VEGF treatment.

    <description>Ranibizumab 0.5mg is injected in to the vitreous cavity. An injection is given every 4 weeks three times, and then the patient will be followed up every 4 weeks. An addition injection is given as needed. Recurrence is defined as increase of exudative changes, or increase of 10% or more in central subfield macular thickness (CSMT) measured using optical coherence tomography. Aqueous humor is sampled from the anterior chamber before injection at baseline, 8 weeks and 20 weeks.</description>
