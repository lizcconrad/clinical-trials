      After a structured teaching program anaesthetists are educated in identifying the
      cricothyroid membrane with ultrasonography. Thereafter their ability to do so is compared
      with their ability to do so with palpation.

      The purpose is to advise a propriety method for preanesthetic identification. In an obese

The intervention is to mark the cricothyroid membrane in order to know exactly where it is in case that it should be needed fur emergency cricothyrotomy. The doctors mark the cricothyroid membrane with a pen after using palpation for identification.</description>
