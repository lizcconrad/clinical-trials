  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if fixed dose heparin infusions at a rate of 500
      units/hour are sufficient to maintain a target anti-Xa of 0.1-0.35 IU/mL for VTE prophylaxis
      in patients undergoing microvascular surgery. Additionally, a pilot protocol has been
      developed to titrate these heparin infusions to ensure patients have sufficient VTE
      prophylaxis. All patients will be enrolled in the observational arm of the study and receive
      anti-Xa level monitoring. Patients with out-of-range anti-Xa levels will cross over to the
      interventional arm of the study and receive real time heparin infusion dose adjustments per
      the pilot protocol. The primary outcome measured will be the percentage of patients with
      anti-Xa levels in the target range of 0.1-0.35 IU/mL while on a heparin infusion at 500
      units/hour.

    <description>The investigators will identify surgical patients placed on fixed dose heparin infusions at their attending surgeon's discretion-the proposed research will not dictate the initiation of the heparin drip intraoperatively. However, the investigators will identify patients already on heparin, evaluate steady state heparin anti-Xa levels and adjust patient's dose if necessary based on steady state anti-Xa levels. Eligible patients will be started on heparin fixed-dose intraoperatively. Steady state anti-Xa levels will be drawn at least 6 hours after initiation of heparin infusion. Goal anti-Xa levels will be 0.1-0.35 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>Patients with identified out of range levels will receive pharmacist-driven real time heparin dose adjustment and will receive follow-up steady state anti-Xa levels. Anti-Xa level monitoring will be discontinued when in range peak levels are obtained, when heparin infusions are discontinued at surgeon discretion, or when the patient is discharged.</description>
