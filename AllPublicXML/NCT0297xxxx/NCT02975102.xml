  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this investigation are to show that the performance of CBL-101 Eye
      Drops is non-inferior to that of Vismed® Multi eye drops in subjects with moderate to severe
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca after 28 days, and to assess the safety of CBL-101 Eye Drops
      during a 90-day period with treatment administered 3 to 6 times per day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration will be approximately 15 weeks from screening to the last visit. Subjects will
      visit the clinic approximately 5 times.
