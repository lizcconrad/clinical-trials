  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly administered as the sole treatment of brain
      metastases, in order to spare acute and long term side effects associated with whole brain
      radiotherapy. Local control of SRS treated lesions is good, but patients tend to develop
      additional brain metastases subsequently.

      Nivolumab is a modulator of the immune system. Treatment with Nivolumab is associated with an
      increase in local control and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma. In the presence of Nivolumab, treatment of brain metastases with
      SRS may trigger an immune reaction against cancer. Therefore, the combination of SRS with
      Nivolumab may reduce the development of new brain metastases and improve patient survival.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of combining Nivolumab and SRS in
      controlling cancer progression. SRS will be administered to patients while they are receiving
      Nivolumab.
