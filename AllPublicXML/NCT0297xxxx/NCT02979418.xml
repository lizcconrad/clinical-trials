  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement the validated household-level water insecurity scale developed by
      study investigators among a cohort of postpartum women in Nyanza, Kenya and will assess a
      range of outcomes linked to water insecurity, such as viral load, hydration status, maternal
      depression, stress, food insecurity, and cognitive development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop the first well-known household water insecurity scale. Currently,
      water insecurity cannot be measured at the level of the household or individual, i.e. at the
      endpoint of water use. Although there are myriad national, regional, community, and
      hydrological indexes of water availability, to the investigators' knowledge, there is no way
      of measuring water access at the household or individual levels. Without a comprehensive,
      validated scale to measure household water insecurity, the scientific, programmatic, and
      public health communities cannot empirically test the prevalence of household water
      insecurity access and its potential impacts on economic, nutrition, disease, and psychosocial
      health pathways and outcomes.
