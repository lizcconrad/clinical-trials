    <textblock>
      The trial is a single arm, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial which is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR011 in treatment of refractory DLBCL

    <textblock>
      The 3x3 dose escalation design will be adopted in order to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). Subjects will be enrolled into low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose
      group as below:

      Dose CAR+ cells/kg

      Low 0.8×106

      Medium 2.5×106

      High 5.0×106

      DLT is evaluated within 30 days post C-CAR011 infusion).
