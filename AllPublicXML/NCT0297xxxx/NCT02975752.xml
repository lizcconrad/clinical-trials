  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First-line treatment with afatinib prolongs overall survival in patients with metastatic
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. Conversely,
      somatic KRAS mutations are negative predictors for benefit from EGFR-targeting agents. In
      this study we want to compare a new highly sensitive method for the detection of EGFRdelEx19
      and KRAS Exon 2 with targeted-resequencing multiplex-PCR (NGS).

    <textblock>
      First-line treatment with afatinib prolongs overall survival in patients with metastatic
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. Conversely,
      somatic KRAS mutations are negative predictors for benefit from EGFR-targeting agents. Rapid
      availability of these biomarker results is mandatory to prevent delayed or inferior
      treatments.

      Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is
      well-established for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. Next generation sequencing (NGS) via
      targeted resequencing allows simultaneous interrogation for multiple mutations, but has its
      limitations based on the amount of tumor tissue required and assay times. RT-PCR using
      Light-Cycler technology (LC-RTPCR) is a rapid and sensitive assay to detect somatic mutations
      in various tissues from NSCLC patients. The study's aim was to analyze if LC-RTPCR is
      feasible for rapid EGFRdelEx19 and KRAS Exon 2 mutation detection in EBUS-TBNA samples and to
      compare results with results obtained via standard NGS mutation analyses.
