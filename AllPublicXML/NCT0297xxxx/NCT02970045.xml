    <textblock>
      This research trial collects biological samples and clinical information to create a
      repository of data from patients with cancer or a predisposition for cancer. Combining
      genetic information from biological samples and clinical data may lead to more knowledge
      about why certain cancers respond to treatment and help create more personalized medicine.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a longitudinal study of clinical and related data from patients with or at
      risk for cancer.

      II. To establish a large biospecimen repository that is linked to clinical and related data.

      III. To follow patients through their lifetime though passive or active follow-up.

      IV. To use clinical data, tissues, other biological samples and derived molecular data in the
      Total Cancer Care Protocol (TCCP) repositories to match patients in this TCCP study to future
      studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood during a regular care visit or not up to 4 times a year.
      Extra tissue is collected after removal during standard of care surgery and patients may
      undergo additional tumor sampling (needle passes) at the time of planned diagnostic biopsies.
      During bone marrow biopsy, the doctor may reposition the needle up to 3 times, and bone
      marrow for research will not be collected more than 4 times per year. Patients may undergo
      additional collection of other biological samples such as saliva, sputum, urine, feces, hair,
      and surface skin swabs for analysis. Patients also receive surveys or questionnaires to
      collect demographics, medical, family, and nutritional history, cancer predisposing risk
      factors, quality of life data, and quality of care data.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
