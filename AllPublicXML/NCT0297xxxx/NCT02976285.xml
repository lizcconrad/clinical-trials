    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the impact and potential advantage of a novel
      synthetic patch augmentation in repair of massive rotator cuff (RC) tears, using clinical and
      radiological approaches. The investigators hypothesized that implanting this patch will
      improve individual shoulder function, while reducing re-tear rates compared to the current
      literature.

      To evaluate this, patches were implanted into 54 shoulders and prospectively followed up
      clinically and radiologically.

    <intervention_name>arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with a polyester patch</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients were operated under general anesthesia and a supraclavicular nerve block, in a beach-chair position with 80Â° forward shoulder flexion and traction between 3-5 kg. After washing and draping a standard viewing portal was placed at the dorsal softspot. Further portals included, a lateral, a dorso-lateral, an antero-lateral and an anterior portal. If additional pathologies were present, they were treated simultaneously and mostly involved the long head of the biceps tendon, treated with tenodesis or tenotomy respectively. After a thorough bursectomy, the rupture was fully visualized and thereafter its size was estimated. Following debridement of the footprint, we used a triple row repair and implanted the patch.</description>
