             interval

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24hrs) within 30 days or less than 10

             this is allowed medications.

             medications causing changes in serum potassium are restricted

          -  Current or previous participation in another interventional trial, including where an
             investigational drug has been or will be administered within 60 days or 5 half-lives
