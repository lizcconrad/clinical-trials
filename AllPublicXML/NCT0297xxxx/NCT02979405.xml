  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension in patients who are taken to surgery, is a very frequent complication, when the
      spinal anesthetical technique is used, associating this with significant adverse effects that
      can lead to morbidity specially in the obstetric patient. The objective of the study is
      determine if the phenylephrine used of prophylactic form, achieved to prevent the appearance
      of hypotension in obstetric patients led to Caesarea under spinal anesthesia.

      Worldwide, the caesarean section is one of the surgical procedures most frequently performed,
      representing a challenge to the anesthesiologist, who must administer anesthesia to the
      mother with minimal effects in the newborn. For this reason, spinal anesthesia emerges as an
      important option in the management of the obstetrical patient who is going to be taken to
      Caesarea. The hypotension, is one of the most frequent events adverse associated to this
      technical anesthetic, represented a risk of complications both, in the mother as in the
      fetus, by this reason the anesthesiologist must implement different strategies to treat it
      when this be present. From there arises the necessity of establishing if the phenylephrine, a
      drug used to treat hypotension, when is administed prophylactically, allows to avoid this
      effect. We designed a randomized clinical trial in elderly patients over 18 years who are
      taken to Caesarea, where they formed two groups of patients, one that will administer a
      prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine compared with placebo, assessing the incidence of
      hypotension in the two groups and the adverse events most commonly associated with this.
