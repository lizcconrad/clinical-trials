    <textblock>
      anti-VEGF therapy is an established method to control leakage and abnormal growth of retinal
      blood vessels. Questions on the long-term effect on the retina, intraocular pressure and on
      the overall retinal perfusion from these treatments remain to be answered. The purpose of the
      study was to evaluate changes in the retina following anti-VEGF treatment over time, using
      structural and functional diagnostic tests.

      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) causes changes in the capillaries that nourish the retina. Two
      treatments clinically used for DR are laser photocoagulation to reduce the angiogenic drive
      by knocking off metabolically active retina and anti-VEGF drugs for diabetic macular edema
      (DME). DME affects approximately 2.5% of the nearly 2.4 million Canadians with diabetes, or
      approximately 60,000 Canadians, making it a major cause of adult-onset vision loss. DME
      occurs when blood vessels in the retina of diabetic patients become leaky resulting in
      unwanted fluid accumulation in the center of vision known as the macula. If not treated, this
      can lead to blindness. Originally used in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD), anti-VEGF drugs are increasingly used to control leakage and abnormal growth of
      retinal blood vessels. Numerous questions have emerged following the usage of anti-VEGF
      medications in the eye such as their long-term effects of these drugs on intraocular pressure
      and on the overall retinal perfusion. By recruiting DR patients requiring anti-VEGF treatment
      for DME, this study will answer whether long-term usage of anti-VEGF will result in
      structural and functional changes to the retina.

    <description>Ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis among others) is a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) created from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab. It is an anti-angiogenic that has been approved to treat the &quot;wet&quot; type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD, also ARMD), a common form of age-related vision loss and diabetic macular edema (DME).</description>
