  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheotomy is requested when upper aero-digestive tracts are obstructed. This obstruction
      can have a tumour, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic or nervous origin. Most tracheotomy
      surgeries are performed for tumour-induced obstruction. Tracheotomy allows the setting of a
      respiratory flux thanks to a cannula and excludes the upper airways. The cannula is washed
      every day from once to several times depending on the patient's secretions production and it
      is usually replaced every week. The second replacement takes place about 10 days after
      surgery. Patient education takes place at every replacement in order to empower him/her and
      in consequence to increase living comfort. This empowerment is achieved at the 4th or 5th
      replacement, at best. Because of the risks and complications related to tracheotomy and
      because of the concerned vital function, the cannula replacement leads to anxiety especially
      during the first replacements. Usual patient's anxiety management consists in reassuring the
      patient during the replacement. In other situations, patients' anxiety management would be
      drugs, however due to sedative and anxiolytic drugs' adverse events and to the need to
      maintain optimal breathing, they are not used in first intention. Our choice is to use
      conversational hypnosis during cannula replacement as it has already demonstrated interesting
      effects in pain and anxiety. Conversational hypnosis does not present an induction phase like
      in so-called hypnosis, it aims at leading the patient to perceive his/her world differently
      with only a slight consciousness alteration.

      Once the informed consent form is signed and when the cannula replacement has to be
      performed, conversational hypnosis session will start right from the patient's room entrance
      and end when the nurse will come out. The care will consist in aspiration, cleaning and
      finally replacement of the cannula. Adverse events are expected to be related to the cannula
      replacement itself: patients will be followed-up during a maximum of 7 days with one
      follow-up visit which will take place 2 hours after cannula replacement and a second one
      which can take place from the day after the replacement up to just before the following
      replacement.

    <time_frame>On the patient's scope, time measured from the moment the nurse says &quot;now we start&quot; according to the conversational hypnosis protocol to the time the new cannula is fixed around the patient's neck, assessed up to 1 hour (3600 seconds).</time_frame>
    <description>Once the written informed consent form is obtained, the tracheal cannula change to perform in the frame of the study can be performed. As the patient will be scoped, the time to change the cannula will be monitored: the nurse will use an indicator on the scope to mark the start of the cannula change (when the sentence &quot;now we start&quot; is pronounced according to the conversational hypnosis protocol) and an indicator is placed on the scope when the new cannula is fixed around the patient's neck. The time between the two indicators will be reported in the Case Report Form in seconds.</description>
