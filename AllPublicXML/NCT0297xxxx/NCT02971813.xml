      While cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to be effective at improving cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), participation is generally poor. For this reason, the current research, a
      prospective, randomized controlled pilot study, will evaluate the impact of a social media
      intervention on motivation for exercise and adherence to CR sessions. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to a Facebook™ group or an enhanced education comparison group. The
      intervention will include access to a private Facebook™ group in which participants will
      receive weekly educational posts, weekly provider support and have the opportunity to
      communicate with other cardiac rehabilitation patients. Patients in the comparison group will
      be given the same educational materials, but these will be supplied in handout form, or email
      if the patient is absent from cardiac rehabilitation. Participants will be asked to fill out
      a pre-post motivational questionnaire and the total number of sessions attended at the end of
      3 months will be tallied. This study is grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and
      utilizes the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2), which is based on the
      SDT.

      Research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of social networking interventions
      used to promote health. Few randomized controlled trials have examined the use of social
      networking as a tool for exercise adherence or health promotion. Further, there is no
      research that addresses the use of social media and particularly Facebook, as a tool to
      affect autonomous motivation in cardiac rehabilitation.

      The purpose of the current randomized pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of using a
      Facebook intervention, providing education, peer support and provider support, to affect
      change in motivation and self-determination for exercise, and adherence to cardiac
      rehabilitation in patients with CHD during a 12-week Phase II cardiac rehabilitation program.
      It is hypothesized that:

        1. Scores for motivation for exercise overall will increase for patients exposed to a
           Facebook intervention and across individual motivational subtypes (regulations) relative
           to a comparison group who receive educational handouts and emails.

        2. Percentage of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended will be higher relative to a
           comparison group who receive educational handouts and emails.

        3. Engagement in the private Facebook group (number of &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;likes&quot;) will predict
           number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended and the change in motivation. The
           feasibility of a larger trial will be based on sample size and participants' engagement
           in the Facebook group.

      Methodology Design This is a prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate the
      feasibility of using a social media intervention to affect change in motivation for exercise
      and adherence to cardiac rehabilitation sessions.

      Setting and Sample The setting for this study will be in the outpatient cardiac
      rehabilitation at the main campus of a large tertiary care center in Northeast Ohio, several
      satellite facilities in the region, and in patients' homes or other locations where home
      computers might be accessed. This cardiac rehabilitation program provides ECG-monitored,
      supervised exercise, dietary guidance, smoking cessation, behavioral counseling and stress
      reduction. All patients receive an individualized exercise prescription based on functional
      capacity at intake. Most patients, depending on insurance coverage, will be able to attend up
      to 3 sessions per week for a total of 36 sessions. In addition, patients are given guidance
      for unsupervised exercise at home.

      All patients who are current and regular Facebook users, have qualified for cardiac
      rehabilitation (diagnosed with CHD), and are entering cardiac rehabilitation at the main
      campus of this tertiary care center, will qualify to participate in the study prior to
      beginning Phase II cardiac rehabilitation. Current Facebook users were chosen as it is
      important that participants are skilled at using the internet and familiar with social media.
      Regular use will be defined as logging onto Facebook at least 2 times in the last month.
      Inclusion criteria will include both men and women 18 years of age or older who speak English
      and live within 100 miles of the main campus of this tertiary care center. Participants must
      be able to read and understand English in order to complete the consent, the Psychological
      Need Satisfaction in Exercise Scale (PNSE) [37] and the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise
      Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3). There will be no exclusion based on secondary diagnosis; however,
      participants must be able to exercise well enough to qualify to take part in cardiac
      rehabilitation.

      Measures The primary hypothesis, change in motivation for exercise, will be measured at
      baseline and post-intervention using the BREQ-3. The BREQ-3 is a 24 question validated
      instrument that measures forms of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of exercise behavior
      [34] and is based on self-determination theory. Psychometrics were first completed for the
      BREQ-2 by Markland and Tobin [38]. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities were as follows:
      amotivation = 0.83, external regulation = 0.79, introjected regulation = 0.80, identified
      regulation = 0.73, and intrinsic regulation = 0.86. The BREQ-3 includes 5 additional
      questions in addition to those on the BREQ-2 and has a new subscale for integrated regulation
      [33]. The subscales (regulations) of the BREQ-3 are used to calculate a relative autonomy
      index (RAI) [39]. Each question is answered on a 5 point Likert scale (0-4) and represents
      one of the regulations. The regulations are weighted then summed to give a single score. The
      resulting score or index gives an indication of the individual respondent's
      self-determination for exercise.

      The RAI will place individual motivational subtypes or behavioral regulations on the
      self-determination continuum from amotivated (lacking intention to exercise) to intrinsically
      motivated (self-determined or autonomously motivated).

      The PNSE will be used to assess need satisfaction with exercise. This scale was designed to
      assess the perception of psychological need satisfaction associated with self-determined
      motivation for exercise and consists of 18 items on a 6 point Likert scale, with 3 subscales
      measuring perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness. The scale showed high internal
      consistency (Cronbach &gt;0.90) [37].

      The secondary hypothesis, the percentage of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended, will be
      measured at the time of cardiac rehabilitation completion or dropout. It will calculated by
      dividing the number of sessions attended in a 3 month period of time by the total number of
      sessions allowed by insurance, and multiplying by 100.

      The tertiary hypothesis, Facebook engagement, will be assessed by measuring the number of
      &quot;likes&quot; by individuals on the private Facebook group. &quot;Likes&quot; (the number of times a
      participant clicks &quot;like&quot; on any of the Facebook posts) will be counted and, along with
      &quot;hits&quot; will be used to examine the association between engagement in the social media
      intervention (Facebook), and cardiac rehabilitation adherence and change in motivation. A
      post-intervention questionnaire will be given to determine number of &quot;hits&quot;. The participants
      will be asked to circle the number of times they accessed the private Facebook group per
      week: 0, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 or &gt; 15 times. The questionnaire will also be used to collect
      qualitative data on participants' perceptions of the intervention, including whether they
      felt supported in their care, more in touch with providers, whether or not they chatted with
      other Facebook members and if the Facebook group affected their exercise behaviors. The
      questionnaire will use a Likert scale (1, &quot;not at all&quot;-5, &quot;quite a bit&quot;) for all questions in
      addition to a section for comments. Participants may also grant permission for the evaluation
      of comments made on the private Facebook group, allowing the researchers to explore themes
      for qualitative analysis. Examination of comments will allow for a better understanding of
      the effectiveness of individual posts and the satisfaction of needs that may lead to
      self-determined motivation.

      Patient characteristics will be collected and will include key demographic variables (age,
      gender, race, employment, distance to cardiac rehabilitation, socioeconomic status),
      engagement (number of &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;likes&quot;), and key clinical variables (cardiac rehabilitation
      indication, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and waist circumference), which will be
      obtained from the electronic medical record.

      Data Collection Procedures Volunteers will be recruited from the main campus of this tertiary
      care center during their inpatient stay or the intake visit for cardiac rehabilitation at the
      main campus and satellite facilities in the region. Volunteers will be screened for Facebook
      use and interest in the study, the protocol will be explained, and volunteers will then be
      asked to sign consent. The consent will address the fact that Facebook is a public forum and
      names and comments are seen by other participants and the research team. The Facebook group
      will be private in the sense that those not in the group will not be able to see the content.
      Participants will be given a baseline BREQ-3 questionnaire and PNSE scale at the time of
      consent. Participants will then be randomized to Facebook versus comparison groups using
      blocked randomization.

      Intervention. The Facebook intervention will include peer support, education, provider
      support and text message prompts when new posts are added. These interventions are designed
      to minimize pressure, offer choices, and allow for peer interaction, positive feedback,
      guidance and direction, in order to provide support for competence, autonomy and relatedness.
      Competence will primarily be supported with use of educational posts in the Facebook group.
      Autonomy support will come from the provider posts. Finally, relatedness will be supported by
      peer interaction and engagement in the Facebook group.

        1. Educational posts will cover 12 topics that will encourage participants to practice
           preventive heart care while offering a variety of suggestions and encouragement for
           making personal healthcare choices. The educational portion of the intervention is
           designed to offer clear information and structure, thus supporting competence which may
           help to enhance intrinsic motivation. These 12 educational topics will be standardized
           such that they will be posted on the Facebook group, one each week and then the same
           ones will be re-posted again every 12 weeks. The posts may be in the form of text, video
           and/or pictures and will include materials from the hospital's health library and other
           fact sheets and videos produced by the hospital, the American Heart Association and the
           Center for Disease Control.

        2. Provider posts will include topics such as motivational quotes, encouragement, reminders
           to exercise independently, and reminders to contact providers with questions. These
           postings are designed to promote a sense of choice and help participants feel that
           providers see them as having a unique frame of reference thus being autonomy-supportive.
           Providers will be nurses on the research team, exercise physiologists and nurse
           practitioners and physicians who may or may not choose to reveal personal identities.
           All Facebook participants will see the same content. Provider support will also include
           links to provider health chats, in which patients can chat online with providers at set
           dates and times.

        3. Peer interaction on Facebook will be as frequently as the participant freely chooses to
           do so and will be monitored daily by the research team for appropriateness of content.
           Engagement in Facebook is designed to offer an opportunity for social inclusion and a
           sense of involvement, allowing for relatedness.

      The comparison group will receive the same educational and provider support materials as the
      Facebook group but will receive it in the form of a handout, or via email in the event the
      patient cannot be contacted or misses cardiac rehabilitation on a particular week. Both
      groups will have the opportunity for weekly education classes and typical peer interactions,
      which will involve up to 3 hours of group cardiac rehabilitation per week.

      Upon cardiac rehabilitation completion or dropout, post-data will be collected. It is
      anticipated that this pilot will take up to one year and will be completed when 30
      participants for each group have been obtained.

      Data Analysis Statistical Methods. This is a feasibility study and the sample size obtained
      will determine if the study is appropriately powered to detect the desired effect size.
      Patient characteristics will be summarized by group using frequencies and percentages for
      categorical factors, and means and standard deviations for continuous measures. In order to
      examine the primary outcome, differences in change in motivation between groups, overall
      motivation using the RAI from the BREQ-3 will be evaluated using analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA) models. Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for group differences will be
      presented. Multivariate analysis of variance models will be used to evaluate differences in
      the change across individual motivation subtypes (regulations), using the BREQ-3, between
      groups overall. If significant, separate ANCOVA models for each subtype will be fit. Similar
      ANCOVA models will be used to compare changes in needs satisfaction scores, overall and
      separately among the three subscales, between groups. Two-sample t-tests will be used to
      compare number of sessions completed. As a secondary analysis, the relationships between
      patient characteristics, &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;likes&quot;, and the outcome variables RAI change, number of
      sessions, and needs satisfaction change will be examined using t-tests and Pearson
      correlations. The correlation between changes in RAI and needs satisfaction will also be
      evaluated. Analyses will be performed using SAS software (version 9.4; Cary, NC). An overall
      significance level of 0.05 will be assumed for all tests.

      Sample Size. The investigators plan to enroll 30 patients in each group. In the first 9
      months of 2016, cardiac rehabilitation at the main campus of this tertiary care center had
      approximately 170 patient intakes. It is assumed that there will be a similar number of
      patient intakes for a 9 month period in 2017. Based on Facebook participation rates for those
      over age 50 [21] and the high participation rates in previous research projects in this
      facility's cardiac rehabilitation, it is estimated that 40% may meet eligibility requirements
      and agree to participate. Allowing for use of the first 8 participants to establish the
      Facebook group, the estimated sample size would then be 60 total participants for
      randomization to study group who can then be included in analysis. With this sample size,
      there will be 86% power to detect large effect sizes (d=0.8) for our study outcomes [40]. The
      primary aim of this sample size determination is to evaluate whether the proposed
      intervention is feasible, and to estimate the differences that might exist so that a larger
      trial that would have adequate power to detect smaller differences could be designed based on
      what was learned in this pilot study. The sample size of 30 per group was chosen primarily to
      facilitate a large intervention group, since the value of the intervention is predicated upon
      interaction among the participants.
