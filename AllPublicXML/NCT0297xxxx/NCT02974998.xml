      This two-arm cluster randomized trial is testing a gender-focused comprehensive HIV testing
      and counselling (HTC) program, the Young Women's Health CoOp (YWHC) with a standard HTC
      program and will target female adolescents (aged 16-19) who use substances and have dropped
      out of school. To evaluate the process, the study will examine the feasibility of using peer
      role models as recruiters and co-facilitators of the intervention and monitor fidelity to the
      intervention. Efficacy of the intervention on behavioral and biological outcomes, and on
      linkages to health services, through follow-up visits conducted 6- and 12-months
      post-enrollment will be also assessed.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a gender-focused comprehensive HIV testing and
      counselling (HTC) program, the Young Women's Health CoOp (YWHC) with a standard HTC program
      in 24 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa. The researchers are conducting
      community-level randomization across the 24 communities with balanced recruitment from
      predominantly Black African and predominantly Coloured disadvantaged communities. The aims of
      the study are: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community
      outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of-school, substance-using
      female adolescents aged 16 to 19 for HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and to co-facilitate a
      gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's
      gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and
      sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and
      support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, sexually
      transmitted infections [STIs], antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes)
      relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. The Young Women's Health CoOperative has
      been adapted from the South African Women's Health CoOperative (WHC) and the North Carolina
      Young Women's CoOperative (YWC) which was found acceptable in recent focus groups and
      maintains all the core elements of the evidence-based intervention. For this study, the
      intervention is co-facilitated by trained staff from the local communities. The intervention
      currently consists of two 1.5-hour group workshops (sessions), each having several modules
      that are usually administered a week apart: Workshop 1: Developmental Issues and Alcohol and
      Other Drugs; Gender, Problem-Solving and Conflict Negotiation, Violence and Values and
      Becoming a Powerful Young Woman: and Workshop 2: STIs, HIV/AIDS, Prevention, Condoms and
      Role-play. After each session, each participant develops a risk-reduction personalized action
      plan (PAP). To maintain PAP goals and reduce decay of intervention effects over time, the
      staff conduct bi-monthly case management to help participants attain these personal goals.
      Participants complete baseline, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up assessments, which
      include a survey and biological testing for substance use, pregnancy and HIV.
