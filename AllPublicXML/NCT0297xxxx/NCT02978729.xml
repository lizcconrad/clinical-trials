    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for remote genetic counseling (telephone
      and two-way videoconferencing) for patients who are receiving disclosure of their APOE
      (apolipoprotein E) genotype. The target population will consist of males and females in the
      age range of 60-75 years who, as potential participants in a study (Generation Study), will
      need to receive genetic counseling and disclosure of APOE genotype. Subjects must be willing
      to receive genetic counseling and disclosure remotely. Subjects must be willing to be
      randomized to either telephone arm or videoconference arm.

    <description>Telephone telegenetic counseling: A trained Penn genetic counselor will conduct genotype disclosure visits with the participant via telephone. The participant will be in a private room at the study site. Telephone sessions will utilize a private phone line. The genetic counselor will use standardized disclosure checklist and visual aids for the disclosure session.</description>

    <description>Two-way videoconferencing telegenetic counseling: A trained Penn genetic counselor will conduct genotype disclosure visits with the participant via two-way videoconferencing. The participant will be in a private room at the study site. Videoconferencing sessions will utilize tablets or laptops with web cameras and secure/confidential software for teleconferencing. The genetic counselor will use standardized disclosure checklist and visual aids for the disclosure session.</description>
