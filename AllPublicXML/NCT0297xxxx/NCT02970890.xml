  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic degenerative muscle disease characterized by cartilage wear,
      causes progressive joint deformity and loss of function leading to the indication of total
      hip arthroplasty (THA), when conservative treatments fail. Surgical trauma leads to pain and
      induces an immune response. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has proven effective in tissue
      repair by modulating the inflammatory process and promoting pain relief. It can therefore be
      part of the treatment. This study aims to analyze the effect of PMBT on inflammation and pain
      of patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty. The study consisted of eighteen patients
      who underwent hip arthroplasty and they received phototherapy in a period from 8 to 12 hours
      after surgery. We divided the patients into two groups (n=9 each) placebo and effective
      phototherapy. The patients were evaluated before and after phototherapy with 9 diodes,
      applied to 5 points along the scar (1 laser 905nm, 4 LEDs 875nm and 4 LEDs 640nm, 40.3J
      total), by visual analogue scale (VAS) and blood collection for analysis of the levels of the
      cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8.
