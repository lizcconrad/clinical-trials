    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is the most common surgical procedure performed on women. Over the years
      minor variations of each surgical step have been introduced, and cesarean sections are not
      standardized and many different techniques are employed during surgery. Creation of a bladder
      flap has been an integral surgical step of the cesarean section for many years. The role of
      the bladder flap and its usefulness in cesarean section is not known well. Further, in some
      cases the bladder flap is omitted during cesarean section. The aim of the current study is to
      compare operating time and postoperative urinary symptoms in cesarean sections using either
      bladder flap or omission of flap.

      Cesarean section is the most common surgical procedure performed on women. The main aspects
      of the surgical approach to low-transverse cesarean delivery have not changed much since1926.
      Over the years minor variations of each surgical step have been introduced, and cesarean
      sections are not standardized and many different techniques are employed during surgery.
      Creation of a bladder flap has been an integral surgical step of the cesarean section for
      many years. The evidence on the role of the bladder flap and its usefulness in cesarean
      section is very limited. In emergent cesarean sections where rapid delivery is the main goal,
      the bladder flap is usually omitted. Literature about the usefulness of a bladder flap is
      limited and more randomized studies are needed. Most of the study outcomes were focusing
      operating time however, the investigator in the current study additional focused on
      postoperative urinary symptoms and dynamics. The aim of the current study is to compare
      operating time and postoperative urinary symptoms in cesarean sections using either bladder
      flap or omission of flap.
