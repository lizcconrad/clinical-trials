  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate whether thiamine can increase oxygen consumption and lower lactate
      in patients who initially survive an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients who are
      successfully resuscitated after an in-hospital cardiac arrest and who are on mechanical
      ventilation in the intensive care unit will be enrolled, and will get either thiamine or
      placebo. Their oxygen consumption and lactate will be measured at serial time points and
      compared between groups. The investigators' hypothesis is that thiamine will help restore the
      body's ability to metabolize oxygen normally (aerobic metabolism), leading to an increase in
      oxygen consumption and a decrease in lactate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-hospital cardiac arrest often leads to shock and organ failure, and low oxygen consumption
      and high lactate are associated with worse outcome. Thiamine is a B vitamin necessary to
      maintain the body's ability to use oxygen effectively, and the investigators have found that
      many patients are thiamine deficient after cardiac arrest. The investigators have also found
      that thiamine can decrease lactate in thiamine-deficient patients who are critically ill.
      Patients in this study will be randomized to receive either thiamine or placebo every 12
      hours for 2 days after surviving an in-hospital cardiac arrest. The investigators will
      measure oxygen consumption continuously during that time with a monitor attached to the
      ventilator tubing, and will also measure lactate and other lab values at several time points.
