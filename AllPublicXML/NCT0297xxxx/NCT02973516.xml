      This study is an exploratory study aiming to collect data about diagnosis efficacy
      (sensitivity and specificity) of P03277 triphasic liver imaging for HCC in subjects with
      suspected small nodules and chronic liver disease. 30 subjects will be included, having HCC
      confirmed or not by previous enhanced CT and/or MRI and before any biopsy for histology
      analysis. The standard of reference for diagnosis will be given by the site according to
      their standard of care and adapted from EASL/EORTC diagnostic criteria (considering previous
      contrast enhanced imaging (CT and/or MRI) and/or biopsy specimen analysis given on-site
      and/or the more recent AFP results available).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject presenting with liver cirrhosis or chronic liver disease as shown by previous
             liver biopsy or by combination of clinical, endoscopic, biological, ultrasound
             parameters, and elastography

          -  Subject presenting with 1 to a maximum of 3 untreated hepatic nodule(s) of less than
             or equal to 3 cm (long axis) previously identified and/or characterized through
             enhanced CT and/or MRI within a maximum of 21 days before P03277 imaging, confirmed
             for HCC or not

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject presenting with hepatic nodule more than 3 cm in addition to nodule(s) less
             than or equal to 3 cm

          -  Subject already treated for HCC by surgery or thermal ablation for which the resection
             or coagulation area is less than 2 cm from the new nodule(s)

          -  Subject previously treated by transarterial chemoembolization

          -  Subject with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) based on
             measurement done or available within the 7 days before P03277 administration and
             assessed after any iodinated contrast agent administration, or with dialysis end stage
             renal disease (ESRD)
