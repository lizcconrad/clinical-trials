      Assess response to pembrolizumab in both primary tumor, normal breast stroma, circulating
      lymphocytes and serum exosomes in treatment naive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      patients.

      Assess for change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) both stromal (sTILS) and
      intraepithelial (iTILS) in newly diagnosed early stage TNBC patients treated with two doses
      of MK-3475 prior to lumpectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, single institution pre-operative &quot;window of opportunity
      study&quot; of pembrolizumab in subjects with newly diagnosed triple-negative, &lt; 3 cm, node
      negative breast cancer. Subjects may not have received any prior neo/adjuvant chemotherapy,
      definitive surgery or radiation treatment prior to enrollment.

      The goal of this project is to determine if immune modulation through treatment with MK-3475
      (Pembrolizumab) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients will alter expression of
      immune tolerant markers [including PD-L1], within the primary tumor. Investigators hope to
      determine if MK-3475 exposure will change the molecular signature of breast stroma from
      &quot;normal&quot; adjacent breast tissue (non-tumor tissue) obtained prospectively at the time of
      breast conserving surgery (BCS) in TNBC patients. Finally, investigators will investigate how
      pembrolizumab alters breast stromal response to high dose radiation delivered by
      intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT).

    <description>This outcome measure is designed to determine if immune modulation therapy with MK-3475 will increase TILs in newly diagnosed TNBC tumors. The mean percent change in TILS in tumor tissue from initial core biopsy samples will be compared with pathology samples from definitive surgery after two cycles of MK-3475.</description>

    <description>Participants receive 'Merck 3475 Pembrolizumab' by vein two weeks before Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT).
The Intrabeam® Photon Radiosurgery System is a miniature electron beam-driven X-ray source which provides a point source of low energy X-rays (50 kV maximum) at the tip of a 3.2 mm diameter tube. The radiation source can be inserted into the area of interest immediately after excision of the tumor and switched on for 20-35 minutes to provide intraoperative radiotherapy accurately targeted to the tissues that are at the highest risk of local recurrence. The dosimetric characteristics and early clinical applications of this device have been well studied and this is the device which was utilized in the international TARGIT trial.</description>

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          2. Be &gt; or = 21 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Histologically proven invasive breast carcinoma with triple negative receptor status
             (Estrogen receptor, Progesterone receptor and HER2 negative by IHC and FISH). Patients
             who are weekly positive for the estrogen or progesterone receptor (i.e., &lt; or = 10%)
             are eligible.

          4. Clinically ≤ 3 cm unifocal lesion by imaging or physical examination.

          5. Clinically node negative, no evidence of metastatic disease.
