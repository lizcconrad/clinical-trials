  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of older people in Europe grows, increasing healthy life years is a priority.
      As people live longer, ensuring good mental as well as physical health into later years is
      becoming ever more important. Cognitive decline, dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease, AD),
      sleep disturbances and depression, all related to psychological distress and anxiety, are
      significant drivers of reduced quality of life in older adults. This project builds on
      evidence that meditation practice have the potential to downregulate these adverse factors
      and positively impact mental and neurological conditions including AD.
