      Part A of the study is an open-label design with morning dosing of SAGE-217 for 7 days.

      Part B of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design with
      morning dosing for 7 days.

      Parts A and B of the study are closed to enrollment.

      Part C of the study is an open-label design with evening dosing for 14 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have a diagnosis of ET, defined as bilateral postural tremor and kinetic
             tremor, involving hands and forearms, that is visible and persistent and the duration
             is &gt;5 years prior to screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has presence of abnormal neurological signs other than tremor or Froment's
             sign.

          -  Subject has presence of known causes of enhanced physiological tremor.

          -  Subject has concurrent or recent exposure (14 days prior to admission visit) to
             tremorogenic drugs.

          -  Subject has had direct or indirect trauma to the nervous system within 3 months before
             the onset of tremor.

          -  Subject has historical or clinical evidence of tremor with psychogenic origin.

          -  Subject has convincing evidence of sudden tremor onset or evidence of stepwise
             deterioration of tremor.
