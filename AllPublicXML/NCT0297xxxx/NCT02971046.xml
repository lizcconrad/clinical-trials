    <textblock>
      The fractional and absolute synthesis rates of GSH, an antioxidant that protects cells from
      damage, in the erythrocytes of healthy school-aged children in response to graded intakes of
      protein to determine if increasing the protein intake above the current recommended DRI
      produces increases in the GSH synthesis rates in erythrocytes of healthy school-aged
      children. Participants will consume specially formulated diets with varying protein levels.

    <textblock>
      Glutathione (GSH) is important to protect the cells of the body. It is made from amino acids
      found in the protein obtained from foods we eat. This antioxidant is important to protect the
      cells of the body from damage. Low levels of GSH are found in healthy persons not getting
      enough protein in their diet. Inadequate protein intake in children not only compromises
      growth, but could increase susceptibility to, and compromise recovery from regular childhood
      illness. Measurement of GSH synthesis provides a functional method whereby the current
      protein recommendation can be tested against higher estimates derived using the IAAO method.

      The current dietary reference intake (DRI) recommendations for protein in children between
      the ages of 6-11 years is based on nitrogen balance data and set at a mean (EAR) and
      population safe (RDA) recommendation of 0.76 and 0.95g.kg-1.d-1 respectively. Using the
      indicator amino oxidation (IAAO) method we estimated the mean and population safe protein
      requirement in the same age group of children to be 1.3 and 1.55g.kg-1.d-1 respectively.The
      purpose of this study therefore is to measure GSH synthesis in school aged children aged 6-11
      years in response to current recommended protein intake and in response to protein
      requirement estimate derived using the IAAO method.
