  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with
      Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab in subjects with resected Stages IIIB/IIIC/ IV
      melanoma.

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that PD-1 blockade combined with CTLA-4 blockade using
      ipilimumab would have a favorable effect on the expansion and activity of human CD8+ T
      cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for tumor-associated antigens (ie, self antigens),
      which would translate into improved anti-cancer therapy.

                  sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a
                  period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product Women who are
                  not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile
                  as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.

                  restrictions specified in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who fulfill any of the following conditions at Screening will not be eligible
             for admission into the study:

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs;

          -  Prior non-melanoma malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for locally
             curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix or
             breast;

          -  Subjects with any active autoimmune disease (Appendix 3) or a documented history of
             autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or
             immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood
             asthma/atopy;

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS);

          -  Positive tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV SAg) or hepatitis C virus
             ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating active or chronic infection;

          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PDL-2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (or
             any other antibody targeting T cell co-stimulation pathways);

          -  Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications, or
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic or absorbable topical corticosteroids;

          -  Underlying medical condition (eg, a condition associated with diarrhea) that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would make the administration of either study drug or both
             study drugs hazardous to the subject or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events;

          -  Pregnant or nursing; or

          -  Current participation in another clinical study involving treatment with medications,
             radiation or surgery, or prior participation in this study.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been
             treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for
             [lowest minimum is 4 weeks or more] after treatment is complete and within 28 days
             prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement
             for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone
             equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.

        As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab
        combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in
        patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction

               1. History of allergy to study drug components

               2. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
