  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity, as
      well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS) in combination with a multiagent
      chemotherapy regimen, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine, in pediatric
      participants with advanced stage newly diagnosed classical CD30+ Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is
      being tested to treat pediatric participants who have advanced stage, newly diagnosed,
      classical CD30+ HL. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity,
      as well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in combination with a multiagent
      chemotherapy regimen that is based on a current standard of care (SOC) first-line treatment
      regimen for newly diagnosed HL.

      The study will enroll approximately 55 evaluable participants. The study will be conducted in
      2 phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 study will enroll up to 12 participants to determine
      the recommended dose. Once the recommended dose is identified additional participants will be
      enrolled into phase 2 so that the total number of evaluable participants will be
      approximately 55, including participants treated at recommended dose in Phase 1. Participants
      will be enrolled in the following 2 dose Cohorts:

      â€¢ Brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m^2 or 36 mg/m^2 in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine,
      and dacarbazine.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States (US), Italy, Spain, Brazil, Japan,
      Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The overall time to participate in this study is
      approximately 55 months, including the follow-up period. Participants will be followed for a
      maximum of 30 days following the last dose of protocol therapy for a follow-up assessment and
      will be followed for survival until death or study closure or a maximum of 2 years after
      enrollment of the last participant.

If the first 6 participants complete the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period with 0 or 1 participant experiencing a DLT, 48 mg/m^2 will be established as the recommended dose for phase 2 study. If at any time more than 1 participant out of a maximum 6 DLT-evaluable participants experiences a DLT, brentuximab vedotin dose will be reduced to 36 mg/m^2. If 0 or 1 participant experiences a DLT among the 6 participants treated at 36 mg/m^2, 36 mg/m^2 will be established as recommended dose for phase 2 study. If more than 1 participant experiences a DLT in the first 6 participants treated at 36 mg/m^2, the study will be discontinued.</description>
