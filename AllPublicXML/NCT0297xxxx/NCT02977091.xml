      fitness and Physical activity will be evaluate in short stature children, using the Euro
      Fitness testing and the Wingate anaerobic test. the fitness level will be evaluate in healthy
      short children and with growth hormone deficiency at base line and after 6 month .

      The Euro Fitness testing which is a series of field testing for children evaluating aerobic,
      strength and flexibility and the Wingate anaerobic test which is a 30 seconds maximum
      pedaling against resistance on bike for evaluating the anaerobic fitness.

      the fitness test will be done in healthy short stature children and in growth hormone
      deficiency or idiopathic short stature from the endocrine unit in Meir medical center The
      test will be done at base line and after 6 month . The fitness test in child with growth
      hormone deficiency will be done before starting GH treatment and 6 month later.

      The child will be asked to fill a questioner about his daily physical activity Anthropometric
      measurement will be taking including weight, height and fat percent. Details about age, sex,
      tanner stage, indication for growth hormone, dose, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF1) level will
      be taken from the medical file.
