  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators,according to the eligibility criteria,plane to choose 80 elderly
      anticipates who will undergo selective hip replacement surgery.This participants will be
      randomly divided into 2 groups:light anesthesia depth group(L Group) and deep anesthesia
      depth group (D Group).Before anesthesia induction,each participant will be given lumbar
      plexus and sciatic nerve block in order to control pain of interoperative and
      postoperative.During operation period,the L Group will be kept in light anesthesia
      depth(BIS:50-60),while the D group will be kept in deep anesthesia depth(BIS:35-45)--The BIS
      values in the range of 30-60 have been recommended in general anesthesia.After operation,a
      PCIA(patient controlled intravenous analgesia) analgesia pump will be given to each
      participant to control postoperative pain. The investigator will evaluate the mental state of
      participant with MMSE(mini-mental state examination) before surgery and review each
      participant with a CAM-CR for 3 days after surgery to assess the situation of postoperation
      delirium.intraoperative awareness,postoperative pain will also be investigated in
      postoperative days 1, 2, 3.

      The investigators,according to the eligibility criteria,plane to choose 80 elderly
      participants who will undergo selective hip replacement surgery.This participants will be
      randomly divided into 2 groups:light anesthesia depth group(BIS:50-60) and deep anesthesia
      depth group (BIS:35-45)--The BIS values in the range of 30-60 have been recommended in
      general anesthesia.Before anesthesia induction,each participant will be given lumbar plexus
      and sciatic nerve block in order to control pain of intraoperative and postoperative.The
      investigator use propofol 4ug\kg、and sufentanil 0.2ug\kg during anesthesia induction
      period,after that,a Laryngeal mask will be placed into patient's mouth.Anesthesia is
      maintained with remifentanil TCI(target-controlled infusion) target-controlled
      infusion(concentration:2ng/ml) and propofol BIS closed-loop target-controlled infusion.During
      the operation period ,the investigator keep the L Group`s BIS range from 50 to 60.While the D
      Group`s BIS range from 35 to 45.All participants receive postoperative analgesia.After
      operation,all participants will be send to PACU(post-anaesthesia care unit ) to wake up and
      send back to ward,And a PCIA(patient controlled intravenous analgesia) analgesia pump will be
      given to each participants to control postoperative pain.The investigators will use
      MMSE(mini-mental state examination) to evaluate the participant's mental state before
      surgery.For 3 days after operation,The investigator will review each participant with a
      CAM-CR to assess the situation of postoperation delirium.The investigator will see if there
      is intraoperative awareness by asking questions.Postoperative pain(with VAS) will also be
      investigated in postoperative days 1, 2, 3.

    <description>The participants in L Group will receive Lumbar plexus and sciatic nerve block with ropivacaine before anesthesia induction.The investigator use Diprivan TCI target-controlled infusion during anesthesia induction period, target effect-site concentration is set at 4.0g / kg. After reaching the target concentration, sufentanil 0.2g / kg is administrated, Laryngeal mask will be placed into participant's mouth at 2 min after sufentanil is given. Anesthesia will be maintained with remifentanil TCI target-controlled infusion and Diprivan BIS close-loop target controlled infusion,BIS ranges from 50 to 60.The values of BP,P,PetCO2 will be controled in proper site. each participant will be given postoperative analgesia pump to release postoperative pain.</description>
