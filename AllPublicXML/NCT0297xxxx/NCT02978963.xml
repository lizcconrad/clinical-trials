  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case series aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of streamlined cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents with excessive worry. The treatment protocol focuses
      on reducing intolerance of uncertainty and the hypothesis is that this will help reduce
      worry.

      This pilot study aims to test a new form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for adolescents with
      excessive worry. The investigators will include 12 participants with excessive worry and test
      the treatment which focuses on reducing intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in order to reduce
      worry.

      Participants will be randomized to either one, two or three weeks of weekly baseline
      measurements prior to starting treatment, and will thus work as their on controls in this
      case series design.

      Primary outcome measures will be collected at 12 weeks after treatment start. Participants
      will be followed up at three months after treatment.

    <description>All participants will receive cognitive behavioral therapy for excessive worry. Focus in treatment will be on reducing participants' intolerance uncertainty through in vivo and imaginary exposure to uncertainty inducing situations and thoughts. Treatment will also contain psycho education about anxiety and worry, as well as planning for maintenance of treatment gains. Parents of the participants will receive support and education about worry through an internet-delivered program.</description>
