  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partially defective dental restorations might either be treated by complete replacement or by
      repair of the affected region. Repair restorations are a scientifically proven approach to
      manage failed restorations, but probably unknown to most patients. Results from this study
      and findings on the predictors of patients' therapy decisions might improve future patient
      information documents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Handling insufficient restorations contributes up to 2/3 of all treatments in dentistry.
      Formerly, defective restorations were completely removed and replaced. Today, repair
      restorations are an alternative choice. During repair treatment, only the defective portion
      of a restoration (instead of the complete restoration) is removed and replaced. By performing
      repair restorations dental hard tissue can be conserved and the risk of treatment associated
      complications is reduced.

      Recent studies have shown that survival rates of repair restorations are slightly lower
      compared to replacement fillings. Nevertheless, in certain clinical situations repair
      restorations are more cost-effective than replacement.

      Further studies have shown that patients' decisions differ with regard to a variety of
      factors. This applies to decisions regarding dental treatments as well. However, patients'
      decisions between both possible therapy options (repair or replacement) of partially
      defective restorations are not yet investigated.
