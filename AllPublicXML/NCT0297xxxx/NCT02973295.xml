  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of Silymarin in reducing laboratory, ultrasonographic
      (Fibroscan) and metabolic components of NAFLD. Half of the patients will receive Silymarin
      (Verum) while the other half will receive placebo
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study will participate patients who come to the regular ambulatory examinations
      (referred by gastroenterologists, nephrologists or family physicians in the Department of
      Gastroenterology and Department of Nephrology, dialysis and kidney transplantation KBC
      Rijeka) and have one or more components of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, diabetes,
      obesity, dyslipidemia).Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will be defined by transient
      elastography (FibroScan, Echosens, Paris); Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) for
      assesment of liver steatosis and Liver Stiffness Measurements (LSM) for liver fibrosis. In
      all patients other causes of chronic liver disease will be excluded; chronic viral hepatitis,
      autoimmune diseases and other metabolic liver diseases as well as use of drugs than can cause
      liver steatosis and fibrosis and alcoholic liver disease.

      This study will include 350 patients. Taking into account the possible drop-out rate around
      15% of the patients during the study period, a total of 400 patients will be randomized.
      Patients will be randomized into two groups. The first group will be consisted of the
      patients with NAFLD who will be receiving Verum therapy during the 6 month period. The second
      group will be consisted of the patients with NAFLD who will be receiving placebo during the 6
      months period, which will be identical to the Verum preparation in its packaging and form.

      After the 6 months of therapy in all patients will be evaluated: liver enzymes and metabolic
      laboratory parameters of NAFLD (insulin resistance, lipidogram and serum glucose), as well as
      the TE-CAP in order to evaluate the efficiency of Silymarin for the treatment of NAFLD.
