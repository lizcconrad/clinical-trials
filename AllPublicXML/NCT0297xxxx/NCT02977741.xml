      Prospective, observational study evaluating the effect of olanzapine for the treatment of
      refractory chronic nausea and vomiting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified who are seen in the Johns Hopkins Gastroenterology Clinic, suffer
      from chronic nausea and vomiting that is refractory to both prokinetic and antiemetic
      medications, and are being prescribed olanzapine for treatment of nausea and vomiting.
      Patients who meet criteria will be enrolled and their gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of
      life, and psychological symptoms will be assessed by various questionnaires and followed over
      the course of 3 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea and vomiting severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of olanzapine on refractory nausea and vomiting as per changes in patient scoring of the severity of nausea and vomiting on a daily visual analog scale (VAS). Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of upper gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of olanzapine on severity of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, assessed by the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Gastrointestinal Symptom Scales questionnaire. The questionnaire is 60-item GI symptom questionnaire covering 8 domains: Gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A scoring service is used to convert the raw scores to a final T-score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life and functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of olanzapine on quality of life and functional status, assessed by the EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The EQ-5D descriptive system consists of five dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, Anxiety/depression. Scores range from 5-25, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms/decreased quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom-specific anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of olanzapine on patient's overall gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety, assessed by the Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI) questionnaire. The VSI is an instrument to assess gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, the cognitive, affective, and behavioral response to fear of gastrointestinal sensations, symptoms, and the context in which these visceral sensations and symptoms occur. The questionnaire consists of 15 questions, each scored 1-6. Total scores range from 15-90, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of depression in participants both before initiating olanzapine and after starting olanzapine, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Total score is determined by adding together the scores for each of the 4 items. Scores range from 0-12 and are rated as normal (0-2), mild depression (3-5), moderate depression (6-8), and severe depression (9-12).</description>
