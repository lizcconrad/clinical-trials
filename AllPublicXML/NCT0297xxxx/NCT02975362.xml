      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether acupuncture combined with
      rehabilitation treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke
      patients. In this 8-week, assessor-blind, a Multi-center randomized, controlled study of
      acupuncture as additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 240
      patients with stroke patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to
      acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (n =120) or rehabilitation treatment (n
      =120). (40 sessions, 5 sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured
      using Fugl-Meyer Scale and Modified Barthel Index. Change in the stroke syndromes over time
      are measured using stroke syndrome of TCM Scale. Change in the quality of life over time are
      measured using SS-QOL scale. The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of
      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional disorder is a common and serious consequence of stroke. A large proportion of
      stroke patients develop motor dysfunction in the early stage after stroke. Acupuncture is
      often used as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. It has been widely
      applied to be a kind of effective treatment for stroke in China. But, there is meta-analysis
      suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor
      recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo
      effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation
      remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies.

      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether acupuncture combined with
      rehabilitation treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke
      patients.

      In this 8-week, assessor-blind, a Multi-center randomized, controlled study of acupuncture as
      additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 240 patients with stroke
      patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to acupuncture combined
      with rehabilitation treatment (n =120) or rehabilitation treatment (n =120). (40 sessions, 5
      sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured using Fugl-Meyer Scale
      and Modified Barthel Index. Change in the stroke syndromes over time are measured using
      stroke syndrome of TCM Scale. Change in the quality of life over time are measured using
      SS-QOL scale.The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese
      Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital.

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale for motor function, the FMA was developed as the first quantitative evaluative instrument for measuring sensorimotor stroke recovery, which includes an assessment of the upper extremity (UE, 66 points) and lower extremity (LE, 34 points). The motor domain has well-established reliability and validity as an indicator of motor impairment severity across different stroke recovery time points</description>

    <description>The Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) is a patient-reported outcome measure intended to provide an assessment of health-related quality of life, specific to patients with stroke. The SS-QOL questionnaire consists of 49 items in the 12 domains of energy, family roles, language, mobility, mood, personality, self-care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity function, vision, and work. Scoring of the SS-QOL is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Response options are scored as 5 (&quot;no help needed/no trouble at all/strongly disagree&quot;), 4 (&quot;a little help/a little trouble/moderately disagree&quot;), 3 (&quot;some help/some trouble/neither agree nor disagree&quot;), 2 (&quot;a lot of help/a lot of trouble/moderately agree&quot;), and 1 (&quot;total help/could not do it at all/strongly agree&quot;). The domains are scored separately, and a total score is also calculated, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <description>The Barthel Index(BI) is a scale that measures ten basic aspects of activity daily living related to self-care and mobility. For the Chinese Modified Barthel Index(MBI) version, the ten items are: continence of bowels and bladder, feeding, dressing, transferring to and from a toilet, grooming, bathing, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, walking on level surface for 45 meters, and ascend and descend stairs. Standard for Evaluation：Each item (activity) be divided into 5 levels, different level represents a different degree of independence, the lowest level is 1 and the highest level is 5.The more higher level, more independence. The normal score is 100. If a person score is 100, he is able to get along without attendant care.</description>

    <description>The Stroke Syndrome of TCM (SSTCM) was developed mainly based on quantified index of TCM symptoms. The SSTCM includes signs and symptoms which were the most concern of the patients and doctors themselves after stroke. SSTCM mainly consists of two domains: TCM symptoms and pulse conditions and tongue pictures. TCM symptoms area contains 24 items. The assessment standards of each item was divided into four levels and corresponding scores (normal = 0, light = 1, middle=2, heavy = 3) according different degree base on the severity of the symptoms and the impacts on life. Pulse conditions and tongue pictures record contents only, not to score. The total score is calculated from the domain one, with lower scores indicating the lighter degree of the symptom severity and the less impact on life. The SSTCM was evaluated by experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctors who were accepted the unification of assessment training.</description>
