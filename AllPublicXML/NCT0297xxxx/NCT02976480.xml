      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the irrigation or non-irrigation of a
      simple laceration treated in the emergency department has an effect on the subsequent rate of
      infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Current guidelines recommend that lacerations be irrigated prior to their
      closure. However, there is very little data in the literature suggesting that simple
      laceration irrigation diminishes the subsequent rate of infection. Do patients benefit from
      this practice that involves additional time and costs?

      Hypothesis Testing &amp; Procedure: The purpose of this double-blind randomized controlled
      non-inferiority study is to test the hypothesis that the non-irrigation of lacerations does
      not increase the rate of post-repair infection. Every adult patients presenting to the
      Chicoutimi's Hospital Emergency Department with a simple laceration will be identify by the
      triage nurse. Eligibility will subsequently be assessed by the emergency room physician
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible and consenting patients will be
      randomized to either the irrigation or non-irrigation arm. Post-repair rate of infection and
      aesthetic appearance satisfaction will be reported.

      Sample Size Determination: With the fairly liberal inclusion criteria, a 6% wound infection
      rate in the irrigation group is expected, which corresponds to the upper limit of the 2 to 6%
      range reported in the literature. Non-inferiority of non-irrigation would be accepted if the
      rate of infection in this group does not exceed by 4% the usual infection rate of 6% with
      irrigation, as previously stated. As such, for the study to be powered at 80% with a 95%
      one-sided confidence interval, a population of 874 patients would be needed to conclude that
      the non-irrigation is non-inferior when its infection rate does not exceed by more than 4%
      the infection rate of the irrigation group. In addition, to account for an attrition rate of
      approximately 10%, enrolment of 1000 patients is aimed.

      Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis will be done by a certified statistician.
      According to the distribution of our data, the Chi2 or the Fisher test will be used. A
      preliminary analysis of our data will be done in the Spring 2017 to assess safety of our
      intervention.

      Plan for Missing Data: Patients that are lost at follow up will be considered as having had
      no infection if no record of subsequent visits for wound infection is found after
      consultation of the regional Electronic Medical Record.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Laceration infection following repair</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days post-repair</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measured will be the 30-day post-repair infection rate in both study groups.
At 30 days post-repair, patients will be contacted by phone by a trained nurse. A standardized form will be used to collect relevant information. Patients will be asked whether they consulted a physician for a wound infection, and if antibiotics or drainage was required. An infected wound is defined as one requiring either drainage or antibiotic treatment by the assessing physician.
The regional Medical Electronic Record will be reviewed for patients that were lost at follow up. Records of subsequent visits for wound infection will be looked for at 30 days post-repair.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Laceration infections following repair</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 to 10 days post-repair</time_frame>
    <description>The wounds of enrolled subjects will systematically be evaluated by a nurse between 5 to 10 days post-repair. A standardized form will be used by the nurse to identify criteria of possible wound infection (erythema, purulence, induration, fever, pain, fluctuance, dehiscence). A wound suspected to be infected by the presence of any of the previous criteria will immediately be evaluated by an emergency room physician to adjudicate on its infection status. An infected wound is defined as one requiring either drainage or antibiotic treatment based on the judgement of the physician.
The regional Medical Electronic Record will be reviewed for patients that were lost at follow up. Records of subsequent visits for wound infection will be looked for at 30 days post-repair.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aesthetic appearance of the laceration following repair</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days post-repair</time_frame>
    <description>The following question will be asked:
&quot;Considering the appearance and localisation of the laceration before repair, considering that complete healing of the laceration could take up to a year duration, and considering that sun exposure needs to be avoided during the healing period, are you satisfied with the appearance your laceration has today?&quot; Yes or No.</description>

    <description>A designated unblinded medical team member (nurse, emergency room physician or resident/trainee uninvolved in that particular patient's care) will prepare the laceration for repair and perform the irrigation. Irrigation will be delivered through a 20 Gauge 1 inch long catheter mounted on a 60 millilitre syringe. The volume of normal saline used will be calculated as 60 millilitre per centimetre length of laceration for a maximum of 300 millilitre. Once completed, the treating physician will enter the room and proceed to the laceration closure with the method and equipment of his choice. Both the patient (through eye covering) and the treating physician will remain blinded to the intervention.</description>

    <description>A designated unblinded medical team member (nurse, emergency room physician or resident/trainee uninvolved in that particular patient's care) will prepare the laceration for repair. The laceration will not directly be irrigated. In order to ensure blinding of the subjects, the surrounding of the wound will be irrigated with a total of 60 millilitre of normal saline delivered through a 20 Gauge 1 inch long catheter mounted on a 60 millilitre syringe. Care will be taken not to enter a margin of 5cm from the laceration edges. Once completed, the treating physician will enter the room and proceed to the laceration closure with the method and equipment of his choice. Both the patient (through eye covering) and the treating physician will remain blinded to the intervention.</description>
