      This is a Phase 2 study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SFX-01 when used in
      combination with aromatase inhibitors (AIs), tamoxifen and fulvestrant.

      Patients will be enrolled into one of three study arms (SFX-01 in combination with AI,
      tamoxifen or fulvestrant) based on their current therapy.

      The trial is a phase 2, parallel group design in patients with ER positive metastatic breast
      cancer.

      This study will be a multicentre study conducted over an 18 month period. Patients who are
      taking either a third generation AI, tamoxifen or fulvestrant and have a documented evidence
      of progressive disease after achieving a best response of stable disease (for at least 6
      months) or an objective response of CR or PR on the current treatment indicating the
      development of secondary resistance to current therapy will be entered into the study having
      undergone a screening period to continue receiving the same treatment with the addition of
      SFX-01.

      At least 60 patients will be enrolled into one of three arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, i.e. 20
      patients per arm. Enrolment will be based on current treatment.

      Treatment Arm A: All patients will continue to receive their AI and, at the start of the
      study (D1), patients will additionally take SFX-01.

      Treatment Arm B: All patients will continue to receive tamoxifen and, at the start of the
      study (D1), patients will additionally take SFX-01

      Treatment Arm C: All patients will continue to receive fulvestrant 500 mg IM in 28 day Cycles
      and, at the start of the study (D1), patients will additionally take SFX-01.

      Patient participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up
      Phase of up to 28 weeks post D1 of dosing. The Screening Phase will be up to 28 days prior to
      enrolment. The Treatment Phase will extend from enrolment until the patient is discontinued
      from study treatment. The Follow-up Phase will be a maximum of 28 weeks and extend from the
      time of study entry until 30 days after the patient discontinues trial therapy.

         10. Diagnosed or treated for a malignancy other than breast cancer within 1 year, or who
             were previously diagnosed with a malignancy other than breast cancer and have any
             radiographic or biochemical marker evidence of malignancy. Patients with completely
             resected basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ
             malignancy (other than breast) are not excluded.

         11. Concurrent treatment with another investigational agent or participated in another
