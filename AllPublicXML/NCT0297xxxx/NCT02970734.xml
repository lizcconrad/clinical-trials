  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a common mental health problem for Canadian adolescents. Anxiety that is diagnosed
      as a disorder and serious enough to require treatment affects up to 10% of all adolescents by
      the age of 16. The median age of onset is 11 years, making these disorders some of the
      earliest to develop. Anxiety disorders can have serious negative effects on a young person's
      personal relationships, school performance, and family life. These disorders may not be
      discovered by adolescents, parents and health care providers. Even if anxiety disorders are
      discovered, adolescents may not get the right therapy. Anxious adolescents can become sick if
      their anxiety is not treated properly. The investigators will carry out research to test
      Breathe, an Internet-based treatment for adolescents with anxiety problems. Adolescents can
      use this treatment from home via the computer. Breathe will include information materials and
      personalized homework assignments to help anxious adolescents learn ways to manage anxiety.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two groups, an Internet-delivered
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experimental group (Breathe) and a resource webpage
      (control group; considered treatment as usual for youth waiting for services). The
      investigators will evaluate several methodological processes and outcomes through the
      following objectives:

        1. To determine the effectiveness of a self-guided Internet-based CBT program with limited
           telephone and email support in reducing anxiety symptoms among adolescents with
           mild-to-moderate anxiety as compared to a usual self-help intervention, a resource-based
           webpage.

        2. To explore mediators and moderators of the Internet-based CBT program.

        3. To determine the effectiveness of a self-guided Internet-based CBT program in improving
           quality of life as compared to a usual self-help intervention.

        4. To determine adherence to a self-guided Internet-based CBT program.

        5. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the Internet-based CBT program.

    <description>Developed by the investigators, this electronically administered, self-report instrument will assess participant satisfaction (e.g., ease of use, layout, convenience) perceived credibility and impact (e.g., helpfulness, knowledge gains, confidence in the program/website), and adherence and usage (e.g., barriers and facilitators to treatment) with an Internet-based program/webpage.</description>

    <measure>Intervention adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-baseline (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention adherence will be measured by documenting the number of sessions and homework tasks completed. The investigators will also record the number of tailored sessions completed by each participant (intervention condition) and site visits (control condition). These data will be collected through the intervention's software system.</description>
