    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a subject operated device to lessen tinnitus
      (ringing in the ear), based on subject-feedback for stimulus presentation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consented 35 adult subjects. 21 subjects qualified and were randomized into the
      study. This project will develop and test a device with the ultimate goal of providing a
      patient operated device to alleviate phantom sound perception, or tinnitus, based on
      patient-feedback for stimulus presentation.

      The device, an electrical-acoustical stimulus timing, is based on physiological findings of
      stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory and auditory nuclei,that when aberrant,
      contribute to tinnitus.

    <measure>Change in TFI (Tinnitus Functional Index) After Treatment or Sham Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks on treatment (or sham)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in TFI score (mean of weekly assessments for 4 weeks) from baseline for treatment and sham groups. TFI is a clinical questionnaire that assesses tinnitus impact on a subject's quality of life. It uses a scale of 0 - 100 where 0 means no negative impact on quality of life from tinnitus and 100 is devastating impact It will be administered weekly through out the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Loudness as Assessed by TinnTester</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks on treatment (or sham)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Tinnitus matching loudness score (mean of weekly assessments for 4 weeks) from baseline tinnitus matching loudness score, for treatment and sham groups. Subjects are guided through a self-directed computerized assessment software that estimates how loud (in decibels) they perceive their tinnitus to be (TinnTester). This measure was performed at baseline, as well as time points following active, washout, or sham periods.</description>

          <title>Tinnitus Loudness</title>
          <description>Tinnitus matching loudness score at baseline assessment. Subjects are guided through a self-directed computerized assessment software that estimates how loud (in decibels/dB) they perceive their tinnitus to be (TinnTester). This measure will be performed at baseline, as well as time points following active, washout, or sham periods.</description>

        <description>Change in TFI score (mean of weekly assessments for 4 weeks) from baseline for treatment and sham groups. TFI is a clinical questionnaire that assesses tinnitus impact on a subject's quality of life. It uses a scale of 0 - 100 where 0 means no negative impact on quality of life from tinnitus and 100 is devastating impact It will be administered weekly through out the study.</description>
