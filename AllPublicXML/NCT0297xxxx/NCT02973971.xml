  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present single center clinical chronobiological study on 24 subjects (12 patients with
      mild to moderate form of Alzheimer's disease and 12 Healthy subjects) aims at characterizing
      the ADDIA biomarkers: a) blood cell‐based biomarkers measured by flow cytometry using
      proprietary probes specific of two targeted biomarkers, beta‐Amyloid (Aβ) peptide and a
      kinase, and b) circulating biomarkers in peripheral body fluids. The biomarkers will be
      analyzed on samples taken at different time points of the day, including under fasting and
      non-fasting conditions and at two periods: day 1 and day 14.

          -  Total expected completed subjects: 24.

          -  Stratification by gender: 6 males and 6 females, age-matched healthy subjects and 6
             males and 6 females, age‐matched Alzheimer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria for Alzheimer patient group:

          -  Signed Informed Consent.

          -  Male or female subject, between 55 and 85 years inclusive.

          -  Specific clinical phenotype of AD: Presence of an early and significant episodic
             memory impairment (isolated or associated with other cognitive or behavioural changes
             that are suggestive of a dementia syndrome) that includes the following:

               -  Gradual and progressive change in memory function reported by patient or
                  informant over more than 6 months.

               -  Objective evidence of an amnesic syndrome of hippocampal type, based on
                  significantly impaired performance on an episodic memory test with established
                  specificity for mild to moderate AD.

          -  Cognitive tests including MMSE score 12 ≤ MMSE ≤ 25 for mild to moderate AD (measured
             in the last 3 months), b) Scores of other tests routinely practiced at the hospital
             for measurement of memory and cognition shall be compatible with mild to moderate AD.

          -  Neuroimaging compatible with a diagnosis of mild to moderate AD.

          -  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers showing at least 2 positive levels out of the 3
             biomarkers: CSF Aβ1‐42 and tau (Phosphorylated‐Tau and/or Total‐Tau). CSF collection
             and data being only retrospective.

        Inclusion Criteria for healthy controls:

          -  Signed Informed Consent.

          -  Male or female subject, between 55 and 85 years inclusive.

          -  Normal clinical and cognitive scores as measured using standard neuropsychological
             tests.

          -  Normal scores in other neuropsychological tests routinely practiced at the hospital
             for measurement of memory and cognition.

          -  No abnormal neuroimaging findings in at least structural MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject who did not sign the informed consent form.

          -  Any chronic neurodegenerative disease (vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease,
             Creutzfeldt Jacob, Huntington's disease, etc.), acute neurodegenerative disease
             (stroke), history or presence of clinically relevant psychiatric history
             (schizophrenia, psychosis), some chronic inflammatory diseases that impact blood cells
             (e.g. anemia of inflammation and chronic disease) and some cancers (that impact blood
             cells: e.g. leukemia), major sensory deficits that could interfere with cognitive
             assessment (visual and auditory), epilepsy.

          -  Frequent headaches and/or migraine, recurrent nausea and/or vomiting (more than twice
             a month).

          -  Blood donation, any volume, within 2 months before inclusion.
