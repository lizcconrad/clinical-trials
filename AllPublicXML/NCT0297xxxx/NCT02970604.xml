  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks and strokes are common causes of death worldwide. These events occur in part,
      due to increased activity of platelets, which cause clotting (thrombosis) within heart and
      brain blood vessels.

      Anti-platelet therapies (e.g. aspirin) reduce the likelihood of platelet thrombosis and
      therefore protect against heart attacks and strokes. However serious bleeding into the gut
      and brain occurs in a number of individuals prescribed aspirin. Currently, there is no
      reliable method for assessing the relative risks of thrombosis versus bleeding in individual
      patients prior to or during aspirin therapy.

      We have recently discovered that individuals with a particular genetic make-up, those with
      genetic variants in two genes called PPARGC1β and CNTN4, demonstrate more active (sticky)
      platelets. We then found that these same individuals suffered a greater number of
      cardiovascular events. Interestingly, low dose aspirin suppressed the excessive platelet
      stickiness and protected against heart attacks and strokes in these patients.

      In this project, we aim to confirm and extend the above findings. We hope that testing for
      PPARGC1β and CNTN4 genetic variants will allow us to identify which patients will benefit
      from low dose aspirin therapy - i.e. receive protection from heart attacks and strokes, but
      not suffer any bleeding complications.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent, and to comply with
             the requirements of this study protocol.

          -  Subjects must be at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk as determined by a
             calculated 5 year CVD risk of 5% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson
             Framingham risk equation with adjustments as defined by the New Zealand Guidelines
             Group recommendations)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years.

          -  Previous MI, stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or known CAD.

          -  Subjects who have any other significant disease or disorder (including concurrent
             malignancy) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at
             risk by participation in the study, or may influence the result of the study.

          -  Known history of, or documented positive hepatitis B or C or HIV infection

          -  AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN.

          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 60 mL/min measured by 24-hour urine collection or

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding or considering becoming pregnant
             during the study, or with childbearing potential without using a medically accepted
             method of contraception (see notes 1-5 below)

          -  Patients already taking aspirin.

                  inhibitors (e.g. certain asthma patients who may suffer an attack or faint and
                  certain patients who may suffer from bronchospasm, rhinitis and urticaria) and to
