    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy of the ResAppDx software
      application in diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory conditions (bronchiolitis,
      asthma/reactive airway disease, croup, upper or lower respiratory tract infections) in
      infants and children. Patient's cough sounds will be recorded using a smartphone and analysed
      using the ResAppDx software. The ResAppDx diagnosis will be compared to radiologic diagnosis
      and/or clinical diagnosis. The ResAppDx diagnosis will not be provided to the clinician or
      patient.
