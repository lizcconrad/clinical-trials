      This study has designed, implemented and evaluated an intervention to promote healthy
      lifestyles in children addressing the development of the social and emotional competence.
      This research followed the first three stages of the Medical Research Council framework for
      complex interventions: the theoretical, modeling phase and the exploratory trial. A
      randomised control trial with 37 children (5 y 6 years old) was conducted at the exploratory
      trial. The first unit was implemented in 8 sessions. A multi-method and multi-informant
      approach was used to assess the preliminary efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of the
      programme.
