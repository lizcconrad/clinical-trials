  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional descriptive study, in which the surface electromyographic activity of five
      shoulder muscles was compared in three populations: older adults, middle-aged adults and
      young adults. The evaluation of the electromyographic data offers a suitable foundation to
      understand aging process.

      This supports that surface electromyography provide information about the aged shoulder
      muscles. Loss of functionality is suffered by a high percentage of older adults, which
      greatly limits their physical activity. In this sense, this paper presents findings that
      might be related with possible therapeutic approaches in subsequent studies.

      The purpose of the present work was to assess neuromotor abnormalities in aging shoulder.
      Twenty young adults (20-42), 20 middle-aged adults (43-67) and 20older adults (&gt;68) were
      recruited. A comparative electromyography (EMG) study was performed on the upper and lower
      trapezius, middle deltoid, infraspinatus and serratus anterior. The EMG measurement (root
      mean square (RMS)) and onset time of isometric contractions were analyzed. Body mass index
      and strength were also tested.
