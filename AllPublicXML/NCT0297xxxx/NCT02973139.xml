    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to compare two currently
      accepted standard-of-care treatment strategies: Medical thoracoscopy as compared to
      instillation of intrapleural tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) and human recombinant
      Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for the management of empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion
      (CPPE) in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pleural infection (empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion (CPPE)) represents
      one of the most common clinical diagnoses encountered in clinical practice in the United
      States (US) It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite advances in
      medical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

      Objective: Compare two standard of care treatments: TPA/DNase vs early medical Thoracoscopy

      Methods: We will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial. We plan to enroll a total
      of 80 patients and randomize them to either Medical Thoracoscopy group or Fibrinolytic
      Therapy group.

      Follow-up will be daily until hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 weeks in the outpatient
      setting

      Primary Outcome: Duration of hospital stay after intervention

      Secondary Outcome: Failure rate of assigned treatment and adverse events

      Potential Outcome and Benefit: Determine best strategy for treating patients with pleural
      infection
