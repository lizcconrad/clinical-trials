      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib, compared to the best
      supportive care (BSC), in two cohorts of patients who presented with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) based on etiology of hepatitis C virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Egypt, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection occurs in around 10% of the population
      (about 8 million individuals), and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and mortality. Although HCV genotype 4 constitutes about 20% of HCV infections
      worldwide, the prevalence in Egypt is more than 90%.(Waked et al., 2016)

      In 2014 Omar et al. reviewed 41 patients in a study to evaluate Sorafenib for Egyptian
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma at a median follow up period of 13 months,
      the median PFS for the whole group was 4 months; the median OS for the whole group is 6.25
      months.(Abdel-Rahman et al., 2014)

      Till current, no studies have evaluated the Sorafenib efficacy in comparison to the best
      supportive care treatment in HCC patients whose etiology from HCV genotype 4 ( the most
      prevalent hepatitis C virus genotype in Egypt).

      So, The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib, compared to the best supportive
      care (BSC), in two cohorts of patients who presented with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) based on etiology of hepatitis C virus.
