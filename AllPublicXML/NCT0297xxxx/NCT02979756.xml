  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A situational analysis on gestational diabetes conducted in 2015 in two districts in Morocco
      revealed difficulties in accessing screening for gestational diabetes (GDM) and delays in
      receiving appropriate care. Based on the results of the situational analysis, the
      investigators developed this proposal in close collaboration with the Moroccan research group
      on gestational diabetes composed of representatives of the Ministry of Health, researchers,
      members of professional organizations and specialists in the domains of endocrinology,
      gynecology, neonatal health and nutrition. The investigators opted for an hybrid
      implementation effectiveness trial to evaluate both clinical effectiveness of the proposed
      screening and initial management strategy and its implementation at the first level of care.

      The objectives of this study are thus to evaluate the feasibility of a decentralized strategy
      of screening for GDM and the initialization of GDM treatment already through the primary
      level of care and to assess its potential for scaling-up. Specific objectives of this study
      are to augment universal access to screening and management of gestational diabetes and to
      increase the competencies of health care providers at first level health care facilities to
      detect, start initial treatment and to improve follow-up of affected women. By comparing
      active screening and treatment initiation through first line health facilities with the
      existing practices, the investigators would like to explore the effect of the new model on
      maternal and newborn outcomes such as weight gain in pregnancy, occurrence of delivery
      complications and birth weight. The investigators will further assess the acceptability of
      screening and initial management of GDM through first line health services by health care
      providers and by pregnant women diagnosed with GDM and the impact of two different screening
      approaches on the lifestyle of affected mothers.

    <description>In this arm, the intervention consists of screening all pregnant women for GDM using the nationally recommended oral glucose tolerance test that will take place during antenatal care consultations in 10 randomly selected primary health care facilities. Overall, 80 women who are diagnosed with GDM and who consent to participate will receive initial nutritional counseling and will be closely followed up.</description>
