  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of EWS scores, number of automated notifications and serious events performed
      on a general ward is contingent on the quality and frequency of vital signs measurement like
      respiratory rate. This is due to the EWS escalation schemes of hospitals with an acute
      intervention team. Obtained sub-score trigger levels of vital signs contribute to higher and
      more frequent scoring.

      We examine the influence of different respiration rate sensor concepts and measurements on
      scoring (NEWS and CREWS) and workflow in a typical UK gastroenterology and respiratory ward.

        The investigators plan to observe a non-probability, convenience sample of patients which
        will consist primarily of acutely ill hospitalized adult patients (at least 18 years of
        age). Study participants will be recruited from all eligible patients during the enrollment
        period who are having vital signs monitoring performed as Standard of Care.
