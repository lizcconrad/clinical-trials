      Corroboratory behavioral evidence showed interaction effects between vestibular stimulation
      and egocentric transformation.

      The investigators here examine in healthy participants, whether there are shared brain
      mechanisms underlying galvanic vestibular stimulation, illusory self-motion and egocentric
      transformation, as well as their interaction.

      It is hypothesized that the GVS induced illusory self-motion dampens the ability to perform
      egocentric mental transformation.

      Theories of embodied mental rotation suggest overlapping processes between real body and
      egocentric mental transformations. Corroboratory behavioral evidence showed interaction
      effects between vestibular stimulation and egocentric transformation. Yet, no study so far
      has investigated which cortical areas are involved in vestibular processing and/or illusory
      self-motion and mental transformation tasks within the same participants. This however seems
      crucial, as important individual differences exist for both mental transformation abilities
      as well as in subjective perception of artificial vestibular stimulation.

      The primary objective is to reveal which brain area(s) are involved in the interaction of
      illusory self-motion (as induced by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS)) and egocentric
      mental transformation, as compared to no illusory self-motion or object-based mental
      transformation. It is hypothesized that the GVS induced illusory self-motion dampens the
      ability to perform egocentric mental transformation more than object-based mental
      transformation.

      As previous behavioral studies on such an interaction were always done in a sitting position,
      a secondary objective is to first replicate previous behavioral mental rotation studies that
      used GVS, in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) -scanner comparable setting. Moreover, as no brain
      imaging study so far has investigated subjective illusory motion experience induced by GVS,
      illusory self-motion will be measured and included in the statistical model to find specific
      brain regions modulating the illusory self-motion perception.

    <description>A standard placement of the electrodes will be used for GVS and sham, placed on the mastoids. Weak currents up to maximally 3 mA will be used (tested before in each participant individually, and expected mean current will be around 1.5 mA). Previous studies have used Magnetic Resonance (MR) compatible GVS without reporting any discomfort for the participants, however weak sensations of nausea could be possible and in case that they are disturbing for the participants the experiment will be aborted. Continuous stimulation for up to 30min with intensities of 1-1.5 mA is generally considered as safe and free of any considerable side effects.</description>

    <description>The investigators aim to study the influence of Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation on the brain mechanisms underlying illusory self-motion and its influence on egocentric mental transformation. As a control condition sham stimulation will be applied by the same device within the same participants in different trials. Participants should not note the difference.</description>
