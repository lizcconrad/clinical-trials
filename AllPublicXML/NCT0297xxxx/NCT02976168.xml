  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to understand the relationship between intracranial pressure
      regulation, cerebral tissue oxygenation and cognitive functioning. More specifically, the
      study tests the hypothesis that head down tilt will increase intracranial pressure (not
      measured in this study, but demonstrated in previous studies), will induce venous congestion
      and facial swelling, decrease intracranial tissue oxygenation and hamper brain functioning.
      The objectives of the study therefore are to assess young healthy people during head-down
      tilt (HDT), and to assess cognitive brain functioning, cerebral tissue oxygenation
      (non-invasively), frontal skin thickness, cerebral perfusion and neuronal functioning via
      event-related potentials.
