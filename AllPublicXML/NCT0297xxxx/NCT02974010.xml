      NeuroRx is developing NRX-101, a fixed-dose combination oral capsule composed of
      d-cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone for the maintenance of remission from Acute Suicidal
      Ideation (C-SSRS level 4 or 5) and Behavior (ASIB) in adults with Bipolar Depression
      following initial stabilization. Patients with Bipolar Depression and ASIB will be recruited
      in both inpatient and outpatient settings and, following informed consent, will be given an
      intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes. Those who exhibit a satisfactory
      clinical response to ketamine will be randomly allocated to NRX-101 or to a comparator group.
      The primary outcome variable is time to relapse as defined by a return to baseline in either
      depression or suicidality as determined by the treating physician or the need to institute a
      new treatment plan.

      NeuroRx is developing NRX-101, a fixed-dose combination oral capsule composed of
      d-cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone for the maintenance of remission from Acute Suicidal
      Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in adults with Bipolar Depression following initial
      stabilization. The proposed oral combination product is intended to be administered as part
      of a sequential therapy consisting of the following 2 components:

        1. an initial, one-time intravenous (iv) infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg administered over
           40 min), followed one day later by

        2. twice daily oral capsules of NRX 101 (DCS + lurasidone), dosing of which is initiated 1
           day after ketamine administration, titrated over 5 days to a maintenance dose and
           continued for up to 6 weeks. Each NRX-101 oral capsule contains DCS (237.5 or 175.0 mg)
           and lurasidone (8.25, 16.5, or 33.0 mg). It is anticipated that subjects entering the
           study will be receiving concurrent disorder-directed treatment with various predefined
           combinations of medications. This treatment regime will be maintained upon entry into
           the study. However, any use of lurasidone, quetiapine, or olanzapine will be stopped at
           study entry, so as to avoid either duplication with study drug (groups 1 and 2) or
           undermining of the control group.

      The clinical efficacy goal is to provide extended relief from symptoms associated with ASIB
      in adults with Bipolar Disorder, and allow effective treatment with NRX-101 dosing initiated
      one day (24 hours) after initial stabilization with iv ketamine in a clinic, emergency
      department, or inpatient setting. NRX-101 contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredients
      (APIs) as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral products Seromycin
      (Cycloserine Capsules, USP; ANDA 060593; Purdue GMP) and Latuda (lurasidone HCL) tablets for
      oral administration (NDA 200603; Sunovion Pharma, Inc.).

      The proposed NRX-101 product takes advantage of a unique synergistic confluence of 2 approved
      medications with long histories of safety following the administration of a single dose of
      ketamine. All components of this treatment are currently FDA-approved for use in conditions
      other than ASIB. The goals of combining these drugs into a single course of treatment is to
      maximize the beneficial effects of the specific subcomponents while overcoming potential
      treatment-limiting side effects associated with those subcomponents. Beneficial effects of
      the proposed dosage regimen include 1) well-documented pharmacodynamic effects of ketamine in
      treating both persistent depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in bipolar disorder
      (McCloud, 2015; Naughton, 2014; Newport, 2015; Price, 2014), 2) well-documented
      pharmacodynamic effects of oral DCS against persistent symptoms of depression (Heresco-Levy,
      2013) and 3) the FDA-approved efficacy of lurasidone in treatment-resistant depression
      (Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, 2013). Due to the synergistic effects, the proposed NRX-101
      combination capsule is also expected to avoid or minimize the significant undesired adverse
      effects associated with the usage of these drugs as single agents (eg, negative consequences
      of repeated use of ketamine (JHP Pharmaceuticals, 2012), potential psychotomimetic effects of
      long-term treatment with DCS alone (Kantrowitz, 2010) and potential akathisia and
      susceptibility for increased suicidality associated with lurasidone alone (Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals, 2013).

      The risk of ASIB is higher in bipolar depression than other psychiatric disorder and the
      majority of currently available antidepressants are contraindicated for patients with bipolar
      depression. NeuroRx believes that the proposed NRX-101 treatment regimen (ketamine
      administration followed by NRX-101) will demonstrate superiority over ketamine followed by
      lurasidone and over ketamine alone in delaying the time to documented relapse from depression
      in bipolar disorder, providing a new treatment option for ASIB patients.

      There is currently no FDA-approved product for the treatment of ASIB. NeuroRx proposes that
      NRX-101 will fulfill an urgent medical need for safe and effective treatment for ASIB.

      Patients with Bipolar Depression and ASIB will be recruited in both inpatient and outpatient
      settings and, following informed consent, will be given an intravenous infusion of ketamine
      0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes. Those who exhibit a satisfactory clinical response to ketamine will
      be randomly allocated to NRX-101 or to a comparator group. The primary outcome variable is
      time to relapse as defined by a return to baseline in either depression or suicidality as
      determined by the treating physician or the need to institute a new treatment plan.

                       contraceptives, IUD, double-barrier contraception, sexual abstinence. The
                       form of birth control will be documented at screening and baseline.

          8. Body mass index between 18-35 kg/m2.
