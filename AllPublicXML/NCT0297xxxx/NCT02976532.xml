  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the use of electromagnetic tracking in femoral derotation
      osteotomies. The goal is to raise the precision of the surgical procedure in order to improve
      the outcome in short- and long term. The electromagnetic tracking system is evaluated against
      a base line CT scan serving as reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internal rotation gait is a common deformity in children, especially in those with spastic
      diplegia. The treatment includes soft tissue and bony correction. Especially the bony
      procedures e.g. femoral derotation osteotomies have proven to be effective both in short term
      and long term evaluation. Nonetheless there is still a relevant number of patients that
      suffer from over- or under-correction and recurrence over time. The reasons are diverse and
      include false measurement of the derotation in OR.

      The study now evaluates electromagnetic tracking for femoral derotation to improve these
      results.

      The patients are recruited from the outpatients department and included if they meet the
      criteria.

      A baseline rotational CT scan and a 3-D-gait analysis are performed and the derotation
      measured with the EMT system in OR. The results of the measurement is invisible and unknown
      to the surgeon as the system unit is controlled by a technician.

      The surgical procedure follows standard rules and does not need alterations because of the
      study.

      After the operation a second rotational CT scan is performed and the derotation precisely
      evaluated by two raters and later compared to the results of the electromagnetic tracking
      system.

    <description>The study evaluates the result of the derotation measurement by the EMT system against the derotation in degrees that is measured with the difference between the pre- and the post-operative CT scan (meaning: EMT measurement intra-operative versus difference in femoral rotation in the CT scan between pre- and post-operative CT). The outcome is given in degrees.</description>
