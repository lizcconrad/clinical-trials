  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ratiotherapy alone is the current standard treatment for elderly esophageal or
      esophagogastric cancer in China. And Little is known about chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in elderly
      patients. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and safety of simultaneous integrated
      boost (SIB) intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with S1 based SIB-IMRT followed by
      adjuvant chemotherapy with S1 in in elderly (age ≥70 years) esophageal or esophagogastric
      cancer patients
