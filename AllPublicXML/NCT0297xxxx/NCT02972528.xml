    <textblock>
      In this study, allogenic, defibrinated platelet rich plasma lysate will be used as a direct
      injection into the periphery of diabetic chronic foot ulcers which have not healed using
      standard of care. Investigators anticipate a significant response in treated individuals
      measured by the percentage of skin restoration achieved.
