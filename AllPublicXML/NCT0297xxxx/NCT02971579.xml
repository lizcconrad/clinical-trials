      This is a prospective observational longitudinal study

      Aim of the study is to collect information:

        -  on the organization models of the Endoscopic Units performing ERCP in Italy

        -  on the previous and/or ongoing training of the endoscopists performing ERCP

        -  on the clinical characteristics of patients undergoing ERCP in Italy as well as on the
           outcome

      Quality of ERCP in Italy has been object of various, mainly retrospective studies in Italy,
      but it has never systematically and prospectively evaluated in a large prospective series.

      Moreover, the study aim at collecting data on the organization models of the Endoscopic Units
      performing ERCP in Italy; on the previous and/or ongoing training of the endoscopists
      performing ERCP; on the clinical characteristics of patients undergoing ERCP in Italy as well
      as on the outcome of the procedure

      The study consists of 3 phases:

        1. Collection of the information on the Endoscopic Unit and on the endoscopists who
           performed ERCP in the center

        2. Collection of data regarding consecutive ERCPs performed in adult patients in each
           center including demographic, clinical and procedural information

        3. Definition of the the outcome of ERCP assessed after 30 days from the procedure
