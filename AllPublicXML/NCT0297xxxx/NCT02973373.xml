  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the benefit on image quality of MRI of the chest
      performed under high frequency non-invasive ventilation. This technique indeed allows to
      generate an apnea duration of several minutes with acquisitions performed at full
      inspiration. This study will be applied on healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High frequency ventilation (HF-V) has been applied by using a non-invasive interface allowing
      to obtain a prolonged apnea in awaken subjects. Such an application should be of interest for
      MRI taking into account its susceptibility to motion of the chest and the imperfect
      techniques of respiratory gating that are usually performed at end expiration. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the benefit on image quality of different sequences performed with
      and without the device in healthy subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Image quality assessment (soapbubble, maximum of first derivative, signal to noise, contrast to noise)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 weeks after MRI acquisition</time_frame>
    <description>Image quality and artefacts will be evaluated and compared without and with the device. Sharpness of the interfaces between vessels and lung will be evaluated with the Soapbubble software (Etienne et al., Magn Reson Med. 2002 Oct;48(4):658-66). The interface between diaphragm and lung will be evaluated with the maximum of the first derivative (Tibiletti et al., Magn Reson Med. 2016 Mar;75(3):1324-32). Signal to noise and contrast to noise will be measured within regions of interest in the image.</description>

    <measure>Heart and coronary arteries evaluation (soapbubble, signal to noise, contrast to noise)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 weeks after MRI acquisition</time_frame>
    <description>The potential benefit on the exploration of the heart and coronary arteries will be assessed. Sharpness of the coronary arteries with respect to the neighbouring tissue will be evaluated with the Soapbubble software (Etienne et al., Magn Reson Med. 2002 Oct;48(4):658-66). Signal to noise and contrast to noise will be measured within regions of interest in the image.</description>

    <description>The possibility of synchronizing the MRI acquisition with the ventilation system will be explored with the aim to eliminate residual diaphragmatic motion and evaluate the potential additional benefit in terms of image quality and artefacts will be evaluated.</description>
