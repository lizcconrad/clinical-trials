      In this trial, treatment efficacy and safety of Poziotinib will be assessed in patients with
      stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring HER2 mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to be multi-center, open-label, single-arm, prospective, phase II
      trial of patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with HER2 mutation who have not received
      prior EGFR-TKI. Approximately 47 patients will be enrolled into the trial, and expected study
      duration is 36 months from IRB and Korea: MFDS approval date.

      The study drug(poziotinib) will be administered orally as one 12 mg tablet once a day until
      disease progression or manifestation of unacceptable toxicity. The initial dose of the study
      drug 12 mg daily can be reduced to 8 mg once daily according to dose reduction criteria in
      protocol. A cycle of study treatment is defined as 28 days.
