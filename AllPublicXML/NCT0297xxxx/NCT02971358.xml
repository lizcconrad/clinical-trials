  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among men and the second leading
      cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. In 2013, it is estimated that 29,270 men
      have died from prostate cancer. Although radiation and surgery are quite effective for
      localized disease, there is no effective cure for men who present with metastatic prostate
      cancer as the 5-year relative survival rate is only 28%.

      Currently, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) via medical or surgical castration is the
      standard first-line therapy in men with metastatic disease but castration-recurrent prostate
      cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges with a median time of 18-24 months. Once CRPC develops,
      secondary hormonal manipulation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are marginally effective.

      Given the dismal prognosis of metastatic prostate cancer, new ideas and novel approaches must
      be explored to improve the clinical outcome. In this regard, recently emerging data suggest
      that local tumor control may enhance the effectiveness of subsequent systemic therapies.
      Therefore, in this proposal, the investigators have designed a Phase I/II study in which they
      will prospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of cytoreductive prostatectomy in men
      with newly diagnosed mPCa.
