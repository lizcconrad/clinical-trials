      The study wants to compare ESWL alone with ESWL and endoscopic drainage of the MPD for
      treatment of pain in chronic pancreatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination mode of ESWL and ERCP is an established method of treatment of painful
      obstructive calcified chronic pancreatitis. However, the investigators notice that patients
      after ESWL alone in calcified CP is followed by spontaneous elimination of stone fragments
      and pain relief. Inui reported that 40% of 555 patients spontaneous eliminate stone
      fragments. Dumonceau found that combining systematic endoscopy with ESWL adds to the cost of
      patient care, without improving the outcome of the pancreatic pain.

      So the investigators design such a prospective and randomized controlled trial. People
      diagnosed with uncomplicated painful chronic pancreatitis and calcifications obstructing the
      MPD will be randomly assigned to the ESWL or endoscopy group according to a table of random
      numbers.

      ESWL will be performed in all patients using a electromagnetic lithotriptor. ESWL sessions
      will be repeated if necessary, until stone fragmentation is obtained. Patients in the
      endoscopy group will undergo endoscopy in 48 hours with possible stent insertion. In the ESWL
      group, if pain continues or aggravates, endoscopic drainage of the MPD will be carried out.

      Follow-up will consists of telephone interview1 after treatment and clinical examination
      every 6 months thereafter. Data collected will include clinical presentation, ESWL,
      endoscopic and surgical procedures, life quality. In addition, S-MRCP will be performed 6
      months after treatment. Blood glucose, insulin, stool elastase will be taken each clinical
      examination.

    <measure>Change from baseline pain score as accessed by izbichi pain score at 12 month</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whether pain is relieved depends on the change of Izbicki pain score at the baseline and 12 months after the procedure(ERCP alone or ERCP combined with ERCP). Izbicki pain score is composed of 4 parts, that is frequency of pain attacks(daily counts for 100, several times a week counts for 75, several times a month counts for 50, several times a year counts for 25 and several times a year counts for 0), VAS(subjective evaluation of pain by patients from no pain which is 0 points to imaginative maximum of pain which is 100 points), analgesic medication(morphine consumption is 100, buprenorphine is 80, pethidine is 20, tramaldol is 15, metamizole is 3 and acetylsalicylacid is 1) and time of disease-related inability to work(permanet is 100, ≤1 month is 50, ≤1 week is 25 and no inability to work during the last year is 0). Each part counts for 100 points in all.</description>

    <measure>exocrine function of the pancreas through determination of fecal elastase as assessed by fecal elastase kit</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pancreatic exocrine function insufficiency(PEI) is defined as fecal elastase ＜200 μg/g. The result wii be divided into 4 conditions, that is exocrine function normal, PEI develop, PEI resolve, PEI persist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clearance of pancreatic stones</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of pancreatic stone is regarded as complete when clearance rate is more than 90%, partial is regarded as 50% to 90%, the rest is unsuccessful.</description>
