    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that inhaled therapies for chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have differential effects on the upper airway
      microbiome.

      COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Exacerbations drive disease progression
      and worsening quality of life and therefore prevention of exacerbations has been a major goal
      of treatment.

      Patients with COPD are frequently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) which have been
      shown to reduce exacerbations in combination with long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists
      (LABA). In recent years, all ICS preparations have been associated with a significant
      increased risk of pneumonia in either randomised trials or observational studies leading to
      warnings from national regulatory authorities and leading experts. This has led to a
      re-evaluation of the role of ICS in COPD treatments. It is likely that the risk of pneumonia
      is not equal across all ICS doses and molecules.

      There is a compelling rationale for ICS having a strong effect on the upper airway
      microbiome, and that this may be one mechanism of increased pneumonia risk with these drugs.
      The existing literature regarding ICS and pneumonia risk are lacking; 1) there are no head to
      head trials comparing different ICS preparations and 2) the comparator in these studies to
      date have been long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists alone, whereas the most appropriate
      comparator in current management would be combined LABA and long-acting muscarinic antagonist
      (LAMA).

      The MUSIC TRIAL is a multi-centre randomised open label controlled parallel group study with
      four treatment arms and a total of 120 participants. Severe COPD patients currently treated
      with inhaled corticosteroid therapy will be randomised to treatment with one of three
      preparations of ICS in combination with LABA or the control arm of dual bronchodilator
      therapy following a four week washout period. Participants will return monthly to determine
      if there are changes in the microbiome in their upper airway.

      This study will establish one potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to
      pneumonia in ICS users and assess intraclass differences in ICS molecules and the effect of
      ICS dose on the microbiome. Demonstrating that different COPD treatments can have different
      effects on the lung microbiome is an important step in understanding clinical differences in
      the safety and effectiveness of different treatments for severe COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), but their role in the management of COPD is currently being
      re-evaluated in light of new evidence and the emergence of alternative treatments. Studies
      have shown that the use of ICS and particularly ICS combined with long acting
      beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) in individuals with COPD reduces the frequency of COPD
      exacerbations and improves health status and lung function compared to LABA alone or placebo.
      The current National Institute for Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for COPD recommend ICS
      for patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second below 50% predicted, or for patients
      with higher lung function who have persisting symptoms or exacerbations despite treatment
      with long acting bronchodilators. Data suggests that up to 75% of patients with COPD in the
      United Kingdom (UK) are subsequently prescribed ICS.

      The daily dose of ICS utilised in COPD treatments are much higher than those used in asthma
      treatments, with licensed daily doses being 1000 mcg fluticasone propionate (2000 mcg
      beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalents) or 800 mcg budesonide (800 mcg BDP
      equivalents).

      Recent concerns have been expressed about the safety of ICS in COPD following several
      randomised controlled trials of fluticasone propionate and fluticasone furoate, among others,
      demonstrating an increase in rates of pneumonia as an adverse event. Several systematic
      reviews and observational studies confirm an association between ICS use and risk of
      pneumonia.

      All ICS preparations have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in either
      randomised trials or observational studies leading to warnings from national regulatory
      authorities and leading experts.

      It is likely however, that the risk of pneumonia is not equal across all ICS doses and
      molecules. Research into this area is greatly limited by the lack of head to head comparisons
      between different ICS preparations in COPD.

      It is hypothesised that the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of ICS lead to
      increase susceptibility to colonisation of the upper respiratory tract with pathogenic
      bacteria associated with pneumonia such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. This
      study will establish one potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to pneumonia in
      ICS users and assess intraclass differences in ICS molecules used in COPD and the effect of
      ICS dose. It is known that changes in the microbiome in COPD are associated with disease
      severity and with lung inflammation. Demonstrating that different COPD treatments can have
      different effects on the lung microbiome is an important step in understanding clinical
      differences in the safety and effectiveness of different treatments for severe COPD. The
      longer term clinical objective of this study is therefore to determine whether a proportion
      of patients with COPD might be more safely managed with either lower dose, pharmacologically
      different ICS preparations or with LABA/LAMA therapies to reduce the risk of pneumonia.

      Hypothesis Fluticasone propionate will facilitate a higher level of bacterial airway
      colonisation by pathogens associated with pneumonia compared to budesonide or treatment
      exclusively with bronchodilators, therefore providing a mechanistic explanation for increased
      pneumonia risk associated with ICS.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine a potential mechanism of inhaled corticosteroid associated
      pneumonia in COPD by demonstrating ICS effects on the upper (throat and nasal swabs) and
      lower airway (sputum) microbiome.

      To determine the mechanism of observed differences in pneumonia risk between fluticasone
      propionate, and budesonide by demonstrating differential effects on the airway microbiome.

             dental treatment for oral infection or poor dentition.

          -  Immunosuppression including current oral corticosteroids at a dose &gt;5mg for &gt;28 days.

          -  Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30ml/min/1.73meter squared or requiring
             dialysis. Last known eGFR result will be used .

          -  Use of any investigational drugs within five times of the elimination half-life after
             the last study dose or within 30 days, whichever is longer.

          -  Galactose intolerance

          -  Unstable co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, active malignancy) which in the
             opinion of the Investigator would make the patient unsuitable to be enrolled in the
             study. This includes any abnormality identified on screening bloods or screening
             electrocardiograph which in the opinion of the Investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  An exacerbation of COPD occurring during the screening to randomisation period. If
             this occurs the patient should be withdrawn from the study and may be rescreened once
             they have been free from corticosteroid and antibiotic treatment for 28 days. In these
             cases patients would receive the current Participant Information Sheet and be
             consented prior to starting the study from Visit 1.

          -  Documented that the patient has never received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination

          -  Receipt of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (e.g PCV-13)

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who are not practicing an acceptable method
             of contraception (see below)

        Acceptable forms of contraception:

          -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal

          -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral,
             injectable, implantable

          -  intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  intrauterine hormone-releasing system ( IUS)

          -  bilateral tubal occlusion
