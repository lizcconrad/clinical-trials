    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether remote ischemic conditioning(RIC) would
      reduce the stroke risk of patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar lesion of
      atherosclerosis,then we would observe the haemodynamics and plasma biomarkers changes.

    <description>Experimental: RIC group The upper limb ischemic conditioning is composed of five cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia intervened by reperfusion, which is induced by two cuff placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation. This therapy started within 1 month after stroke. In addition, all participants receive a standard clinical therapy.</description>
