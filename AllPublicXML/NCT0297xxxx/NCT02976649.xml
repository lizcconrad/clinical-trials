  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to propose a multi-dimensional score to predict those patients
      undergoing bariatric surgeries who will be in need for postoperative ICU admission.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-dimensional score of 7 risk factors was proposed which may help in identifying
      morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgeries who will need admission to a critical
      care unit postoperatively for follow up.
