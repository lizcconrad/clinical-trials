  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is being conducted to look at the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK; how the human body processes a substance) of ETX2514 when given to
      healthy volunteers intravenously as a single dose, and when given as multiple intravenous
      doses for up to 8 consecutive days.

      As it is anticipated that ETX2514 could be used as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii (a
      type of bacteria) infections, this project will also look at whether ETX2514 will interact
      with the current treatments for these infections when they are administered at the same time.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study
      investigates the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of single and multiple ascending doses
      of intravenous (IV) ETX2514 when administered intravenously alone and in combination with
      sulbactam and/or imipenem/cilastatin in healthy adult participants.

      The study will be conducted in four Parts: A, B, C, and D. Part A will explore the safety and
      tolerability of a single ascending dose (SAD) of IV ETX2514 over 8 cohorts. Part B will
      explore the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses (MAD) of IV ETX2514 over 4
      cohorts. Part C will explore the safety and tolerability of IV ETX2514 when administered as a
      single dose in combination with sulbactam (1.0 gram [g]) and/or imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g)
      to healthy participants over 2 cohorts. Part D will explore the safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of combined IV ETX2514/sulbactam (1.0 g)/imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g) to
      healthy participants.

             and less than or equal to 32.0 kg/m^2

          -  Clinical laboratory values within the normal limits as defined by the clinical
             laboratory, unless the Principal Investigator decides that out-of-range values are not
             clinically significant

          -  Negative screen for drugs of abuse, alcohol, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS Ag),
             hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at
             screening; and drugs of abuse, alcohol pre dose on Day -1

          -  Female participants must be of non-childbearing potential, or using a medically
             acceptable contraceptive regimen and must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening
             (serum) and on Day -1 (urine) prior to study drug dosing. Male participants must be
             surgically sterile, or using a medically acceptable contraceptive regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any

          -  Use of prescription or over the counter medications within 7 days of Investigational
             Product administration, with the exception of contraceptive medications, paracetamol,
             oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, topical over the counter preparations,
             and routine vitamins (if they do not exceed an intake of 20 to 600 times the
             recommended daily dose), unless agreed as non-clinically relevant by the Principal
             Investigator and Sponsor

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days before study
             drug dosing, i.e., there was at least 30 days in between the last dose on a prior
             study and dose administration on this study

          -  Current smoker, or difficulty abstaining from smoking for the duration of study
             confinement

          -  History of major organ dysfunction
