  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While significant progress has been made in the treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer,
      this progress has mostly shown benefits for younger women.

      This study aims to understand two things: How body composition (the amount of muscle and
      water versus fat in in the body) affects the dose and side effects of chemotherapy; and the
      biological reason for the worse prognosis with aging. To get a good view of these effects,
      investigators are asking the help of both younger and older women for this project.

Carboplatin will be sampled for on cycle 1 day 1 at predose and then at the end of the infusion, followed by 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 7.5 hours after the end of infusion, then on cycle 1 day 2 at 23.5 hours after the end of infusion.</description>

      <textblock>
        Female cancer patients age 18 years or older, with at least one third of the participants
        to be aged 70 years or more. Participants must have high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian,
        or peritoneal cancer, stage III or IV. Women and members of all races and ethnic groups are
        eligible for this trial. The study is not relevant to men.

        With a sample of 50 patients, investigators can detect a correlation as strong as 0.38
        between body composition and AUC of carboplatin and paclitaxel with a power of 0.80 at the
        significance level of 0.05. In order to allow for a 10% drop out/incompletion rate,
        investigators will accrue 55 participants.

             composition to carboplatin and paclitaxel.

          -  Known allergy to carboplatin, paclitaxel, or cremophor.

          -  Uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Women who are pregnant. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with carboplatin and paclitaxel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with carboplatin and
