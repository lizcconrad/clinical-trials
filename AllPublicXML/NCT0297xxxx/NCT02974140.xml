  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the refractive predictability (prediction error)
      between the Cataract Refractive Suite (CRS) and standard manual technique at one month
      post-operative

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of eyes in which the Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) at one month is ≤ 0.50 Diopter (D) relative to predicted MRSE</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 20-40 from second implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) is calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder. The sphere and cylinder values are from the manifest refraction assessment. Manifest refraction will be assessed at 4 meters under photopic lighting conditions using a phoropter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative dissipated energy (CDE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) represents the energy dissipated of the ultrasound tip and infusion sleeve at the incision point during the removal of cataractous lens. CDE will be reported on the Vision System interface and measured in percent-seconds. A lower CDE indicates that less energy was present at the incision site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated aspiration fluid used</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Aspiration fluid is the amount of fluid used during the removal of the cataractous lens. Aspiration fluid will be measured in milliliters (ml).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phaco aspiration time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>The average time the surgeon takes to complete the phacoemulsification will be assessed.</description>
