      This study evaluates the longterm clinical outcomes, including safety and efficacy parameters
      after Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) treatment over a period of 5 years. All patients included
      in de TASMA trial in the Netherlands will be asked to participate in the TASMA extension
      study.

        All subjects who underwent BT treatment in the TASMA study (protocol No.NL45394.018.13) and
        were not lost to follow-up at the end of the 30 week pre-marked visit, and those willing to
        comply with the study protocol and routine visits for the duration of the study will be
        included. The expected number of patients included in the TASMA study is n=40. These are
        patients with severe asthma despite maximal asthma therapy.
