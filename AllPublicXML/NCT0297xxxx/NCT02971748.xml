  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have inflammatory breast cancer
      (IBC) that did not respond completely to chemotherapy.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab in combination with
      standard hormone therapy can help to control and prevent IBC. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Its use in patients with IBC in combination with
      standard hormonal therapy is considered investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 (+/- 3 days) of each 21-day cycle.

      You will also receive hormonal therapy that your doctor has chosen for your standard
      treatment. The study doctor will tell you which hormonal therapy you receive, its risks, and
      how often you will receive it.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 months, as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

      °Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of every other cycle:

      °You will have a physical exam

      At Cycle 4 and then every 3 cycles after that (before Cycle 4, 7, 10, 13 and so on), blood
      (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and immune system testing. This blood will
      also be drawn if the disease appears to get worse.

      You will have chest wall or breast photos if the doctor thinks you need them. Also you will
      have imaging scans, including an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan, to check the status of
      the disease if the doctor thinks you need them as part of your standard care.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after you stop receiving the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 10 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, biomarker, and immune system
           testing.

        -  You will have the same imaging scans you had at screening to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1 month after the last dose of study drugs, you will be asked about your health and any
      side effects you may have had. You may be asked during a routine clinic visit or you may be
      called. If you are called, each call should last about 2 minutes.

      If you stopped taking the study drugs for reasons other than the disease getting worse, you
      will be called about 24 months after your first dose of pembrolizumab to learn how you are
      doing. If you are called, this should last about 3 minutes.
