    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer, and evidence of a homologous recombination gene deficiency, respond to
      treatment with rucaparib versus treatment with physician's choice of abiraterone acetate,
      enzalutamide, or docetaxel.
