      This study evaluates the effect of withdrawing amifampridine phosphate treatment from
      patients with LEMS. One half of the patients will continue to receive amifampridine phosphate
      and the other half will receive placebo, during this double-blind study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female â‰¥18 years of age and currently receiving amifampridine phosphate for
             LEMS.

          2. Diagnosis of LEMS by antibody testing or electromyography (EMG).

          3. Completion of anti-cancer treatment at least 3 months (90 days) prior to Screening.

          4. If receiving peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine), a
             stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitors is required for at least 7 days prior to
             randomization and throughout the study.

          5. If receiving permitted oral immunosuppressants (prednisone or other corticosteroid), a
             stable dose is required for at least 30 days prior to randomization and throughout the
             study.

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must practice an effective, reliable
             contraceptive regimen during the study.

          7. Able to perform all study procedures and assessments.

          8. Willing and able to travel to study site and attend all clinic study visits.

          9. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant long corrected QT (QTc) interval on ECG in previous 12 months.

          2. Seizure disorder.

          3. Active brain metastases.

          4. Unable to ambulate.

          5. Pregnant or lactating females.

          6. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study or confound the assessment of the patient.
