      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy
      guided transbronchial ablation for the treatment of early-stage inoperable peripheral lung
      cancer.

      The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy guided
      transbronchial ablation for treating inoperable patients with early-stage non-small cell lung
      cancer . The study is designed as a single-center prospective trial. The participating
      centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscope, Shanghai Chest Hospital
      affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Patients are divided into two groups,
      including radiofrequency ablation group and microwave ablation group.Eighty patients are
      expected to be enrolled into the study with 40 patients in each group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients discovered with peripheral lung nodules that have demonstrated to be
             non-small cell lung cancer by pathology with the clinical stage of IA.

          2. The tumors are solid or part-solid peripheral lung nodules and the length-diameter of
             the nodules are more than 8mm and no more than 30mm.

          3. Patients are unsuitable for surgery assessed by multi-modality treatment and agree to
             the primary treatment of ablation.

          4. Patients have good compliance and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients cannot receive bronchoscopy for the severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and
             other indications.

          2. Patients have contraindications of general anesthesia.

          3. Chest CT suggests that navigation bronchoscopy technology cannot guide treatment
             equipment to reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          4. Chest CT or bronchoscopy shows that the bronchial lumen occlusion or deformation
             leading to the guided and treatment equipment cannot reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          5. There are large blood vessels or important structures adjacent to peripheral lung
             lesion.

          6. Researchers consider the patient do not fit for the study.
