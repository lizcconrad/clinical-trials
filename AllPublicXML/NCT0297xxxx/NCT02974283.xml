    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out a serum marker for the evaluation of blood brain
      barrier damage based on animal experiments and investigate the effect of NBO（Normobaric
      hyperoxia）on blood brain barrier in the acute ischemic stroke patients who received r-tPA
      thrombolytic therapy.

    <description>Normobaric oxygen therapy is the delivery of high-flow oxygen (10L/min) via oxygen storage facemask. This therapy should start within 1 hours after diagnosis of ischemic stroke and last for 4hours. All participants will receive r-tPA thrombolytic therapy and a standard clinical therapy.</description>

    <description>In this study, it is simple to administer via oxygen storage facemask at flow rates of 10 L/min for 4 hours. This therapy start should within 1 hour after diagnosed ischemic stroke and uninterrupted during other treatments including r-tPA thrombolytic therapy and standard clinical treatment. .
