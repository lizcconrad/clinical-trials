  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose is to study quality in patient education by means of the patients'
      self-rated enablement. Specific aims are:

      To assess the validity of the patient enablement instrument in relation to self-efficacy and
      empowerment; To investigate if patient enablement can be effective in identifying which
      patients would benefit the most from patient education; To study if patient enablement has
      any relation to self-efficacy, function or self-rated health; To analyze if patient
      enablement has a causal effect on health care consumption; To evaluate whether patient
      education is a cost-effective intervention. The project is a longitudinal study, including
      patients from a patient education programme for osteoarthritis in primary health care. Data
      consist of patient reported outcome measures and health care consumption. Cost-effectiveness
      and cost-utility analysis will be used. Inclusion of patients will start August 2016.
      Analyses of data and manuscript writing will be performed in 2018-2019. Researchers included
      are from primary health care settings and researchers in the field of OA, patient education
      and health economy. Our increasingly older and more inactive population will raise huge
      demands on the health care. The importance of optimizing treatments that are available in
      primary health care cannot be underestimated. The project will contribute with important
      knowledge about the patient's own process of getting well.

      The project is a longitudinal study, including patients who are referred to patient education
      for osteoarthritis in primary health care and is planned to follow the patients one year
      before baseline measures as well as one year after baseline measures.

    <description>The intervention in the education program consists of three group lessons of about 90 minutes each where information about ethiology, risk factors, treatment and coping strategies concerning OA is included. The first two lessons are held by a physiotherapist and the third by a so-called expert patient that is a person with OA who shares his or her experiences of how to live with the disease. After the intervention patients are able to choose if they want to exercise at home or in a group, supervised by a physiotherapist.</description>
