    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that hypnosis is an alternative technique that could be
      applied to help patients with obesity to lose weight.

      The possibility that a self-conditioning technique (self-hypnosis) added to traditional
      approach (diet, exercise and behavioral recommendations) will be effective in determining
      weight loss with respect to the traditional approach in subjects with a body mass index (BMI)
      between 35 and 50 kg/m2 will be studied.

      Obesity is a serious health concern. Most lifestyle interventions fail over time; indeed,
      overeating often involves loss of control and compulsive behaviors.

      Hypnosis could increase the ability to control emotional impulses. Self-conditioning
      techniques borrowed from hypnosis (self-hypnosis) increase self-control and self-management
      of emotions. Recent hypnosis techniques with a rapid-induction phase allow the trained
      patients to go into self-hypnosis in a few minutes and to repeat the experience in complete
      autonomy, employing a short time of the day only.
