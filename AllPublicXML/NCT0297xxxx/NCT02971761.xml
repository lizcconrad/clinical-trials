    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and enobosarm work in
      treating patients with androgen receptor positive triple negative breast cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgen can cause the growth
      of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enobosarm may fight breast cancer by blocking
      the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and enobosarm may work better in
      treating patients with androgen receptor positive triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of the combination regimen.

      II. To determine the response rate (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] via
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of the combination of
      pembrolizumab with enobosarm (GTx-024) in patients with advanced androgen receptor (AR)
      positive (+) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical outcomes by RECIST 1.1 including clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24
      weeks, progression free-survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), event free survival
      (EFS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF); and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the role of immune-related response criteria (irRECIST).

      III. To evaluate the association of AR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association of an AR gene expression signature and clinical response.

      II. To evaluate genomic and phenotypic status of breast tumor.

      III. To evaluate the effect of the combination therapy on peripheral blood circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      IV. To evaluate the effect of combination therapy on tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) and TEX
      associated immune biomarkers.

      V. To evaluate pre-treatment programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) as a predictor of response to combination therapy.

      VI. To evaluate specific TIL subsets (e.g. CD4, CD8, regulatory T cell [Treg] distribution)
      and other immunological correlative (e.g. T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire analysis) as
      possible predictors of response.

      VII. To evaluate change in TILs as a result of the combination therapy.

      VIII. To evaluate peripheral blood, immune biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      enobosarm orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 3
      months, and bi-annually.
