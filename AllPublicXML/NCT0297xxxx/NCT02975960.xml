  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease, mainly characterized by cutaneous and
      visceral fibrosis. Digital ulcer and sclerosing skin are commonly affected on hands, but the
      treatment for these manifestations are often ineffective.

      Adipose tissue contains stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is abundant multipotent stem
      cells, capable of tissue repair. A prior study (NCT01813279) has shown the safety and
      tolerance at 6 months of the subcutaneous injection of SVF in the fingers in SSc.

      There are only few ways to manage SSc patients with skin lesion who already have treated with
      several medications (including vasodilators, PDE5 inhibitor, endothelin receptor antagonist)
      but some times their skin lesions are critical physically and emotionally.

      Autologous SVF injection could be one of the treatment options to treat skin lesion of SSc.
      Thus, the investigators study the efficacy and potential adverse event in Korean patients
      with SSc.

      In this study, the investigators will inject autologous Stromal vascular fraction.

      1) Acquiring autologous stromal vascular fraction by plastic surgeon

        1. Liposuction

        2. Extraction and purifying SVF using Smart-X system (15-20 min)

        3. Making syringe filled with autologous SVF

      2) SVF injection

      Inject SVF subcutaneously with 25G needle in finger
