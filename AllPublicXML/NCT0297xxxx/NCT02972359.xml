    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety of intravenous neridronic acid in patients
      with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

      The trial is divided into 3 periods: a 60-day enrollment period, a treatment period
      consisting of 4 infusions over 10 days, and a follow-up period of approximately 50 weeks
      (with visits at Week 2, Week 6, Week 12, Week 26, Week 39, and Week 52).

          -  A diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome according to the clinical diagnostic
             criteria recommended by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP;
             &quot;Budapest clinical criteria&quot;), assessed at Visit 1. Signs and symptoms of CRPS must
             apply to an affected limb (arm or leg) and must demonstrate asymmetry with respect to
             the contralateral limb.

          -  Ongoing moderate to severe chronic pain, including a baseline current pain intensity
             score of greater than or equal to 4 using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale referring
             to the CRPS-affected limb, at Visit 2 (prior to dosing).

          -  In stable treatment and follow-up therapy for CRPS for at least 1 month prior to
             allocation to treatment (Visit 2). Participants must have failed trials of at least 2
             treatments for CRPS, one of which must be a pharmacologic treatment.

             acceptable contraception, including at least 1 highly effective method of
             contraception with a low failure rate, defined as less than 1% per year (e.g., oral
             contraceptives or intrauterine device), and a second medically acceptable method such
             as use of condoms with spermicide by their male partner. A barrier method alone is not
             acceptable. Highly effective methods of contraception must be used for at least 1
             month prior to Visit 2 and for the duration of the trial.

          -  Participants must be able to communicate meaningfully, be able to differentiate with
             regard to location and intensity of the pain, and be able to answer the questions in
             the questionnaires used in this trial (assistance in filling out the questionnaires
             may be provided, if required due to motor or other impairment).

             the central laboratory's reference range at Visit 1; clinically unstable cardiac
             disease, including: unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable
             congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or an indwelling pacemaker;
             evidence of complete left bundle branch block; complete atrioventricular block;
             history of Long QT Syndrome or a relative with this condition; or any other known risk

             inhibitor antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, escitalopram) or tricyclic
             antidepressants are eligible if the QT-interval values do not meet the exclusion
             criteria, the medication was started at least 1 month prior to allocation, the dose is
             stable, and the dose is anticipated to remain stable until at least 4 days after the
             last infusion of IMP.

          -  Anticipated requirement for treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonate for
             another condition such as osteoporosis during the trial, or administration of
             denosumab (Prolia®) or other drugs affecting bone turnover or bone metabolism within 6

             disease (e.g., impacted molars, severe tooth decay, foci of infection) that may
             predispose to need for tooth extraction or other invasive dental procedures during the
             trial. Participants with indeterminate, suspicious or unreliable dental history, in
             the opinion of the investigator, must undergo a dental examination prior to receiving
             treatment.

          -  Evidence of denture-related gum trauma or improperly fitting dentures causing injury.

          -  Prior radiation therapy of the head or neck (within 1 year of Visit 1).

          -  Any other severe medical condition, including severe depression, or any other severe
             mood disorder, that in the opinion of the investigator may affect efficacy or safety
             assessments or may compromise the participant's safety during trial participation.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Elevated aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 2-fold
             upper limit of normal, based on central safety laboratory data obtained at Visit 1, or
             current evidence of chronic liver disease. Safety laboratory testing may be repeated
             prior to Visit 2, and participants will be allowed in the trial if results of 2
             consecutive tests, at least 3 days apart, are less than or equal to 2-fold upper limit
             of normal.

          -  Participation in another investigational drug trial within 3 months prior to Visit 1
             or any previous trial with neridronic acid, with the exception of participants of
