          -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109 /L Platelet count ≥75 × 109/L
             Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT and AST ≤2.5×ULN; for
             patients with hepatic metastases, ALT and AST ≤5×ULN Calculated creatinine clearance
             &gt;40 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault (using actual body weight), or by measured
             24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance.

          -  Evidence of post-menopausal status, or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase
