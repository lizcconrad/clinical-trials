  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called
      ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib works by blocking a protein called JAK. JAK works along with another
      protein called STAT and is important for survival of many T or NK-cell lymphomas. By blocking
      JAK, ruxolitinib may cause T or NK-cell lymphomas to shrink.

          -  Previous systemic anti-cancer therapy for T-cell lymphoma must have been discontinued
             at least 2 weeks prior to treatment.

               -  Glucocorticoids aimed at controlling lymphoma-related symptoms are allowed as
                  long as they are tapered down to 20mg or less by the time of ruxolitiib
                  initiation

               -  Topical steroids for CTCL are permitted

               -  See section 6.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria for guideline regarding adjuvant and
                  maintenance therapy for prior malignancy
