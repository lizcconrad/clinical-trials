    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec works and nivolumab in treating
      patients with lymphomas that do not responded to treatment or non-melanoma skin cancers that
      have spread to other places in the body or do not responded to treatment. Biological
      therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that
      may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from
      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block a protein needed by tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving talimogene laherparepvec and nivolumab may work better in treating
      patients with lymphomas or non-melanoma skin cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of patients responding (response rate) to talimogene
      laherparepvec monotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the local response rate to talimogene laherparepvec in injected tumors.

      II. To determine the response rate to talimogene laherparepvec + nivolumab (NIVO).

      III. To identify potential pre-treatment and on-treatment correlative biomarkers of local and
      systemic immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Patients without
      response at week 12, may also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 for course 1 then every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years.

    <description>Arm assignment is based on tumor type: Merkel cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, other non-melanoma skin cancers, and refractory T cell lymphomas and NK cell lymphomas. If at least 4 responses were observed in an arm (observed response rate [RR] = 4/17 or 23.5%), talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) would be considered promising in that tumor type.
