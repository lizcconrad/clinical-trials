    <textblock>
      The proposed study will randomize adults (18 years of age or older) with pulmonary MDR-TB
      with sputum that contains M. tuberculosis that is isoniazid and rifampin resistant by
      MTBDRplus and fluoroquinolone susceptible by MTBDRsl HIV seropositive (with or without
      antiretroviral therapy) or negative (but not unknown) and Karnofsky score of &gt;60 at sites in
      Moldova, Peru, and the Philippines.

      Patients with MDR-TB will be randomized to oral regimen of delamanid (DLM), linezolid (LZD),
      levofloxacin (LFX) and pyrazinamide (PZA) for 24, 32, 40, 48 or 56 weeks or World Health
      Organization (WHO) standard of care MDR-TB regimen (9-month &quot;modified Bangladesh&quot; regimen or
      WHO standard MDR-TB regimen).

      Primary Objective

      1. Determine the shortest duration of the delamanid-containing oral regimen that is
      non-inferior to the blended WHO standard regimen.

      Secondary Objective

        1. Define the safety and tolerability of the oral delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin and
           pyrazinamide regimen.

        2. Determine if baseline PZA susceptibility is associated with shorter time to non-inferior
           treatment duration.

        3. Identify the relationship between delamanid and linezolid serum drug levels and time to
           sputum culture conversion among patients on the delamanid-containing oral regimen.

        4. Identify the relationship between delamanid and linezolid serum drug levels and
           occurrence of adverse events among patients on the delamanid-containing oral regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis that is resistant to at least
      isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important anti-TB drugs. WHO has estimated that over
      480,000 new cases of MDR-TB occurred in 127 countries in 2014, causing 150,000 deaths; this
      represents a 70% increase in the number of cases since 2000. MDR-TB cure rates are
      substantially lower than the 85+% cure expected in drug-susceptible TB. The MDR-TB treatment
      regimen currently recommended by WHO includes at least 4 second-line drugs plus PZA for 18-24
      months, including an injectable agent for the induction phase of 6-8 month. However, the
      average global success rate of such treatment among patients treated in TB programs is only
      50%. More recently, an alternative treatment regimen, known as the &quot;Bangladesh&quot; regimen, has
      become available.This regimen uses 7 drugs given for 9 months but still includes an
      injectable agent, which is the cause of the most common and severe toxicities seen when
      treating MDR-TB. In selected patients this regimen has been able to achieve over 80% cures,
      but use has been restricted to geographic areas where previous use of second-line drugs is
      rare. Alternatives will be necessary for other settings and patients with prior second-line
      drug exposure.

      Treatment-limiting side effects are common when using second-line drugs for long periods of
      time. Overall, 69-73% of patients with MDR-TB treated with the WHO standard regimen are
      reported to have experienced at least one side effect, and 29%-55% discontinued one or more
      study drugs because of inability to tolerate a drug. The Bangladesh regimen also has
      substantial toxicity, with 63% of participants experiencing adverse drug reactions in one
      report. Thus, while this regimen is shorter and slightly better tolerated than the WHO
      standard regimen, it still does not provide an easily tolerated alternative, largely because
      it contains an injectable agent.

      The 20-24 month regimen currently in use exposes patients to drug toxicity over prolonged
      periods of time and demands substantial human resources. Patients receiving these regimens
      require two years of directly observed therapy with careful monitoring for drug toxicity.
      Reduction in the duration of treatment would free up program staff to treat additional MDR-TB
      patients. Development of a shorter treatment regimen will greatly enhance the ability of
      programs to keep up with the anticipated increase in patients needing treatment.

      This application proposes a study to determine whether the 9-month oral regime that uses
      Delaminid, Linezolid, Levofloxacin and Pyrazinamide is as good as the current WHO standard of
      care regimen.

      The study proposes to randomize approximately 300 adults in Peru, Moldova and Phillipines
      where MDR-TB is common.
