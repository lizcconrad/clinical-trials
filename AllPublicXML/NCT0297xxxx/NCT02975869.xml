    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the impact a collaborative palliative care and oncology
      team will have on the quality of life, symptoms, mood, and end of life outcomes of patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Palliative care is a medical specialty focused on
      lessening (or &quot;palliating&quot;) symptoms and assisting in coping with serious illness.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare two types of care - standard leukemia oncology
      care and standard leukemia oncology care with collaborative involvement of palliative care
      clinicians to see which is better for improving the experience of patients and families with
      AML undergoing treatment.

      The investigators aim to find out whether introducing patients and families undergoing AML
      treatment to the palliative care team that specializes in symptom management can improve the
      physical and psychological symptoms that patients and families experience during their
      hospitalizations for their leukemia care as well as enhance the quality of patients' end of
      life care.
