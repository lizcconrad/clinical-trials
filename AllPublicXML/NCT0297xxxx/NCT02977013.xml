  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to monitor anticoagulant therapy by anti-Xa assay and
      correlate its level to the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in the treatment of pulmonary
      embolism.

      This prospective randomized trial was conducted on 42 patients 18 years of age or older in
      ICU diagnosed to have pulmonary embolism and confirmed by the presence of intraluminal
      filling defect in CT pulmonary angiography and treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin 1
      mg/kg/12 hours. The study was conducted from August 2013 to September 2016.

      All the patients were examined daily over a period of 4 weeks for symptoms and signs of
      recurrent pulmonary embolism (recurrent pulmonary embolism was diagnosed if the repeat CT
      angiography revealed a new sudden arterial branch cutoff or a new intraluminal filling defect
      that was not present on the first angiogram), Platelet count (patients with platelet count
      less than 50,000/mm3 or those with bleeding and platelet count between 50,000 and 100,000/mm3
      are considered having severe thrombocytopenia), bleeding (defined as major overt bleeding
      requiring blood transfusion &gt; 2 units or marked hemoglobin drop &gt; 2 gm/dl or if the bleeding
      was intracranial or retroperitoneal) and death (defined as all deaths occurring within the 4
      weeks of the study) , Then the results were correlated to anti-Xa assay.

        The study was conducted on 42 patients in ICU diagnosed to have pulmonary embolism by CT
        pulmonary angiography and treated by subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours.
        Anticoagulant therapy was followed by anti-Xa assay done 4 hours after the third dose of
        subcutaneous enoxaparin and the results were correlated to the clinical outcome of the
        patients as regards complications (recurrent pulmonary embolism, bleeding, low platelet
        count and death).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in ICU and diagnosed to have pulmonary embolism and confirmed by the presence
             of intraluminal filling defect in CT pulmonary angiography and treated with
             subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/12 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who underwent thrombolysis, embolectomy or if they are unfit for
             anticoagulant therapy because of major bleeding or thrombocytopenia (a platelet count
             below 100,000 per cubic millimeter). Patients were also excluded if they had impaired
             kidney function with a serum creatinine level above 2 mg/dl or uncontrolled
             hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg).
