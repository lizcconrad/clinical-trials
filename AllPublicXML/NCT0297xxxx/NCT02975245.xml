      This study will determine the short-term effects of chemotherapy on sperm DNA.The study
      involves the collection of semen sample through ejaculation prior to initiation of
      chemotherapy and up to three time points after initiation of chemotherapy.

      While medical advances in the area of cancer treatment have successfully improved the overall
      detection and treatment of many cancers affecting men and women alike, these very treatment
      modalities can adversely affect their reproductive capacity.

      Certain types of chemotherapy, such as alkylating agents, are notorious for placing patients
      at high risk for infertility. For men, the best recommendation for patients undergoing such
      therapy is to cryopreserve semen prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this may
      not always occur. Some patients have been noted to present to discuss fertility preservation
      options after completing their first cycle of chemotherapy. In this situation, they will most
      likely still have sperm which was produced prior to chemotherapy that can be collected even
      if the stem cells producing the sperm have been damaged or destroyed. However, there are no
      national guidelines addressing this particular situation. Typically, physicians may advise
      men to avoid conception anywhere from three months to two years after the final dose of
      chemotherapy to ensure all exposed germ cells have passed through and only newly formed germ
      cells remain.

      It is crucial to further assess the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on male germ cells in
      the short window of time between exposure and potential sterility. If a safe time frame could
      be determined to collect sperm after a single dose of chemotherapy, then these men could be
      given a second chance to retain their fertility potential.
