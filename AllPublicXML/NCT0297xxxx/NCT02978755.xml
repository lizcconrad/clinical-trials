  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First in human study, assessing the safety profile, the pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      antitumor activity of GM102, a new compound (a monoclonal antibody), in patients with
      previously treated gynecological cancers bearing the AMHRII (anti-mullerian Hormone Receptor
      II) receptor. The primary objective of the study is to determine the GM102 recommended dose.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMHRII is reexpressed in a subset of gynecological cancers. GM102 is a humanized low fucose
      monoclonal antibody with a high affinity to AMHRII receptor. GM102 acts through enhanced
      capability to engage immune effector cells (macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells) to
      trigger ADCC (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and phagocytosis of tumor cells.

      Patients with gynecological tumors expressing AMHRII receptor on the tumor cells in archived
      tissue as determined prior to study entry will be eligible for C101 study.

      C101 consists of a phase I part (dose and schedule escalation) and a phase Ib part
      (expansion).

      The phase I part is designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) using the
      classical 3+3 dose-finding design. In six successive escalating dose cohorts, patients will
      receive GM102 infusions every 2 weeks until progression or toxicity. In 4 additional cohorts,
      patients will receive GM102 infusions weekly until progression or toxicity and GM102
      infusions combined with chemotherapy until progression or toxicity.

      A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will analyze and qualify the toxicities and will provide
      recommendations according to the dose administration rules defined in the protocol.

      At the end of the phase I part, the RP2D will be determined, taking into account dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs), overall toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics effects
      of GM102.

      The Phase Ib part of the study will confirm the tolerance of the selected dose (RP2D) and
      will assess antitumoral activity of GM102 in three parallel cohorts of patients with Sex
      Cord-Stromal tumors, and AMHRII positive ovarian and cervix cancers. Patients will be treated
      until progression or toxicity.
