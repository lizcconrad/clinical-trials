  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) add-on to
      antidepressant medication in treating patients who do not relieve during standard
      antidepressant treatment for 6 weeks at least. Meanwhile, secondary outcomes will include
      changes in some biomarkers and on specifically local brain activity (functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging, fMRI) and white matter integrity (Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI). The
      hypothesis of this study is that NAC has positive effects on refractory major depressive
      disorder patients with increased inflammatory activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's a double-blind randomised placebo controlled antidepressant augmentation study with
      12-week treatment and 8-week follow up. Its purpose is to investigate antidepressant efficacy
      and safety of NAC in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) defined as
      insufficient response to 1 or more antidepressants given for at least 6 weeks and in an
      adequate dose, displaying increased peripheral inflammatory activity and moderate to severe
      depression. Apart from studying the effects of NAC on depression severity, the secondary
      outcomes are to examine a range of biomarkers related to potentially important underlying
      mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory activity and to evaluate the effects on
      brain functioning (fMRI) and on white matter integrity (DTI). Scale assessments are performed
      in the week preceding initiation of treatment, during the treatment period, at the end of the
      treatment period and at 8-week follow up. Neuro-imaging is performed before the treatment
      starts and in week 12, before the study medication is terminated. Collection of blood and
      morning urine only takes place at three time points, in the week preceding initiation of
      treatment, closely before tapering off the study medication and at the end of 8-week follow
      up. This study is hoped to show that NAC perform positive effects on those aspects mentioned
      above.

             mild to moderate chronic inflammation, while values &gt; 10 mg/L point at acute
             inflammation. A pilot study at the Tianjin Hospital (n=62) indicated that
             approximately one third of all patients with MDD will have CRP values within this
             range). insufficient response to 1 or more antidepressants given for at least 6 weeks

             sign the informed consent on behalf of the participants when the capacity of
