  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional indirect indicators of iron status, using serum and red blood cell biomarkers,
      are confounded by inflammation from common infections and are therefore of limited use in
      populations carrying a high burden of infection and inflammation, as for example women of
      reproductive age in malaria endemic areas in developing countries. Even without the
      confounding effect of inflammation, current markers of iron status are insensitive to small
      changes in dietary iron and do not allow to establish associations between dietary, lifestyle
      and genetic factors and iron balance. With a new method based on the dilution of a previously
      administered and equilibrated stable isotope signal, an accurate measurement of long-term
      oral iron balance and absorption is possible, allowing the estimation of iron requirements
      and potentially providing fundamental guidance for supplementation and fortification programs
      in both healthy and chronically inflamed/infected patients. In the current study the novel
      methodology will be validated in generally healthy subjects with low iron status. The
      technique will be used to assess dietary and lifestyle determinants of iron status and to
      compare the effect on iron balance and iron status of three distinct, commonly used iron
      interventions: food fortification with iron; oral iron supplementation, and intravenous iron
      infusion.
