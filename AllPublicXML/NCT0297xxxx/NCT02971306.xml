  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis is related to very high mortality rate. About 40% of the patients are
      died within first 6 months after the detection of the clinical syndrome. Therefore, it is
      very essential for proper diagnosis and early treatment. In response to acute or chronic
      liver damage, bone marrow derived stem cells can spontaneously populate liver and
      differentiate into hepatic cells. Animal and human studies suggested that injured hepatocyte
      may be replaced by pluripotent bone marrow cells. However, this hepatocyte repopulation is
      highly dependent on varieties of liver injury and therapeutic conditions6. The studies has
      suggested Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) can regenerate hepatocyte by fusing
      with hematopoietic cells, thereby enhancing the liver histology and survival rate.

      G-CSF is a cytokine capable to regulate a number of functions in neutrophils. In three recent
      studies mobilization of bone marrow stem cells induced by G-CSF was observed in patients with
      alcoholic hepatitis. In two of this studies there was a survival benefit with the use of
      G-CSF.

      Alcoholism leads to decrease in endogenous antioxidant potential. Alcoholic liver disease
      (ALD) patients show low endogenous antioxidants. Chronic ethanol consumption cause selective
      deficiency in the availability of reduced glutathione (GSH) in mitochondria has been
      reported. This is due to impaired functioning of GSH transporter from cytosol to
      mitochondrial matrix. The effect on glutathione replenishing potential by N-acetyl cysteine
      (NAC) can be used to reduce oxidative stress, which also has excellent safety profile.
      Therefore, NAC can be used for severe alcoholic hepatitis treatment due to its therapeutic
      potential factor. NAC also inhibit apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In a
      study high doses of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine therapy for 14 days conferred neither
      survival benefits nor early biological improvement in severe alcoholic hepatitis patients
      with adequate nutritional support.However, these results must be viewed with caution, since
      the study suffered from a lack of power. In a recent study, NAC and corticosteroids
      combination therapy benefits among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis in 1 month
      survival, although the final outcome at 6 month survival was not improved. There are no
      studies on the use of combination therapy of NAC plus G-CSF in patient with severe alcoholic
      hepatitis.

      Therefore we plan to study the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of G-CSF and NAC in
      the patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

      Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, admitted to Department of Hepatology PGIMER,
      Chandigarh from July 2014 to December 2016 will be included in the study.

      METHODS

      This will be an open label trial. A randomization code is generated by random number table.
      The patients will be randomized to receive standard medical therapy of pentoxifylline only as
      control and combination therapy of Pentoxifylline with NAC and G-CSF as cases. There will be
      one control and two cases as below:

      1) Pentoxifylline (control) 2) Pentoxifylline+G-CSF (case 1) 3) Pentoxifylline+G-CSF +NAC
      (case2) A) Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily for 28 days A) Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice
      daily for 28 days plus G-CSF 5 mcg/kg every 12 hourly for consecutive 5 days A)
      Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily for 28 days plus G-CSF 5 mcg/kg every 12 hourly for 5 days
      plus NAC 300 mg/kg on day 1 (150 mg/kg in 250 ml of 5% dextrose over a minute of 30
      minutes,50 mg/kg in 500ml 5% dextrose over a period of 4 hours, 100mg /kg in 1000 ml of 5%
      dextrose over a period of 16 hours ) and on day 2 through 5 100mg /kg/day in 1000ml of
      glucose solution.

      This will be a single time therapy. Patients will be admitted in the department of hepatology
      and will be assessed everyday clinically as well as by laboratory tests during therapy to
      assess safety and effects of treatment.

        1. Total leukocytes count will be assessed daily.

        2. Circulating CD 34 positive cells will be measured on day 0 and 6 of G-CSF therapy.

        3. In addition, ultrasonography will be performed at day 1 and 6 in order to evaluate
           difference in spleen size and portal vein flow.

        4. Biochemical, coagulation, and hematological parameters (Liver function tests, Renal
           Function Tests, Prothrombin Time, International Normalised Ratio, etc.) will be
           monitored periodically, daily for 1 week, then weekly for 1month and monthly for three
           month.

      All patients will be followed at weekly interval for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months.

      Outcome:

      Primary Objectives:

      Survival at 3 months

      Secondary Objectives:

      Mobilisation of CD34 positive cells in peripheral blood. Clinical/biochemical improvement in
      liver function profile. Improvement in prognostic scores-Maddrey's Discriminant function,
      MELD score, and Child score.
