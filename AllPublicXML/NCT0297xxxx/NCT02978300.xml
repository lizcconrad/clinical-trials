  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is the leading cause of ICU admission of immunocompromized
      patients. In this subgroup of patients, the need for intubation and invasive mechanical
      ventilation occurs in about 50% of cases and is associated with very a high mortality rate,
      reaching 70% of cases. Therefore, noninvasive oxygenation strategies have been developed to
      avoid intubation.

      More than 15 years ago, 2 trials have suggested that NIV could decrease intubation and
      mortality rates of immunocompromized patients as compared to standard oxygen through a mask.
      However these results have not been confirmed in a recent large trial.

      HFNC is a recent and well-tolerated oxygenation technique. In a recent trial, HFNC alone
      could decrease mortality and intubation rates in patients with ARF as compared to NIV.
      Similar findings have been reported in a post-hoc analysis on immunocompromized patients
      excluding those with profound neutropenia. Likewise in a retrospective monocentric cohort of
      immunocompromized patients, we reported better outcomes with HFNC than with NIV.
