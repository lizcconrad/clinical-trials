    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis, also called chronic sinusitis, is a very common life-long disease
      affecting over 5% of the Canadian population. Its symptoms, including daily facial pain and
      headache, an inability to breath through the nose and complete smell loss, regularly impair
      one's ability to work and to enjoy and participate in daily activities. The annual cost of
      chronic sinusitis to Canada is estimated at $1.3 billion while the government pays an
      estimated $860 million yearly for chronic sinusitis treatment. Chronic sinusitis with polyps,
      the most common type of chronic sinusitis, is usually treated with a combination of
      medications and surgery. Until now, surgical treatment has only been performed in the
      operating room, at a cost of about $3500 per procedure. But, recent studies have shown that a
      new procedure, &quot;in-clinic polyp removal&quot;, can provide an improvement in patient symptoms to
      levels equal to those for sinus surgery performed in a hospital operating room. Moreover, in
      clinic polyp removal has additional advantages including a shorter procedure recovery time, a
      significantly lower cost to the health care system (about one-tenth the cost or $450), and a
      shorter wait time for treatment. With the proposed pragmatic trial, the investigators will
      determine whether the in clinic polyp removal procedure is as good as sinus surgery in the
      operating room at controlling patient symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The investigators will
      also determine the cost and health-benefits for a patient, the healthcare system and for
      society of in clinic polyp removal in comparison to sinus surgery done in a hospital
      operating room. The investigators will then know if this new treatment, in clinic polyp
      removal, can replace sinus surgery as the standard of care for these patients.

      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is common, with a Canadian prevalence of 5%, and associated with
      significant morbidity having a health state utility value equivalent to end-stage renal
      disease. Understandably, CRS impairs workplace productivity but that productivity
      substantially increases following surgical treatment.

      However, the wait time to receive surgical treatment (ESS) maybe up to 8 months or longer,
      with a cost to the Government of $3500/ESS procedure. The annual direct cost of CRS is
      estimated at $860 million with an overall financial impact of 1.3 billion dollars per year
      for Canada. Endoscopic polypectomy in clinic (EPIC), a potential disruptive innovation, is a
      drastically deescalated form of ESS performed in clinic instead of the operating room. EPIC
      appears to provide quality of life (QofL) improvement equivalent to that reported for ESS.
      EPIC has a shorter wait time and lower cost to a government, i.e. nearly one-tenth of ESS or
      about $450. A pilot economic evaluation study demonstrated that EPIC was cost-effective
      compared to ESS. This has created a controversy about which treatment should be employed for
      these patients. Further, a recent Cochrane review identified the need for high-quality
      randomised controlled trials to determine if ESS has additional benefit over polypectomy as
      there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the superiority of
      polypectomy or ESS for the management of CRS with polyps.

      The proposed national multicenter randomised controlled trial will determine whether EPIC is
      non-inferior to the current treatment standard, ESS, in QofL improvement for patients with
      CRS with polyps. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of performing EPIC in place of
      ESS. The investigators hypothesize that EPIC will be non-inferior to ESS for QofL improvement
      while reducing health care cost. This would imply that EPIC is a dominant strategy and that
      the ESS strategy represents over-treatment in this patient population. The study findings
      would position EPIC into the current CRS treatment paradigm thereby transforming care and
      reducing costs both nationally and internationally.
