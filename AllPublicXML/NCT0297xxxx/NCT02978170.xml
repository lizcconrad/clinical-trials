  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if adding a Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) scan
      during a scheduled bronchoscopy can help researchers biopsy lung lesions that are harder to
      reach.

      CBCT is a newer type of CT scan that researchers will use to make sure the tools used to
      biopsy these lesions (called a bronchoscope and a radial probe-EBUS [RP-EBUS]) are in the
      right location. The safety and feasibility of adding this extra scan to a standard
      bronchoscopy will also be studied.

      Bronchoscopy:

      If participant is eligible and agrees to take part in this study, as a part of participant's
      standard care, participant will have a bronchoscopy to biopsy participant's suspicious lung
      lesion. Participant will receive a separate consent form describing the standard bronchoscopy
      and its risks.

      During the standard bronchoscopy, the staff will use a CBCT scan to confirm that the tips of
      the instruments are properly placed and can reach and sample the suspicious areas being
      targeted. If the instruments are not in the right position, the staff will use the CBCT
      images to re-position their tools, if possible.

      After the samples are collected, they will be sent to the pathology laboratory at MD Anderson
      for testing:

        -  If the tests show that the lesions are not cancerous, participant will be followed by
           the study staff for 6 months to watch for changes to the lesion (which is normally part
           of standard care). This will include collecting information from participant's medical
           record.

        -  If the tests show that the lesions are cancerous, patient's participation on this
           research study will be over, and participant will receive standard care for this type of
           disease (which may include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy).

      Length of Study Participation:

      Patient's active participation in this study will be over after participant's tissue samples
      are collected, unless follow-up imaging scans need to be collected to check the status of the
      disease.

      This is an investigational study. Bronchoscopy and CBCT are both FDA approved and
      commercially available. Both are considered standard procedures. However, the combination of
      using CBCT to guide bronchoscopy tools into the lung lesions is considered investigational.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
