  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of IgY as assessed by changes in
      the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein and investigate the effect of IgY on the gut
      microbiome as assessed by 16s RNA sequencing of fecal samples.
