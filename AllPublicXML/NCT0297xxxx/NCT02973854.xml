  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen at the Center for Endometriosis (including those with or without pain)
      undergoing laser excision surgery for known or suspected endometriosis will be recruited for
      the study.

      Per the PI's standard surgical approach to endometriosis, all areas of abnormal peritoneum
      will be excised (removed).

      After surgical excision has been performed, in order to provide standardized specimens for
      our research, a 3mm punch biopsy will be obtained from the excised peritoneum tissue. The 3
      mm biopsy will be sent for research analysis, and the rest of the excised peritoneum tissue
      will be sent to histology (SSM) for evaluation and classification as having endometriosis or
      not. For each patient in the study, blood will also be collected to look for markers for
      endometriosis.

      The study is investigator-initiated, prospective, comparative study. Laparoscopic surgery for
      endometriosis on patients presenting with pain, infertility or both will be performed by the
      principal investigator at St. Mary's Hospital. We will be collecting preoperative, operative
      and postoperative follow-up data on all patients recruited for this study based on our
      well-established database protocol (IRB#20900), which includes data collection on pain scores
      (by VAS scales) and standardized QOL scales, this information will be collected from the
      patient's SOC preop questionnaire section A-H and the 6-month follow questionnaire. The
      surgical approach in the treatment of endometriosis is by excision only, so that all lesions
      (abnormal areas of peritoneum) are excised resulting in tissue specimens that are classified
      at a histologic level, which is the gold standard way to diagnose the presence of
      endometriosis
