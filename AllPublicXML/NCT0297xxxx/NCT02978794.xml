      With the extension of the average life expectancy, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases
      is also rising. Stroke in Taiwan has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but
      also in countries around the world), stroke and the impact of socio-economic and health
      spending are large how to reduce the degree of disability after stroke is an important issue
      in medicine. For a long time, the resident will fill the clinical pathway form before the
      stroke inpatients were discharged. We also analyzed the data of clinical pathway every three
      months.

      According to the current data of stroke clinical pathway included demographic data, length of
      hospitalization days, complications, functional independent measure, Brunnstrom motor
      recovery stage, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale, blood pressure
      data, and post-stroke checklist for a retrospective analysis to provide more complete and
      more comprehensive information on follow-up care for stroke patients and effective use of
      medical resources, to improve the quality of future medical care and quality of life for
      stroke patients.
