  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project examines 1) the effects of appropriately timed bright light on adaptation (in
      terms of sleep and sleepiness) to three consecutive night shifts; and 2) the effects of such
      bright light on re-adaptation (in terms of sleep and sleepiness) to a day-oriented schedule
      after the night shift period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shift workers frequently experience sleepiness during night shifts, which may have
      consequences for performance. Sleep duration is often shortened after a night shift. Properly
      timed bright light treatment is efficient in delaying the circadian rhythm and can enhance
      alertness, increase performance and prolong sleep after night shifts. There is a lack of
      studies on light treatment to rotating shift workers. This study is a randomized controlled
      crossover trial evaluating the effect of bright light treatment on sleep and sleepiness in
      rotating shift workers with three consecutive night shifts. The aim is to evaluate whether
      bright light treatment improves adaptation to three consecutive night shifts (reduces
      sleepiness during night shifts and improves sleep after night shifts), as well as whether
      such treatment affects re-adaptation to a day-oriented schedule after the night shift period.
