  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, two arm parallel design study. This study
      is comprised of two phases: screening and treatment. The screening period will be up to 5
      days, followed by the treatment phase of 28±4 days. During the treatment phase subjects will
      be randomized to receive either test or reference treatments in a double-blind manner in an
      outpatient setting. Randomization of subjects will be in a 1:1 ratio for the test and
      reference drug arms and will be stratified by site.

      Screening will begin at visit 1, during which eligibility will be determined and prohibited
      treatments will be discontinued. Randomization will occur following the confirmation of the
      eligibility criteria at visit 2 (baseline, Day 1) i.e. initiation of treatment phase. The
      treatment phase will be 28±4 days in duration wherein subject will receive treatment with
      investigational product (either test or reference) on Day 1 or Baseline (visit 2). Safety and
      tolerability assessments will be performed on Day 7 (visit 3). Efficacy, safety and
      tolerability will be assessed on Day 14 (visit 4) followed by the End of study visit on Day
      28 (visit 5). If positive identification of scabies is confirmed at Day 14 (visit 4), the
      subject will be retreated with the second application of the investigational product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic absorption of permethrin cream is limited to 0.5% during the first 48 hours
      following dermal application. In these settings, a conventional pharmacokinetic human study
      to demonstrate that Mayne Permethrin cream (5% w/w) is bioequivalent to the Reference Listed
      Drug [RLD] Elimite™ is not appropriate.

      This is a clinical endpoint bioequivalence (BE) study for a Permethrin Cream, 5% formulation
      for the treatment of active scabies in comparison to Elimite™ Permethrin cream (5% w/w).

        -  Test Product: Permethrin Cream, 5%

        -  Reference Product: Elimite™ marketed by Prestium Pharma, Inc. (&quot;Prestium&quot;), the branded
           subsidiary of Renaissance Pharma.

      The infested person, as well as household members are treated at the same time to prevent
      re-infestation. In consideration of this recommendation, the household members of the
      enrolled subject will be examined and treated at the same time as the enrolled subject with
      an FDA-approved generic Permethrin Cream, 5%.

             prior to randomization, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (for purpose of
             this study a female of childbearing potential is considered to be not surgically
             sterile or postmenopausal for at least 1 year) who are not using or do not agree to
             use an acceptable form of contraception (oral /implant /injectable /transdermal
