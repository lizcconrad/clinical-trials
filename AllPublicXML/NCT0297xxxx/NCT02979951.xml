      The purpose of this European, multicentric, prospective, non-interventional study is to
      document and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of severely infected patients
      with intravenously administered fosfomycin, including patients with osteomyelitis,
      complicated urinary tract infection, nosocomial lower respiratory tract infection, bacterial
      meningitis/central nervous system infection, bacteraemia/sepsis, skin and soft tissue
      infection, endocarditis or other infections, each as far as covered by the respective
      nationally relevant SmPC.

    <description>Definition of clinical cure (both criteria must be fulfilled):
Resolution of signs and symptoms and
microbiological cure or no additional antibiotic therapy for the targeted infection necessary.
Definition of clinical improvement (both criteria must be fulfilled):
Partial resolution of signs and symptoms and
microbiological cure or no additional antibiotic therapy for the targeted infection necessary.
Definition of microbiological cure:
Elimination of the relevant pathogen(s) at the relevant site(s) of infection (at least one negative culture) or
in case &quot;no sample available/indicated due to sufficient clinical response&quot;, pathogen elimination is considered.
Time Frame:
Time point &quot;End of fosfomycin treatment&quot; (EOT) is reached at the day of the last fosfomycin application in the course of the treatment schedule for the targeted infection (i.e., in case of a multiple stage treatment schedule, the end of the last fosfomycin treatment phase).</description>
