    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II study for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a platinum based regimen or
      with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      combination of cetuximab and afatinib.

    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are
      previously treated with a platinum based regimen or with an immune checkpoint inhibitor will
      be eligible for participation on the study. After a baseline evaluation and biopsy, they will
      be treated with weekly IV cetuximab and daily oral afatinib. Biopsy will be repeated where
      feasible after 4 weeks on therapy and again at disease progression or end of treatment.
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or development of grade 3 or higher drug
      related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 1 despite appropriate supportive care.

          -  Prior cetuximab permitted if it was given for no more than 9 doses in combination with
