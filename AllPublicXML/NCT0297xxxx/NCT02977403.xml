    <textblock>
      Background:

      People are constantly exposed to unhealthy foods. Some studies of adults show that training
      attention away from unhealthy foods might reduce overeating. Researchers want to see what
      happens in the brain when teens train their attention away from food through a program on a
      smartphone.

      Objective:

      To study the relationship between eating patterns, body weight, and how the brain reacts to
      different images.

      Eligibility:

      Right-handed females ages 12-17 who are overweight (Body Mass Index at or above the 85th
      percentile for age).

      Design:

      Participants will have 6 visits over about 8 months.

      Visit 1: participants will be screened with:

      Height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size measurements

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Urine sample

      DXA scan. Participants will lie on a table while a very small dose of x-rays passes through
      the body.

      Questions about their general health, social and psychological functioning, and eating habits

      Parents or guardians of minor participants will answer questions about their child s
      functioning and demographic data.

      Before visits 2-6, participants will not eat or drink for about 12 hours. These visits will
      include some or all of these procedures:

      Blood drawn

      MRI scan. Participants will lie on a stretcher that slides in and out of a metal cylinder in
      a strong magnetic field. A device will be placed over the head.

      Meals provided. Participants will fill out rating forms.

      Simple thinking tasks

      A cone containing magnetic field detectors placed onto the head

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Urine sample

      Participants will be assigned to a 2-week smartphone program that involves looking at
      pictures. Participants will complete short tasks and answer some questions about their eating
      habits and mood on the smartphone.

    <textblock>
      Over 30% of adolescents are overweight and 20% are obese, but the mechanisms that produce
      excessive weight gain in youth remain incompletely elucidated. Some overweight youth appear
      to have an attention bias (AB: a tendency to attend selectively to stimuli that have acquired
      salience or meaning) toward highly palatable food that may lead to overeating. AB involves
      distinct cognitive processes, (1) unconscious reactions (UCR), reflecting initial attention
      capture evoked by salient stimuli, and (2) continued attention deployment (AD) to stimuli
      relevant to current goals. These rapidly evolving processes are associated with unique
      neurocircuitry best measured using high spatial resolution and temporal sensitivity.
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a novel neuroimaging technology that has both excellent
      temporal and good spatial resolution, thus is uniquely and ideally suited to study
      neurocognitive mechanisms of AB. Reducing AB to palatable foods may help some overweight
      youth curb their consumption of energy-dense options. Attention retraining (AR) programs can
      be used to reduce AB and have been effective in reducing AB to unhealthy food in adults.
      Although most AR studies involve computers in the laboratory, using smartphones in the
      natural environment may be a particularly effective method to deliver AR to adolescents and
      measure AB using ecological momentary assessment. The first aim of the proposed study is to
      examine the impact

      the a 2-week smartphone AR program on AB in overweight adolescent (12-17 y/o) girls with and
      without loss of control (LOC) eating, defined as a subjective experience of a lack of control
      over what or how much one is eating. LOC is a distinct eating behavior phenotype in youth
      that is a risk factor for excess weight gain and disordered eating, and is much more
      prevalent among girls (vs. boys). Overweight youth who report LOC may be particularly
      susceptible to AB. Additionally, adults with LOC demonstrate AB toward socially threatening
      cues, such as angry or disapproving faces, and the AB to social threat may be relevant to the
      relationship between AB to food and overweight. The second aim is to examine, using MEG, the
      effect of a 2-week smartphone AR program on neural responses to food cues. The third aim is
      to examine the effect of the AR program on food intake and body composition. An exploratory
      aim is to

      examine whether AB to socially threatening cues, moderates the effects of this novel
      intervention on AB to food cues, food intake, and body composition. The proposed study is
      innovative because no study to date has examined the impact of AR delivered in the natural

      environment on AB and its associated neurocircuitry using MEG in a group of youth prone to
      AB. These studies may help further characterize phenomenology of distinct obesity subtypes
      and may potentially identify an approach that could prevent undue weight gain in adolescent
      girls at risk for obesity.

        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:

          1. Age between 12 and 17 years (at the start of the study).

          2. Female sex.

          3. BMI at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex according to the Centers for
             Disease Control US Standards (101).

          4. Right handedness.

             LOC sample only:

          5. Greater than or equal to 1 episodes of LOC eating during the past month prior to
             assessment, assessed using a clinical diagnostic interview for eating disorders.

             No-LOC sample only:

          6. No episodes of LOC eating during the past month prior to assessment, assessed using a
             clinical diagnostic interview for eating disorders.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals will be excluded (and provided treatment referrals as needed) for the following
        reasons:

          1. An obesity-related health comorbidity requiring medical treatment, such as
             hypertension (defined by age-, sex-, and height-specific standards) or fasting
             hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes.

          2. Presence of other major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most
             endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, untreated hyper- or hypothyroidism),
             hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring
             continuous medication). Nonserious

             medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a case-by-case
             basis.

          3. Regular use of any medication known to affect body weight or eating behavior (e.g.,
             stimulants prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD).
             Medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a
             case-by-case basis.

          4. Current pregnancy or a history of pregnancy.

          5. A significant reduction in weight during the past three months, for any reason,
             exceeding 5% of body weight.

          6. Presence in the child of any significant, full-threshold psychiatric disorder based on
             DSM criteria (102), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance
             abuse, anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or any other disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of
             the study. These individuals will not be permitted to enroll in the current study and
             will be referred for treatment. Individuals who present with other psychiatric
             disorders, including subthreshold psychiatric disorders, will be permitted to enroll
             in the study. If, based on the opinion of the investigators, a participant requires
             treatment for his/her psychiatric symptoms, the individual will be referred for
             treatment. Participants who develop any psychiatric disorder or significant
             psychiatric symptoms at any follow-up assessment during the study will be excluded and
             be provided with treatment referrals.

          7. Current and regular substance use, including the use of alcohol and/or tobacco
             products (including e-cigarettes).

          8. A history of significant or recent brain injury that may considerably influence
             performance (i.e., any history of loss of consciousness greater than or equal to 30
             minutes associated with a head injury, any history of memory loss or hospitalization
             associated with a head injury, or greater than or equal to 2 concussions within last
             year).

          9. Current involvement in a weight loss program, participating in psychotherapy aimed at
             weight loss or treatment of eating behavior (e.g., binge eating).

         10. All parents/guardians will be asked to indicate if their child has any food allergies.
             To be conservative, children who report allergies to gluten, nuts, dairy, fruit, or
             any other item in the array, will be excluded from the test meal portion of the study.

         11. A condition under which MEG is contradicted (e.g., metal in the body, pregnancy,
             claustrophobia, history of significant neurological insult or injury).

         12. Non-English speaking participants will be excluded from the study as they may be
             unable to complete questionnaires and follow the instructions which are only provided
             in English.
