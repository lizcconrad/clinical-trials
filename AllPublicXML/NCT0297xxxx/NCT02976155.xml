      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether a standard enteral nutrition protocol can
      improve the efficiency in achieving nutritional goals and improve prognosis in critically ill
      patients.

      As investigators all know, the nutrition status in critically ill patients is associated with
      the prognosis of these patients. And it has been confirmed that early enteral nutrition
      results in better outcome. However,some epidemiological investigation reported that in most
      intensive care unit, the phenomenon of delayed feeding or under feeding are not uncommon. In
      2007, a study reported that the percentage of early enteral nutrition within 48h is 64%,
      based on mechanical ventilated patients in 208 intensive care unit nationally. Other study
      indicated that the calorie supported by the enteral nutrition only constitute 50% of the
      target calorie. Several studies have showed that the application of a standard enteral
      nutrition protocol could result in an improvement in the delivery of enteral feedings to
      patients. However, there is no such study in China.The goal of this study is to evaluate
      whether a standard enteral nutrition protocol can improve the efficiency in achieving
      nutritional goals and improve prognosis in critically ill patients.

    <description>Patients in the experimental arm, the practice of enteral nutrition will based on a standard protocol. The core content of this protocol includes five step：1. Whether the participants need nutrition therapy? 2. The choice of nutrition way? 3. Nasogastric tube or nasointestinal tube? 4. The choice of enteral nutrition type? 5. The target calorie and protein of the participants? And how to achieve these target？(In this study, the practice of the above protocol is the only intervention).</description>
