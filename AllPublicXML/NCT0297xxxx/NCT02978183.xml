  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, modified
      conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The primary endpoints of ocular itching and
      conjunctival redness will be evaluated at the subject's final visit. Subjects who meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (1:1). Randomization
      will be stratified by average post-CAC itching scores at baseline.

      Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and on Days 6, 7 and 8.

          -  be able and willing to avoid all disallowed medication for the appropriate washout
             period and during the study;

          -  have a calculated visual acuity of 0.7 logMAR or better in each eye as measured using
             an ETDRS chart;

          -  have a positive post-CAC reaction;

          -  have a positive post-CAC reaction in two out of the first three time points;

             controlled hypertension or poorly controlled diabetes, a history of status
             asthmaticus, organ transplants, a known history of persistent moderate or severe

             of the study allergens);

          -  manifest signs or symptoms of clinically active allergic conjunctivitis in either eye
             at the screening visit;

             after;
