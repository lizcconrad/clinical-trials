    <textblock>
      This study has the following objective:

      • To validate the capability of the μ-Cor System to monitor ECG, Heart Rate (HR), Respiration
      Rate (RR), Posture and Activity in healthy human subjects.

      The μ-Cor validation will be demonstrated at two body locations:

        1. Side location (below left armpit) for study arm 1, and

        2. Front location (upper left chest) for study arm 2 An FDA-cleared comparator device will
           be used to support the validation of the study device.
