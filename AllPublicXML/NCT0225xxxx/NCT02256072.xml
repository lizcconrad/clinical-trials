      The goal of this study is to develop and test an advance planning tool to help seniors
      understand projected health needs and plan ways to remain in their own homes when these
      crises occur. In this phase of the study through partnerships with seniors, senior community
      groups, area agencies on aging, and home care agencies the investigators are conducting a
      two-armed (attention control and intervention) randomized controlled trial.

      Individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions: attention control or the
      advance planning tool. The investigators attention control group will control for the
      possibility that regular contact with the study team may improve outcomes in participants
      randomized to the intervention website. Participants in the attention control arm will
      navigate an electronic educational session via a National Institute on Aging at NIH Web site
      about physical activity and exercise as it is a topic of interest to seniors. A minimum of 15
      minutes and a maximum of 45 minutes will be allotted for navigating the Web site. The Web
      site is interactive and comparable to the intervention tool:
      http://go4life.nia.nih.gov/get-started).

      If randomized to intervention, subjects will be introduced to the advance planning tool, the
      Plan Your Lifespan website, and given instructions on how to use it. Plan Your Lifespan is a
      Web-based planning tool that provides information for seniors related to advanced health
      planning for home services in specific content areas of: hospitalizations, falls,
      Alzheimer's, dementia, as well as communicating with others. The Plan Your Lifespan website
      is also interactive in that it allows participants to enter their information and share it
      with others to facilitate conversations and decision-making. Participants will navigate and
      complete the Web-based advance planning tool and will be allotted a minimum of 15 minutes and
      a maximum of 45 minutes to navigate the tool as part of the study.

      All participants will be administered a pre- and post-test before and after viewing the
      website they were randomized to. All participants will be followed up at one and three months
      post via a brief phone call where follow-up questions will be asked of all participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seniors over the age of 65 years represent 13.1% of the United States population, with a
      projected 36% increase to 55 million by the year 2020. With advancing age, seniors experience
      an increased prevalence in memory loss, physical disability, and multiple chronic conditions
      (e.g., heart disease, emphysema, stroke, diabetes, cancers, hypertension, arthritis,
      osteoporosis, and macular degeneration). A large fear among seniors is loss of independence
      and removal from their homes to be placed in a nursing home. Seniors who remain in their own
      homes tend to have greater satisfaction, less depression, and maintain their physical
      function better than seniors residing in assisted living or nursing homes. Although remaining
      in the home is of utmost importance, many frail seniors teeter between safe living and
      personal endangerment. Falls, illness, and worsening memory all jeopardize a senior's
      independence and ability to remain in his or her home.

      The advance planning tool, Plan Your Lifespan, provides information that will help older
      Americans to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in their lives as necessary. An established plan would offer
      guidance toward obtaining those resources and professional services that would be useful to
      the senior. An effective plan would be dynamic and adaptable to the senior's changing health
      needs.

      The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the advance planning
      tool to determine subject understanding of home care services, advanced health planning, and
      other patient-centered outcomes. The investigators also hypothesize the following:

      H1: Compared to participants in the attention control group and controlling for baseline
      assessments, participants receiving the advance planning tool will show increased planning
      with regard to implementation/behavior, perception, and intention (measured via the Planning
      Assessment tool) one month after intervention.

      H2: Compared to participants in the attention control group and controlling for baseline
      assessments, participants receiving the advance planning tool will show increased confidence
      in accessing home services (measured via the Confidence in Accessing Home Services tool) one
      month after intervention.

      H3: Compared to participants in the attention control group and controlling for baseline
      assessments, participants receiving the advance planning tool will show increased
      understanding of home services (measured via the Understanding of Home Services tool) one
      month after intervention.

      H4: Compared to participants in the attention control group and controlling for baseline
      assessments, participants receiving the advance planning tool will be more likely to report
      communicating their preferences about issues related to lifespan planning to people who may
      need to make decisions for them (measured via the Communication about Lifespan Planning
      Questionnaire) after study intervention.

      H5: Compared to participants in the attention control group, participants randomized to the
      advance planning tool will report overall satisfaction with the intervention/attention
      control (measured via the Satisfaction with Intervention tool).

      The total duration of the intervention for each participant will be three months with
      assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and two follow-up assessments at one and three
      months for a total of 4 data collection points.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is planning behavior score (ranging from 5-25 points; where higher values are considered to be a better outcome) at one month post-intervention/attention control as measured by the &quot;Planning Implementation (Behavior)&quot; assessment. The outcome measure will be assessed at baseline and one month from baseline. Primary endpoint analyses will consist of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) comparing mean planning behavior score at one month post-intervention/attention control while controlling for baseline planning behavior score. All analyses will assume a type I error rate of 5%.</description>

        <title>Planning Behavior Score at 1-month</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint for this study is planning behavior score (ranging from 5-25 points; where higher values are considered to be a better outcome) at one month post-intervention/attention control as measured by the “Planning Implementation (Behavior)” assessment. The outcome measure will be assessed at baseline and one month from baseline. Primary endpoint analyses will consist of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) comparing mean planning behavior score at one month post-intervention/attention control while controlling for baseline planning behavior score. All analyses will assume a type I error rate of 5%.</description>
