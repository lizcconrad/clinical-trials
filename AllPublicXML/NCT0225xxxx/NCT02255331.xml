  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a total hip replacement may require early revision surgery due to an adverse
      local tissue reaction or bone resorption that occurs due to wear debris released from the
      implant. A non-invasive imaging biomarker does not exist to identify or to follow total hip
      replacement patients who are most at risk for suffering this type of premature implant
      failure. This study will evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker to predict
      a failing hip replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) with metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) bearing materials have
      excellent survival rates but a common cause for implant failure is aseptic loosening caused
      by biologic reaction to wear debris. Alternative bearing surfaces, such as ceramics and
      metals, were developed as an alternative to MOP to reduce osteolysis due to polyethylene
      wear.

      The use of metal-on-metal (MOM) hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) implants was initially
      advocated due to the perceived advantages over MOP; however, reactions to MOM wear debris in
      the expanded capsule have become a common cause of premature implant failure due to adverse
      local tissue reactions. Furthermore, monitoring local response to an implants requires high
      soft tissue contrast, as the adverse reactions are generated by the host synovial response.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has superior soft tissue contrast but has traditionally been
      limited by the artifact generated by the components.

      In this study, the investigators propose to develop MRI as a biomarker to detect adverse
      local tissue reactions for all bearing combinations and modular connections in THA.
      Individuals indicated for revision THA surgery will be recruited for pre-operative MRI
      studies, intra-operative tissue sampling for histologic analysis, and post-operative wear
      analysis of the retrieved implant. Correlations between the MRI datasets and the histologic
      and wear assessments will be performed and will be used to develop a predictive diagnostic
      tool for the management of THA patients. This predictive tool will be applied to cohort of
      individuals with primary THA to longitudinally monitor disease progression in patients with
      different individual risk factors and implant bearing surfaces.

    <measure>Mode of total hip arthroplasty failure</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 1 year post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be classified as symptomatic with mechanical symptoms and symptomatic with unexplained pain. These groups are based on the categories used by the National Joint Registry of England and Wales. Patients presenting with loosening, instability, or malalignment will be classified as &quot;mechanical&quot; failure. In cases of loosening, patients will be categorized as having acetabular or femoral loosening, only when documented intra-operatively by the surgeon. Patients presenting with pain not attributable to implant loosening, instability, or component malposition will be classified as &quot;unexplained&quot; failure. No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Intraoperative damage assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement during revision surgery for total hip arthroplasty patients</time_frame>
    <description>A subjective scoring system will be used for intraoperative damage assessment of the hip joint. The system is based on a 0 to 3 scale denoting the level of involvement of the soft tissues surrounding the joint (capsule, synovium, and muscle): 0 = Normal tissue; 1 = Fluid collection ± mild synovial reaction with or capsular dehiscence; 2 = the same findings as a score of 1, but with moderate synovial reaction; and 3 = the same findings as a score of 2, but with the addition of damage to the abductor muscle and/or osteolysis. No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Histologic analysis of retrieved tissues</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement at an expected average of 1 year post operatively for revision total hip arthroplasty patients.</time_frame>
    <description>Histological evaluation will be using a 10 point aseptic lymphocytic vasculitis associated lesion (ALVAL) score to assess tissue reaction to a total hip replacement. The ALVAL score is a summation of individual grades assigned to the integrity of the synovial lining, presence and extent of inflammatory cell infiltrates, necrosis and tissue organization.
We will use a supplemental grading system intended for metal-on-poly and ceramic implants since ALVAL grading is used primarily for metal-on-metal (MOM) articulations and may not detect similar features of wear debris in non-MOM articulations, polyethylene, metal or corrosion products. The presence of ceramic and polyethylene particles and the relative number of macrophages, giant cells, histiocytes, acute or chronic inflammatory cells, and presence of necrotic tissue will be graded using the scale of: 1) absent (-), little (+), moderate (++), extensive (+++). No specific unit of measure will be used for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>The bearing surfaces of the femoral heads and acetabular components, the neck trunnion of the total hip replacement femoral stems, and the matching female tapers of the total hip replacement heads retrieved at surgery will be scanned with a technique that utilizes a non-contact measurement method to calculate volumetric wear (measurement units of mm^3) and linear wear (measurement units of mm).</description>
