  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine specific changes in muscle secretory profile
      (myokines, miRNA) in association with neurodegenerative disease progression and metabolic
      dysfunction. Next the investigators would like to determine the shift in the muscle secretory
      activity induced by regular exercise intervention, which the investigators think could be
      translated into the beneficial changes in clinical phenotypes, determined by neuroimaging,
      cognitive function tests and metabolic phenotyping.

      Standard Operating Procedures for patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data
      analysis routinely used in University Hospital Bratislava and in Institute of Experimental
      Endocrinology Slovak Academy of Sciences will be employed.

      Statistical analysis will be employed to address the primary and secondary objectives, as
      specified in the study protocol.
