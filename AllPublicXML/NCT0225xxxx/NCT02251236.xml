      The project will have two tracks, one for participants who are currently taking
      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or E/C/F/tenofovir
      alafenamide (E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF) single-tablet regimen* (STR) (Track A) and one for
      participants who will begin therapy with E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF STR during the study (Track
      B).

      Participants will take E/C/F/TDF and/or E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (E/C/F/TAF)
      STR** (if available) for 24 weeks.

      *Co-formulation of 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and
      300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

      **Co-formulation of 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine,
      and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.

      ﻿﻿The proposed project will be a prospective, open-label treatment trial of 14 HIV-infected
      adults. Participants will be enrolled in two tracks. Track A will enroll participants who
      have been taking E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF for at least 12 weeks. Track B will enroll
      participants who are not taking ART and no prior exposure to elvitegravir and no genotypic
      drug resistance to any component of E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF. CSF and blood will be collected
      twice in Track A (two on-treatment assessments) and three times in Track B (one
      pre-treatment, two on-treatment assessments). If possible, we plan to time assessments to
      bridge the transition from E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF so that all participants will ideally have
      one CSF collection on each regimen, enabling a paired comparison of tenofovir concentrations
      between the two tenofovir formulations. We estimate that 28 on-treatment CSF collections will
      be sufficient to provide a small-sample estimate of the distribution of elvitegravir,
      tenofovir and TAF into CSF.
