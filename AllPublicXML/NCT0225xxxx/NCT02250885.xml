             guidelines

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Patients must have a tissue diagnosis of any of the following:

               -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic
                  neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET)

               -  Poorly differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary origin

          -  Measurable disease: Any primary and/or metastatic mass reproducibly measurable in one
             or two diameters by RECIST 1.1 parameters by cat scan (CT) scan.

          -  Objective evidence of tumor progression within 4 months prior to study entry, as
             defined by serial cat scan (CT) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. (At least a 20% increase in
             the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition, the sum must also demonstrate an
             absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also
             considered progression).

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy and must have
             exhausted any other standard-of-care treatment option.

          -  Prior radiation and surgery is allowed. At least 3 weeks should have elapsed from
             surgery, chemotherapy, hepatic embolization/ chemoembolization or radioactive isotopes
             (i.e. Yttrium 90). In any case, disease progression must be documented after
             treatment.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

          -  Concomitant octreotide treatment for carcinoid syndrome is allowed for patients whose
             tumor has progressed while on octreotide. Patients must have been on a stable dose of
             octreotide two weeks prior to enrollment and must remain on a stable dose during the
             study.

          -  Hematological function:

               -  Total white blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 2,000/mm³

               -  Absolute neutrophil (ANC) &gt; 1,000/mm³

               -  Platelet &gt;100,000mm³

          -  Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to C1D1: total direct bilirubin &lt;2
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN; 1.0 mg/dL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             &lt;2.5 times ULN (30 U/L). In the case of known (radiological and/or biopsy documented)
             liver metastasis, ALT &lt;5.0 times ULN is acceptable.

          -  Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to C1D1: estimated creatinine clearance of
             ≥ 30 mL/min, calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault: (140-Age) • Mass
             (kg)/(72 • creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if female.

          -  Blood electrolytes should be within the following normal limits:

        Bicarbonate (total) 18-30 mEq/L Sodium 135-147 mEq/L Potassium 3.5-5.5 mEq/L Phosphorus
        1.8-2.3 mEq/L Magnesium 1.5-3.0 mEq/L Chloride 98-106 mEq/L Calcium (total) 4.5-5.5 mEq/L

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of
             contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male patients
             must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female
             of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with
             contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive
             patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is
             surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both male and female patients, effective
             methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three months
             following the last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients with the following tumor types: lung carcinoid, pheochromocytomas,

             features not listed in the inclusion criteria

          -  Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy ≤3 weeks
             prior to C1D1

          -  Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive

          -  Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for hepatitis C
             virus (HCV RNA) or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen)

          -  Any underlying condition that would significantly interfere with the absorption of an
             oral medication

          -  Patients who have active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Asymptomatic small
             lesions are not considered active. Treated lesions may be considered inactive if they
             are stable for at least 3 months. Patient with malignant cells in their cerebrospinal
