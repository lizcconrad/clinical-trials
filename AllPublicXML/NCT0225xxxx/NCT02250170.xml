  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized trial will comprise of 2 parts. A dose escalation part will
      characterize the safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics of OPB-111077 in advanced solid
      tumor. Subsequently, an expansion part will further evaluate the biomarker, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of OPB-111077 in selected tumor types.

  <detailed_description>

      This trial is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and
      recommended dose of OPB-111077 administered orally 4-days on and 3-days off (3 weeks/cycle)
      to subjects with advanced solid tumor in the dose escalation part so that biomarkers,
      efficacy, and others can be evaluated at the recommended dose in an expeditious manner in the
      expansion part. The dose escalation part employs a 3+3 escalation design as a standard dose
      escalation design for a small sample size.
