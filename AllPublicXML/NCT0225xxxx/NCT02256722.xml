  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to compare the metabolic and electrolyte effects of a single oral dose of 320 mg
      ritobegron administered alone or with a pre- and comedication with bisoprolol, propranolol
      and acipimox. In addition, to compare the metabolic and electrolyte effects of a single dose
      of 320 mg ritobegron with those of a single inhalatory dose of 100 μg salmeterol
