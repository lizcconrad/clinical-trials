  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable urothelial cancer that has
      recurred or progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to
      receive pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The
      primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab will prolong Overall Survival (OS) and
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine.

      Effective with Amendment 15, eligible participants who were allocated to the Active
      Comparator arm and experienced disease progression will be provided with the opportunity to
      crossover to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg one time every three weeks (Q3W) for up to two
      years of treatment in the Crossover Phase of the study.

      For the purposes of this study, participants with a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      combined proportion score (CPS) ≥10% were considered to have a strongly PD-L1 positive tumor
      status and participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1% were considered to have a PD-L1 positive tumor
      status.

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 was assessed by blinded independent radiologist review in all participants up through the database cutoff date of 07-Sep-2016.</description>

For the purposes of this study, participants with a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined proportion score (CPS) ≥10% were considered to have a strongly PD-L1 positive tumor status. The OS was assessed in all participants who had strongly PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥10%) up through the database cutoff date of 07-Sep-2016.</description>
