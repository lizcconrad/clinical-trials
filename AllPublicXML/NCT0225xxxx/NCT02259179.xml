  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover study in healthy
      adult subjects to assess the bioequivalence of naltrexone SR/bupropion SR combination
      trilayer tablets prepared at two different manufacturing sites. The pharmacokinetics of the
      two drug products will be evaluated separately in the fed and fasted state.

          1. Male or female, 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive

          2. Be in good general health, without any clinically significant medical history,
             physical examination findings, or laboratory results at Screening or Day -1

          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute (within 28 days of Day -1) or chronic illness

          2. History (within the last 20 years) of seizures, cranial trauma, bulimia, anorexia
             nervosa, or other conditions that may predispose the subject to seizures; or previous
             medical treatment with anticonvulsants of any type

             caffeine/xanthine-containing foods or beverages for 48 hours before study drug intake
             in each treatment period (Days 1 and 15) until 72 hours postdose (Days 4 and 18)

         15. Inability or unwillingness to consume a standardized high-fat breakfast as provided at
             the study clinic on Days 1 and 15

         16. Inability to comply with all required study procedures and schedule, inability to
             speak and read English, or unwillingness or inability to give written informed consent
