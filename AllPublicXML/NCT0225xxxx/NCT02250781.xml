      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Oral ONC201 in treating patients
      with advanced solid tumors. Oral ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of single agent ONC201 orally once every three
      weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic
      response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single agent
      in advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for a total of 2
      courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
