    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of Depersonalization Disorder (DPD). TMS applies
      a magnetic field to the brain for a brief period of time. TMS is a procedure that involves 30
      minute-long daily sessions every weekday for a series of weeks. The investigators are testing
      whether TMS can treat Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      This study is a research trial of an outpatient, non-medication, non-invasive investigational
      treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is a noninvasive tool for the
      study of the human brain that has been approved by the FDA for use in depression, but it is
      also being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for other symptoms, such as those
      seen in Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      TMS applies a magnetic field to the brain for a brief period of time. TMS is a procedure that
      involves 30 minute-long daily sessions every weekday for a series of weeks. The investigators
      are testing whether TMS can treat Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      In this trial, 32 adult outpatients with DPD, that have been only partially responsive to
      conventional therapies, will be treated with active or sham low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS applied
      to the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) daily for up to six weeks.

      DPD symptoms will be monitored through weekly self-report questionnaires as well clinical
      ratings with a doctor.

    <description>The outcome of subjects randomized to active rTMS in phase 1 will be assessed as the change from baseline after 6 weeks of daily rTMS (week 6 assessment). Subjects randomized to receive sham in phase 1 will be assessed at baseline and week 6, but the primary method of assessing improvement will be the change between the baseline and week 12 scores (i.e. after receiving 6 weeks of active rTMS).
Scale item number: 29 Item score range: Frequency: 0 - 4, Duration: 0-5 Minimum CDS score: 0 Maximum CDS score: 261
Higher scores indicate the presence of high symptom severity. Decrease in scores from baseline reflects clinical symptom improvement.</description>

Higher scores indicate the presence of high symptom severity. Decrease in scores from baseline reflects clinical symptom improvement.
Patients will be classified as responders with a CGI-S = 1 or 2; and partial responders CGI-S = 3.
