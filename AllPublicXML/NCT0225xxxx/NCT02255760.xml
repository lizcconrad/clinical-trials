      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study
      evaluating the safety and tolerability of a single ascending IV dose of MEDI3902 in healthy
      adult subjects 18 to 60 years of age. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled across 4
      fixed dose cohorts at 1 study site. This study will last approximately 90 days, constituting
      a screening period of up to 28 days, 1 day of investigational product administration, and a
      60 day safety follow up period.
