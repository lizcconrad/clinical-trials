      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      preliminary safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when administered in conjunction with oral
      dabrafenib and trametinib (D+T) in patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IV metastatic melanoma
             positive for BRAF V600E or V600K by a CLIA approved assay.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients must have adequate baseline organ function as determined by table 2. Table 2.
             Definitions for adequate baseline organ function System Laboratory Values Hematologic
             ANC

               -  1.2 × 109/L Hemoglobin

               -  9 g/dL Platelet count

               -  100 x 109/L PT/INRa and PTT

                    -  1.3 x ULN Hepatic Total bilirubin

                    -  1.5 x ULNc AST and ALT

                    -  2.5 x ULN Renal Serum creatinineb

                    -  1.5 mg/dL Cardiac Left Ventricular Ejection fraction (LVEF)d

               -  LLN by ECHO Abbreviations: ALT = alanine transaminase; ANC = absolute neutrophil
                  count; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; INR = international normalized ratio;
                  LLN = lower limit of normal; PT = prothrombin time; PTT = partial thromboplastin
                  time; ULN = upper limit of normal.

        Subjects receiving anticoagulation treatment may be allowed to participate with INR
        established within the therapeutic range prior to randomization.

        If serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, calculate creatinine clearance using standard
        Cockcroft-Gault formula. Creatinine clearance must be ≥ 50 mL/min to be eligible.

        Except subjects with known Gilbert's syndrome. ECHO scans must be used throughout the study
        when indicated

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum
             pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥
             1 year. Women must use an effective method of contraception from 14 days prior to
             randomization, throughout the treatment period, and for at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of
             contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than
             1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables,
             or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods
             of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the
             patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.) Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are NOT permitted
             as contraception due to potential drug-drug interactions with dabrafenib.

          -  Patients with brain metastases treated with whole brain radiation that have been
             stable for 2 months are eligible; patients with brain metastases treated with gamma
             knife or surgery are allowed to participate after 3 weeks have elapsed since their
             procedure . Demonstration of brain stability by an imaging study after the procedure
             is required for gamma knife or CNS surgery patients. Subjects are excluded if they
             have leptomeningeal or metastases causing spinal cord compression that are symptomatic
             or untreated or not stable for ≥3 months (must be documented by imaging) or requiring
             corticosteroids. Subjects on a stable dose of corticosteroids &gt;1 month or who have
             been off of corticosteroids for at least 1 week can be enrolled with approval of the
             medical monitor

             or chemotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and oral targeted therapy
             at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study. Patients must not receive any other
             investigational anticancer therapy during the period on study or the four weeks prior
             to entry.

          -  All prior anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities (except alopecia and laboratory
             values as listed in Eligibility Criteria #4) must be Grade 1 according to the Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE version 4.03, 2009) at the
             time of starting treatment. Patients that are asymptomatic on low dose maintenance
             hormone replacement delivered at a stable dose for prior toxicities are eligible.

          -  Patient much have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known serious concurrent infection or medical illness, including
             psychiatric disorders, which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive
             the treatment outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

        subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible

          -  History of malignancy with confirmed activating RAS mutation at any time. Note:
             Prospective RAS testing is not required. However, if the results of previous RAS
             testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or chronic pneumonitis

          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with porphyria or psoriasis are
