  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability, characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and
      identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of Elotuzumab administered in combination with
      either Lirilumab or Urelumab in subjects with multiple myeloma.
