      The main objective of this proposed study is to identify unique DNA sequences within the
      genome of human scabies that can be utilized to identify the parasite through polymerase
      chain reaction or PCR. The goal of the project is to design an assay that can distinguish
      samples from skin scrapings containing scabies mites, eggs, or fecal material confirmed by
      clinic based microscopic evaluation (gold standard) from negative controls (i.e. scrapings
      for tinea and/or demodex folliculitis) that do not contain Sarcoptes scabiei. We hypothesize
      that specifically amplifying the unique regions of the Scabies genome using PCR can serve as
      a means to diagnosis infestations in humans. To address this question, we will optimize PCR
      amplification of known scabies samples then apply our procedure to DNA extracted from patient
      samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Male/Female of all ages whose standard clinical treatment produces one or more of
             the following:

               -  Slides from skin scrapings containing scabies mites, eggs, and/or fecal material

               -  Slides from skin scrapings of suspected tinea

               -  Slides from skin scrapings of demodex mites

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients who are clinically concerning for having both scabies and tinea/demodex
             folliculitis to avoid contamination of positive and negative controls in the same
             sample. Subjects or guardians who cannot understand and read English and so are unable
             to consent to participation.
