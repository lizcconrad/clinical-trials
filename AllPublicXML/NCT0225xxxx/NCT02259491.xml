  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since antiquity, honey has been recognized for its healing properties. Literature about the
      use of medicinal honey for wound care dates back centuries with recent data suggesting its
      use in patients suffering from burns or pressure ulcers. Research has shown Manuka honey
      (Leptospermum scoparium) to have significant immune benefits and the ability to influence all
      phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation and remodeling. In addition, numerous
      clinical studies have identified positive benefits for wound healing. However, there is a
      lack of prospective, randomized controlled data on the use of honey as a medicinal agent in
      local wound care and scar healing.

      In order to better understand Manuka Honey's ability to aid in healing, the investigators are
      conducting a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing
      reconstructive surgery. This project uses split thickness skin graft and free tissue transfer
      donor sites as standard wound models to compare the effects of Manuka Honey versus standard
      wound care therapies. Through the use of standard wound model and objective measurement
      tools, the investigators hope to better elucidate any benefits of this novel wound care
      'technology.'

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Free tissue transfer (FTT) and split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) are important aspects of
      head and neck reconstruction. The radial forearm skin flap and fibula osteocutaneous flap are
      commonly used in head and neck reconstruction. After harvest, closure of these donor sites
      often requires split thickness skin grafting. The grafting is usually done from the thigh.
      The grafted free flap donor site along with the STSG donor site is often the source of
      significant post-operative pain and complications including delayed wound healing, graft loss
      and infection. There is no consensus in the literature on the best care for these donor sites
      with surgeons employing a wide variety of surgical dressings for local wound care. There is
      literature dating back centuries on the use of medicinal honey for wound care, with recent
      data suggesting its use in patients suffering from burns or pressure ulcers. However, there
      is a lack of prospective, randomized controlled data on the use of honey as a medicinal agent
      in local wound care.

    <description>After surgical resection and reconstruction the skin graft donor site (thigh) and the free flap donor site will be dressed with Medihoney surgical dressings. More specifically, a dressing of appropriate size will be applied to the anterior thigh and covered with tegaderm. For the STSG recipient site a Medihoney dressing will cover the skin graft, followed by dry gauze, kerlex and a cast.</description>
