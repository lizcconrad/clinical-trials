  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atrial fibrillation are exposed to a high risk of thrombus in the left atrium
      that can induce cerebral vascular events or systemic embolisms. This justifies the
      prescription of anticoagulant therapies in patients with high risk of thromboembolic event.
      Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure is a new interventional strategy for patients with
      high risk of cardiovascular events and a counter-indication for long term treatment with
      anticoagulant agents. However, only few data are available on effectiveness and prognosis of
      patients treated by this new interventional strategy.

      This national database record per-procedure and follow-up data of patients treated by left
      atrial appendage closure.

      This database is strictly observational.

      Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure is performed only for the purpose of patient care.
      No specific intervention is performed specifically for the database. Neither left atrial
      appendage closure procedure nor patient follow up are modified by patient inclusion in the
      database.
