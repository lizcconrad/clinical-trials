  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine is in many cases a most disabling condition. Chronic migraine is defined as
      headaches for at least 15 days per month, of which 8 days have typical migraine features. In
      many cases, oral drug treatment has little effect.

      The parasympathetic nervous system acting through the sphenopalatine ganglion may be involved
      in several primary headaches, including migraine, by facilitating release of inflammatory
      substances in cerebral vessels. Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) inhibits excretion of
      acetylcholine resulting in blocking of nerve signals in the sphenopalatine ganglion.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate a new technique with injection of BTA using
      an minimal invasive image guided procedure, for blocking of the sphenopalatine ganglion. The
      goal is to relieve the migraine symptoms and develop an alternate treatment for cases where
      oral drug treatments fail.

      The main objective of the project is to determine the safety of this method of BTA injection
      in the area of the sphenopalatine ganglion by detecting adverse events. Secondary objectives
      are to measure changes in headache attack parameters with this novel method.
