  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of drugs can help to treat breast
      cancer. This is a Phase II study which will test whether this combination of drugs is
      effective and will provide further information on side effects and safety. A standard
      chemotherapy, gemcitabine, will be combined with 2 other drugs that target the HER2 receptor.
      The HER2 receptor is a growth protein on the surface of some breast cancer cells that
      provides messages telling the breast cancer cell to grow. The standard chemotherapy will be
      gemcitabine.. The other two drugs work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin)
      and it is commonly given to women with advanced and early HER2 positive breast cancer. The
      other drug, pertuzumab (Perjeta), is also given to women with advanced HER2 positive breast
      cancer. The drugs in this study are each individually approved for the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer. However, this study is looking at the effectiveness of gemcitabine
      with trastuzumab and pertuzumab when given to women who have advanced HER2 positive breast
      cancer who have had prior trastuzumab + pertuzumab or pertuzumab-based therapy.

    <description>The regimen will consist of gemcitabine at 1000mg/m^2 IV weekly days 1 + 8 q 3 weeks + trastuzumab every 3 weeks (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) + pertuzumab every 3 weeks (840 mg as a loading dose followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks), all given intravenously (IV). Trastuzumab may be given IV weekly (4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) in lieu of the every 3 week schedule. A loading dose of trastuzumab will not be required for patients who have received it &lt; 6 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.</description>
