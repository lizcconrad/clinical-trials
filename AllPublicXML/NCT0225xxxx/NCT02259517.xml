  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are typically treated with two
      types of medications with differing mechanisms of action: stimulants and non-stimulants. The
      stimulant Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine, LDX), and the non-stimulant Intuniv (extended-release
      guanfacine, GXR), are both FDA approved treatment for ADHD. Clinical trials have shown that
      both medications are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, although the neurobiological
      mechanisms by which Vyvanse and Intuniv produce these effects remain unknown. The aim of this
      study is to examine the mechanisms by which LDX and GXR reduce symptoms in patients with
      ADHD. MRI scanning will be used to identify treatment-related changes in brain structure and
      function.

      Children with ADHD and age and sex-matched healthy controls will be scanned at the beginning
      of the study. In this first part of the study, MRI findings will be compared between the two
      groups to see whether brain functioning of children with ADHD differs from that of healthy
      children. In the second part of the study, the children with ADHD will meet weekly with the
      study doctor and be administered either extended-release guanfacine (Intuniv) or
      lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) for 6 weeks. Selection into either treatment group will be
      randomly determined. At the end of the study, the children with ADHD treated with either
      medication will have a second MRI scan. The findings of that second MRI scan will be compared
      to the first MRI scan in order to examine brain changes due to the medication. These second
      MRI scans will also be compared to the scans of the healthy controls.
