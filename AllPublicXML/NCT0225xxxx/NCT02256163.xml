      The primary objectives of the study are

        -  to assess the contribution of alteration of each known gene on non-syndromic TAA.

        -  to map and identify unknown gene involved in the non-syndromic TAA.

      The secondary objectives of the study are

        -  to study the correlation of phenotype-genotype, in particular, to compare the aortic
           phenotype of non-syndromic TAA patients and TAA syndromic patients.

        -  to develop national standardized strategies of genetic diagnosis and of clinical
           management using genetic data.

          -  Aged &gt; 18 years.

          -  Written informed consent obtained.

          -  People with health insurance.

        For individual:

          -  people ≥ 45 years, thoracic aortic aneurysm without syndrome,

          -  or people &gt; 45 years with familial TAA.

        For family:

          -  At least 2 members of family in 2 generations have TAA without syndrome and at least 2
             patients of TAA will undergo blood collection.

          -  All people in family will undergo blood collection, each member should declare at
             first his (her) status (with or without TAA, unknown), the relationship (direct
             relative family or family in-law), no limit of age. For the children, only those with
             TAA will perform blood collection for the study.
