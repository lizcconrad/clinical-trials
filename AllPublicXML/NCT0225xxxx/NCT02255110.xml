      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, Japanese multicenter trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of TH-302 in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with locally
      advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects with Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 months: independent-read assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of Subjects with Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the treated subjects without progression or occurrence of death due to any cause. PFS is defined as time from first dose to either first observation of progressive disease (PD) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Version 1.1) or occurrence of death due to any cause up to 63 days following the last response assessment (or from start of treatment for subjects without a response assessment), whichever occurs first. In subjects without a progression date or with a death date more than 63 days after the last tumor assessment, the PFS time will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment. Subjects with no tumor assessment available and who have neither progressed nor died will be censored on the day of start of therapy. PFS rate will be assessed using Kaplan Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects with Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 3 and 9 months: independent- and investigator-read assessment</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects with Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response is defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall response according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response is defined as time from date of first response to date of disease progression (according to RECIST Version 1.1) or death, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects with 12-month Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after last subject's first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The overall survival (OS) is defined (in months) as the time from start of therapy to occurrence of death due to any cause: (date of death or last date known to be alive - date of start of therapy + 1) / 30.4375. For subjects not known to be deceased at time of analysis, the time between the date of start of therapy and date of last contact or date lost to follow-up will be calculated and used as a censored observation in the analysis. If this date is after the data cut-off, subjects will be censored at the date of data cut-off.</description>
