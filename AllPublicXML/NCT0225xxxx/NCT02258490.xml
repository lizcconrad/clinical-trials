  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established form of treatment
      for hematological abnormalities. Poor graft function, occurs when there poor donor
      engraftment. A second infusion of unselected donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can result
      in improvement, but can potentially increase the incidence of graft versus host disease.
      Cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) selected stem cells depleted of T-cells is an
      attractive alternative for treatment of poor graft function as it may be associated with less
      Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) and enhanced count recovery. The investigators are using the
      Miltenyi CliniMACS device and CD34 cell selection reagents for the preparation of allogeneic
      hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplants for patients who have had prior stem cell
      transplants and require a stem cell &quot;boost&quot; from the original donor.

      This is a single-arm, open label, single institution, compassionate study which will enroll
      patients who are marginally engrafted and transfusion and/or growth factors dependent after
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) regardless of the underlying disease for
      which the transplant was performed. Study subjects will receive a &quot;booster&quot; infusion of CD34+
      cell selected and T-cell depleted G-CSF mobilized apheresis product from the original stem
      cell donor in order to improve engraftment. The &quot;booster&quot; infusion will be administered
      without prior conditioning.

    <description>Mobilization of Donor: Following screening and enrollment after informed consent, the donor will receive mobilization therapy with G-CSF (10 ug/Kg S/C daily x5-6 days) using the standard National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) guidelines.
CD34+ selection with CliniMACS device: CD34+ cell selection will be performed according to procedures given in the CliniMACS Users Operating Manual and institutional Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). If the donor's plasma is not available, CliniMACS buffer will be used.
The Day of CD34+ cell infusion: Immediately after the release tests have been performed and the product passes the release criteria, the patient will receive the final product. No conditioning regimen will be administered prior to cell infusion.</description>
