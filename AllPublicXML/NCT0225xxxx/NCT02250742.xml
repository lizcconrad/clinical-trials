    <textblock>
      The study will establish data on the function of trunk muscles in healthy and low back pain
      patient's pre and post dry needling treatment. This will help in understanding the underlying
      mechanism of this treatment and reveal the effect of dry needling on muscle performance.

      Study hypothesis is that an improvement of back muscle function following dry needling
      procedure will be found.

      Dry needling of muscles is mainly used for the management of pain in musculoskeletal
      disorders. Yet, the association between dry needling and motor performance of muscles is
      still unclear.

      This study aims to investigate the immediate effect of dry needling on lumbar multifidus
      muscles' function in healthy and low back pain subjects.

      The sample will be divided into: low back pain group and control (healthy) group. Both groups
      will receive dry needling to the lumbar multifidus muscles using a deep insertion technique
      with 4 needles (2 on each side of the spine). The needles will be left in situ for 10
      minutes. Ultrasound imaging will be used to measure multifidus muscles' thickness, pre and
      post- procedure during rest in a prone position and during contralateral active straight leg
      extension.

    <description>Dry needling uses traditional acupuncture needles without injecting any liquid. Dry needling is based on traditional Western medicine whereby the needle insertion sites are located in known anatomical landmarks such as skeletal muscles, fascia and occasionally joints, tendons and bone/tendon junctions.</description>
