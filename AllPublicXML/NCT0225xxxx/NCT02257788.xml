      Protocol PRO 140 2103 is a multicenter, randomized parallel group study, conducted in
      approximately 40 male and female adult subjects (n=10/treatment group) infected with
      CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Subjects will be randomized into one of four treatment groups. Blood
      samples for drug concentrations, PD variables, and efficacy variables will be obtained over a
      59-day period following initiation of dosing. Safety will be monitored throughout the course
      of the study.
