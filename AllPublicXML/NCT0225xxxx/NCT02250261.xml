  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking and cycling to work is a natural way of increasing lifestyle activity in working
      population. In Finland, active travel is acknowledged as one of the key components in the
      most previous policy documents and initiatives related to physical activity promotion.
      However, the evidence on the effectiveness and cost savings of environmental as well as
      social and behavioral strategies in promoting active travel is thin both nationally and
      internationally. This study focuses directly on this gap by 1) conducting a
      cluster-randomized, controlled intervention where environmental change is supported with
      social and behavioral strategies in a large workplace area in Tampere, Finland, 2) assessing
      the cost-effectiveness and health-economic impact of the intervention and 3) examining the
      environmental mediators and moderators of active commuting to work among working aged
      population.

      The study will be conducted in Hatanpää workplace area located just outside the city center
      and including hundreds of workplaces. Workplaces with the minimum of 10 employees are
      contacted for recruitment in August 2014. Baseline information is collected about the
      workplaces (web-based questionnaire), employees (questionnaire, accelerometer, travel log)
      and environment (traffic calculations and audit system, Geographic Information System=GIS)
      first in September-October 2014 and second in March-April 2015.

      In the first phase of the study a cycle superhighway across the workplace area is built by
      the City of Tampere. Its' effects on walking and cycling are assessed after immediate and
      mid-term (6 months) exposure with the same measures as at baseline in September-October 2015
      and second in March-April 2016. In the second phase, the workplaces are randomized to
      intervention and control group based on the most relevant factors related to their
      comparability. Each intervention workplace nominates an internal team, which develops a
      multilevel social ecological plan to promote active commuting to work. The research group
      supports the teams with material, examples and three meetings. The plan is executed in May
      2016 and the effects are assessed in September-October 2016 and March-April 2017. The
      work-places randomized to the control group in the second phase of the study participate only
      in data collection but are offered one supportive meeting for promoting active commuting to
      work after the study.

      Efficiency evaluation based on HEAT (Health economic Assessment Tool, www.euro.who.int/HEAT)
      and costs-to-effectiveness ratios are calculated in the end of the study for the combination
      of both phases as well as for the comparison of the phases. Environmental mediators and
      moderators related to active commuting to work are examined objectively at all evaluation
      points with GIS-analysis by connecting in-formation on physical environment to the routes,
      which employees are using for commuting to work. The information on estimated routes is
      obtained from the questionnaires (home and workplace addresses) and the information on actual
      routes from GPS, which a subgroup of employees will provide by using free-of-charge
      application (e.g. SportsTracker) in their smartphones.
