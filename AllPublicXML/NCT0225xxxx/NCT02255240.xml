      The purpose of this study is to test an intervention that uses home console video games to
      encourage increased physical activity among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.

      This research project includes qualitative and quantitative formative research leading to a
      randomized controlled feasibility trial of a video game-based physical activity intervention.
      First, we will investigate exercise protocols implemented over 6 weeks in 20 breast cancer
      survivors. We will choose a console and six games for inclusion in the trial, based on
      measured energy expenditure and enjoyment. We will create refined exercise protocols using
      these games and insights from participants. Second, we will test an intervention that uses
      active video games for implementation of motivating exercise and provision of behavioral
      tools (e.g., tracking of progress towards goals). Participants in a pre-pilot trial (N = 10)
      will receive weekly brief telephone counseling over 6 weeks. Feasibility measurement will
      include attrition, self-reported acceptability, and objective measures of video game play
      taken from game console data.
