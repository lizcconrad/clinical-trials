          1. Male and female subjects between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive

          2. A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 29 kg/m2

          3. Signed informed consent prior to trial participation

          4. Ability to swallow multiple large capsules without difficulty

          5. Acceptable laboratory values that indicate adequate baseline organ function are
             required at the time of screening. Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable
             if severity was less than or equal to Grade 1, based on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
             (ACTG) Grading Scale. All abnormal laboratory values greater than Grade 1 are subject
             to approval by the trial clinical monitor

          6. Acceptable medical history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are required prior
             to entering the treatment phase of the study. The requirement for chest X-ray is left
             to the investigator's discretion

          7. Willingness to abstain from the following starting 14 days prior to any administration
             of study drug up until the end of the study:

         13. Reasonable probability for completion of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Are not willing to use a reliable method of barrier contraception (such as
                  diaphragm with spermicidal cream/jelly or condoms with spermicidal foam), during
                  the trial and 60 days after completion/termination

               -  Are breast-feeding

          2. Participation in another trial with an investigational medicine within 60 days prior

             resting heart rate either &lt;50 beats/min or &gt;90 beats/min. For subjects with a resting
             heart rate below 50, or above 90, the investigator may discuss their exclusion with
             the clinical monitor on a case-by-case basis

         15. Subjects with history of any illness or allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in
             administering TPV, RTV or RFB to the subject

         16. Subjects who have taken (within 7 days prior to study Day 0) or are taking any
             over-the-counter or prescription drug that, in the opinion of the investigator in
             consultation with the clinical monitor, might interfere with either the absorption,
             distribution or metabolism of the test substances

         17. Known hypersensitivity to TPV, RTV, RFB, or sulphonamide class of drugs

         18. Inability to adhere to the protocol
