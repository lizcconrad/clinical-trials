  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After myopia, the second etiology of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in young adults (&lt;50
      years old) is idiopathic choroidal neovascularization (ICNV) whose etiology remains unknown.
      This is a rare and severe disease, which can lead to blindness.

      ICNV is treated at the moment with off-label anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
      therapy and could also benefit from aflibercept (EYLEA), a new anti-VEGF currently indicated
      in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Case reports suggest that such patients would not
      need as many injections as in AMD.

      INTUITION is an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study. The main
      objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness in clinical terms after 52 weeks of treatment
      with aflibercept on the visual acuity of patients affected by ICNV. A specific dosage regimen
      is designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The patients are followed on a monthly basis until
      52 weeks. Intravitreal injections of aflibercept are initiated with a Treat &amp; Extend (TAE)
      regimen until 20 weeks (3 mandatory injections with reinjection only in case of CNV
      activity). Then, a pro re nata (PRN) regimen is considered until 52 weeks (reinjection in
      case of CNV activity).

    <description>The patients are followed on a monthly basis until 52 weeks. Intravitreal injections of aflibercept at a dosage of 2 mg are initiated with a TAE regimen until 20 weeks (3 mandatory injections at inclusion, week 8 and 20 with reinjection at week 4, 12 and 16 only in case of CNV activity). Then, a PRN regimen is considered until 52 weeks (reinjection in case of CNV activity). Therefore, each patient receives between 3 and 13 injections in the whole study.</description>
