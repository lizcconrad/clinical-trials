  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of BIRT 2584 XX and its metabolite
      BI 610100 when BIRT 2584 XX is administered as a tablet to near steady state in estimated
      high therapeutic dose on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, a probe substrate for
      CYP3A4. The PK of midazolam was measured before dosing of BIRT 2584 XX, after a single dose
      of BIRT 2584 XX and after repeated doses of BIRT 2584 XX for 3 and 12 days
