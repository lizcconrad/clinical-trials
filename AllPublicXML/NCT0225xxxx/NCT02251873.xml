  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to characterise the effects of concurrent tipranavir (TPV) and ritonavir (RTV)
      administration on the single dose pharmacokinetics of didanosine (ddI), to characterise the
      effects of single-dose ddI on the pharmacokinetics of TPV and RTV and to assess the
      short-term safety of this combination
