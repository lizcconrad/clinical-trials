      Primary objectives: To determine the basic pharmacokinetics of BEA 2180 BR, its metabolites
      CD 1975 ZW and CD 1976 ZW and radioactivity including excretion mass balance, excretion
      pathways and metabolism following the oral and intravenous administration of [14C] BEA 2180
      BR

      Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability following single dose oral and iv
      administration of BEA 2180 BR in healthy male volunteers.
