  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The latest randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of resistance training
      performed by older adults reported that the systematic use of exercise in machines improves
      muscle strength and power, functional abilities, body mass and body balance. However, the
      effect of resistance training with elastic tubes exercises have not been studied in all the
      variables described above. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of elastic
      tubes exercises on muscle mass, muscle strength, functional performance and postural control
      in elderly untrained.

      This is a randomized clinical trial study (RCT) with 2 parallel arms. The subjects will be
      divided in 2 groups with a randomized block technique: Elastic Training Group (ETG) and
      Machine Training Group (MTG). The subjects will be submitted to a two-week familiarization
      period and then a sixteen-week of strength training program will be performed twice a week.

      This regimen of resistance training in both groups will consist of four exercises for lower
      limbs and four exercises for upper limbs which will be alternately performed with a
      one-minute interval between them during familiarization and training periods. Lower limb
      exercises will consist of: hip extension and abduction, and knee flexion and extension. Upper
      limb exercises will consist of: bench press, rowing, triceps and high pulley exercise.
