  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every
      year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in
      10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore
      necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this
      cancer is persistent infection with High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus oncogene (HR-HPV).
      Thereby, HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with
      HR-HPV test is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that vaginal
      self-sampling with HPV test is a powerful means to increase the participation rate in
      cervical cancer screening.
