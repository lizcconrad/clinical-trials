      The objective of the study was to determine if the co-administration of loperamide (LOP) with
      tipranavir (TPV), ritonavir (RTV), or TPV plus RTV (TPV/r) caused a clinically significant
      change in the respiratory response to carbon dioxide (CO2), defined as a 10% decrease in the
      area under the pharmacodynamic effect/time curve or at least a 25% decrease in at least one
      pharmacodynamic time point.

             AIDS (DAIDS) Grading Scale. All abnormal laboratory values &gt;Grade 1 (e.g., creatinine
             phosphokinase, amylase, triglycerides) were subject to approval by the clinical
             monitor or designee

          8. Acceptable medical history, physical examination, ECG, and chest x-ray were required
             prior to entering the study
