      A prospective observational study to test the feasibility of smartphone enabled uChek
      urinalysis device to detect biomarkers (protein, microalbumin and protein:creatine ratio) in
      urine, indicative of preeclampsia/eclampsia at over 22 weeks of gestation and assess
      attitudes of clinicians towards uChek as a new technology for urinalysis.

    <description>1. Test the feasibility of using the uChek urinalysis device to detect biomarkers of preeclampsia/eclampsia at over 22 weeks of gestation as compared to using the sites' current urinalysis method. A correlation analysis of the rate of detection of protein in urine between the uChek and the standard visual dipstick test using the quantitative results from the visual dipstick test and uChek results collected at each of three ANC visits.</description>

    <description>Assess impressions, preferences and attitudes of the clinicians towards the uChek as a tool for urinalysis in antenatal care. A quantitative analysis of questionnaire responses about the usability of the device, including but not limited to:
% agree or strongly agree that the uChek is an accurate urinalysis device
% reporting that they agree or strongly agree that uChek is easier to use than current method of urinalysis
% reporting that they agree or strongly agree that uChek is a suitable technology for a low resource setting</description>

    <description>To assess the feasibility of tracking additional biomarkers of conditions affecting pregnant women using urinalysis via the uChek device(glucose for gestational diabetes, nitrites for urinary tract infection, presence of blood, microalbumin for risk of preterm birth, etc.). A quantitative analysis of results of tests for additional biomarkers, detected with the uChek, of conditions affecting pregnant women.</description>

        There are two unique subject populations in this study. One group consists of pregnant
        women whose urine will be analyzed- hereafter referred to as the Patient Participants. The
        second group is a cohort of medical professionals who will answer a questionnaire about the
        usability of the device, relating to the second objective, hereafter referred to as the
        Medical Staff Participants. The following parameters have been answered in reference to the
        Patient Participants.
