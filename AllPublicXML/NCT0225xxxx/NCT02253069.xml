      To study the effect of applying a PHMB-based antiseptic solution to tie-over dressings in
      full-thickness surgical wounds in dermatologic surgery in order to minimise the development
      of surgical site infections. The bacterial dynamics in wounds pre-,intra-, and
      postoperatively will be examined in order to understand the pathogenesis of surgical site
      infections better.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients with suspected skin cancer in the face planned for full-thickness surgery will be
      randomised into two groups: One will receive a traditional tie-over dressing saturated with
      NaCl and the other group will receive a tie-over dressing saturated with a PHMB-based
      antiseptic. A quantitative and qualitative bacterial analysis of wounds by using a modified
      Levine's swabbing technique will be carried out pre-,intra-,and postoperatively. The effect
      of nasal colonisation with S.aureus on the development of surgical site infections will be
      investigated. All wounds will be followed a week after surgery to assess development of
      infections.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring colony forming units in swabs collected from wounds pre-,intra- and postoperatively (7 days after surgery1). Change in bacterial load will be attributed to the effect of applying an antiseptic solution to wound dressings.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Wounds will be swabbed at end of surgery and then 7 days after surgery. Number and type of bacteria present will be analysed. Our hypothesis is that applying the antiseptic solution to the tie-over dressings will show a suppressed growth of bacteria when measured 7 days after surgery.</description>
