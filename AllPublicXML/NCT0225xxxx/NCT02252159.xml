      This is a Phase IV, multicenter, non-interventional, non-randomized, prospective,
      observational study in an adult population (patients &gt;18 years old) of men and women who have
      been diagnosed with clinically overt PV and are being followed in either community or
      academic medical centers in the United States who will be enrolled over a 12-month period and
      observed for 36 months from the date the last patient is enrolled.

    <description>Healthcare resources were defined as a. Medical visits (including Office visits, ER visits, and hospitalizations), b. phlebotomy (PHL) procedures and c. prescriptions (including PV-related prescriptions, PV-related over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and prescription medications for co-morbid conditions).</description>

    <description>The MPN-SAF TSS is a validated 10-item instrument that efficiently assesses the prevalence and severity of PV symptoms in both clinical practice and trial settings.

    <description>WPAI-SHP is a validated 6-item instrument that measures the effect of overall health and specific symptoms on productivity at work and outside of it. All outcomes are presented as a proportion, with 0% representing minimal/no impairment and 100% representing maximal impairment or productivity loss.</description>
