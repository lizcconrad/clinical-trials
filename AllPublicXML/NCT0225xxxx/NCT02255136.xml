  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether individualized homeopathic medicines can produce
      any significant effect beyond placebo in treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or induced
      bronchial asthma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-blind (subject), randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      interventional clinical trial is being conducted on 100 participants (subjects 50, control
      50) suffering from allergic rhinitis and/or induced bronchial asthma since March 1, 2012 at
      Mahesh Bhattacharyya Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital, Government of West Bengal.
      This trial is aimed at exploring the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in comparison with
      placebo in reducing serum interleukin 10, 13 and immunoglobulin E measured at timeline of 1
      year of treatment and absolute eosinophil count every 4 months up to 1 year. Matching for
      independent and consequent variables will be done to test for bias. Parametric or
      non-parametric tests will be employed as per distribution of data at the end of the trial.
