  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research feasibility study to evaluate various parameters of the multistage
      low-energy pulses and their effect on atrial fibrillation.

    <measure>Safety and Efficacy of Multistage low-energy pulses to organize, suppress, or terminate atrial fibrillation as determined by changes in atrial fibrillation cycle length, and atrial electrogram morphology.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed during the acute procedure which is expected to average 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Multistage low-energy pulses are delivered to the atria of patients while in atrial fibrillation. The atrial electrograms will be recorded and used to evaluate if there was a change in the atrial fibrillation cycle length, increased organization of the arrhythmia using frequency analysis or if the pulses were able to terminate the atrial fibrillation.</description>
