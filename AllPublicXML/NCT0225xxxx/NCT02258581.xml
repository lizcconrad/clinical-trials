      This study will evaluate the long term effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment on the
      HBV serologic changes and HBV DNA levels through Week 144. This registry will enroll only
      individuals who were treated in a Gilead-sponsored trial for chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

             than 120 days prior to Baseline (Day 1), except for participants from previous
             Gilead-sponsored study number GS-US-174-0149, who will have up to one year from their
             last visit in that protocol.

          -  Must be willing and able to comply with the visit schedule and study requirements

          -  Must have documented HBV DNA &lt; 2,000 IU/mL at time of screening visit, which shall
             occur no later than 1 year post last study visit in GS-US-174-0149

          -  Must have documented hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative status anytime
             during participation in GS-US-174-0149 regardless of ongoing HBV treatment

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient participating or planning to participate in another clinical study with an
             investigational agent
