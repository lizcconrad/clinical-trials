    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the efficacy between SPIES
      assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Subjects in the experimental arm (Arm A) will
      undergo SPIES assisted TURB, whereas subjects in the control arm (Arm B) will receive
      treatment with WLI assisted TURB only. Baseline characteristics will be recorded, as well as
      short and long-term follow up.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the recurrence rates of
      cancer between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Randomization is stratified
      by tumor multiplicity (single or multiple), tumor status (primary or recurrent) and
      macroscopic findings (papillary or flat, where CIS is scored as flat lesion). Patients
      randomized into the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES and WLI assisted TURB,
      whereas the patients in the control arm (Arm B) will undergo WLI only assisted TURB. WLI is
      chosen as control, since it is considered the gold standard for detecting bladder tumors.
      Short and long term follow up will be recorded in order to evaluate the health gains for
      patients over a longer period. Perioperative (30 days) complications will be compared between
      the two treatment arms to evaluate the safety of SPIES.

          -  Has or has had no tumors in the upper urinary tract

          -  Has had no previous irradiation of the pelvis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gross haematuria at the time of TURB (i.e. heavy bladder bleeding resulting in marked
             amounts of blood in the urine which may interfere with cystoscopy)

             or within the last 30 days

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding (all women of child-bearing potential must document a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and are suggested to use the
             contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device (IUD) during the treatments and for at
             least one months thereafter)

          -  Conditions associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance

          -  Has had instillation therapy in the six months prior to the screening visit
