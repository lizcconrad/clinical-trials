  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of itacitinib
      in combination with docetaxel and to select doses for further evaluation (Part 1, safety
      run-in portion).

      Sponsor decision to not initiate part 2 of the trial and Part 2 of the study was not
      conducted.

      In Part 2, the randomized portion, the objective is to evaluate and compare the overall
      survival of subjects with previously treated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) when treated with itacitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel
      alone.

      The secondary objectives of this study (Part 2) are to evaluate and compare the efficacy of
      the 2 treatment groups with respect to progression-free survival, overall tumor response, and
      duration of response, and to evaluate and compare disease control, safety, and tolerability
      of itacitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is Stage IIIb, IV,
             or recurrent.

          2. Received only 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for Stage IIIb, IV, or recurrent
             disease not including neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. (NOTE: Exceptions may be
             allowed based on prior treatment regimens and tumor types in agreement with protocol
             requirements.)

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.

          4. Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received prior treatment with docetaxel.

          2. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with CNS metastases who
             have completed a course of therapy would be eligible for the study provided they are
             clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to study entry, defined as:

               1. No evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis or new neurological symptoms
                  attributable to CNS metastases.

               2. Subjects who are receiving concomitant corticosteroids must be on a stable or
                  decreasing dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment and
                  off all anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          3. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 3.

          4. Current or previous other malignancy within 2 years of study entry, except cured basal
             or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, prostate intraepithelial
             neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive malignancy.

          5. Significant, concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition including but not limited to,
             renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac,
             neurological, cerebral, or psychiatric disease.

          6. Unwilling to be transfused with blood components.
