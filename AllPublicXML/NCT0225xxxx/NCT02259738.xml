  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human urinary kallidinogenase can promote the establishment of collateral circulation in the
      ischemic penumbra due to the stenosis or occlusion of middle cerebral artery and then
      increase the perfusion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute ischemic stroke will be given human urinary kallidinogenase .Then we will
      estimate the cerebral collateral circulation in ischemic regions and final infarct volume,
      comparing with traditional therapy such as Shuxuening injection, which will provide new
      evidence for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Perfusion Weighted Imaging(PWI) could be a
      method to reflect the infarction center and low perfusion of tissue.
