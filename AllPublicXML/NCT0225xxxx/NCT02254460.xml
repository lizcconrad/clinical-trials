  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study supplements iron as part of multiple micro-nutrient supplementation to
      demonstrate that intake of a micronutrient fortified powder in milk helps increase the uptake
      of key micronutrients like iron due to unique nature of the given matrix, as compared to
      intake of iron alone in milk.

    <description>Iron uptake was measured using stable isotopes of 57Fe and 58Fe to label the test and control products. Fractional iron absorption levels of 57Fe and 58Fe were calculated, to give a direct measure of the iron uptake from each of the study treatments.</description>
