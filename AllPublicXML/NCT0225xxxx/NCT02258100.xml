  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date the effect of AIMS on medical interventions has not been studied. We seek to
      retrospectively evaluate paper and electronic anesthesia records among a single surgical
      population (esophageal surgery) to ascertain any differences that may exist between cohorts
      with regards to chart completion, anesthetic management and medical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia information systems (AIMS) are increasingly used to electronically capture
      physiologic and management data during anesthesia. Proponents tout an improved accuracy of
      data yet this has not been formally evaluated. Furthermore, whether AIMS is associated with
      changes in medical care is unknown. Studies with newer technologies have demonstrated
      increased medical interventions as a result of implementation. The pulmonary artery catheter
      was shown to increase medical interventions when used yet no improvement in outcomes are
      observed and some suggest a deleterious effect. 1 Several studies suggest improved patient
      care with electronic anesthesia records. 2,3 These all center around clinical decision
      support that reminds clinicians to give certain medications or ensure chart completion.
      Despite these advantages there are no studies evaluating the 'hawthorne effect' of AIMS.
      Physiologic data is now recorded at each data point using AIMS. This differs significantly
      from paper anesthesia records in which clinicians often chart physiologic trends choosing to
      omit spurious values. It is possible that a Hawthorne effect may occur in this scenario with
      increased data collection and an increased ability to scrutinize the medical record. Given
      the litigious nature of medical practice today, there is concern about the impact of AIMS on
      medicolegal liability. 4 Yet, to date the effect of AIMS on medical interventions has not
      been studied. We seek to retrospectively evaluate paper and electronic anesthesia records
      among a single surgical population (esophageal surgery) to ascertain any differences that may
      exist between cohorts with regards to chart completion, anesthetic management and medical
      care.
