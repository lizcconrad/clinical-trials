  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of MLN9708 for the prophylaxis of chronic
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).

      During the phase I portion patients undergoing both sibling and unrelated donor
      transplantation were enrolled on the same arm to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).

      It was determined that the maximum tolerated dose is 4 mg. Phase I is closed.

      During the phase II portion of the trial, patients will be enrolled into two separate and
      independent cohorts: a) Matched sibling transplants and b) Unrelated donors transplants. Both
      cohorts will be enrolled and analyzed separately.

    <textblock>
      -  For potential candidates for this trial, the recommended acute GVHD prophylaxis is a
           tacrolimus, methotrexate and atorvastatin combination. However, any acute GVHD
           prophylaxis regimen at the discretion of treating physician (not involving in-vivo or
           ex-vivo T-cell depletion, CD34+ cell selection, or post-HCT cyclophosphamide) will be
           permitted.

        -  During the phase I portion, which is now closed, for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four
           doses of MLN9708 were administered orally (to patients undergoing either matched sibling
           or unrelated donor transplantation) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +74
           post allogeneic HCT.

        -  Dose escalation started at dose level 1 and was carried out according to standard 3+3
           design. The plan was as follows: If zero of three patients experiences DLT, dose
           escalation would proceed to the next higher dose level, at which three patients will be
           enrolled. The cohort would be expanded to six patients. Dose escalation would continue
           if no greater than one of six patients experience DLT, up to a maximum dose of 4 mg.

      If zero of three patients experienced DLT at dose level 2, then it would be considered a MTD.
      If two or more patients experienced a DLT, dose escalation would halt and the dose level
      below was expanded to six patients to determine the MTD. If the dose level below already has
      six patients, enrolled, then it will be considered the MTD. If two or more patients
      experience DLT on first dose level (i.e., dose level 1), then, patients will be enrolled on
      dose level -1. No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.

      •MTD is defined at maximum dose level with fewer than two of six patients experiencing DLT.

      NOTE: It was determined that the maximum tolerated dose is 4 mg. Phase I is closed.

        -  The phase II portion will utilize the MTD for MLN9708, determined from phase I portion
           of the study. In phase II, patients will be enrolled in two independent cohorts of
           matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplants.

        -  During the phase II portion, for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four doses of MLN9708 will be
           administered orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +90 post allogeneic
           HCT.

          3. Known GI disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or
             tolerance of MLN9708 including difficulty swallowing is not permitted.

          4. Patients receiving (or status post) a cord blood or a haplo-identical allograft will
             not be eligible.

          5. Patients undergoing (or status post) a T-cell depleted allogeneic transplantation will

          7. Method of stem-cell collection from the donor will be at the discretion of the
             treating physician. Although it is anticipated that majority of patients will receive
             allograft mobilized with G-CSF alone; however donors receiving allografts mobilized
             with experimental agents (e.g. plerixafor) will remain eligible for the study.

          8. Patients experiencing disease relapse (for those in complete remission at the time of
             HCT) or progression (for those in partial remission, stable or refractory disease at

         12. Patients with grade III-IV acute GVHD (even if it is not meeting criteria for steroid
             refractory acute GVHD), that is active at the time of enrollment will be excluded.
             Patients with controlled grade I-II acute GVHD can be enrolled after discussing with
             study PI. Topical or systemic corticosteroids therapy, as per standard of care for
             such grade I-II acute GVHD patients is permitted.

         13. Patients with active chronic GVHD (although unlikely before day +100) will be
             excluded.

         14. No major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

         15. No radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7
             days will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of
             the MLN9708.

             hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Cardiac enzyme
             elevations for reasons other than document myocardial infarction is not an exclusion.

         17. No systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of MLN9708, with strong
             inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin), strong inhibitors of
             CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole,
             nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort.

         18. No serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.

         19. No participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational
             agents within 21days of the start of this trial and throughout the duration of this
             trial. However co-enrollment on trials evaluating conditioning regimens, institutional
             protocols evaluating atorvastatin for acute GVHD prophylaxis, and stem cell collection
             protocols in transplant donors will be permitted. In addition patients randomized to
             standard-of-care (non experimental) arms of available phase II/III trials will be
             eligible for this study.
