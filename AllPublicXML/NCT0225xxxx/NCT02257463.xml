  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training as a part of exercise
      training in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and if it adds to
      general exercise training program in regard to respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, exercise
      performance and quality of life.

    <description>Patients started breathing at a resistance that required generation of 30% of their PImax for one week. The load was then increased incrementally, 5-10%, to reach generation of 60% of their PImax at the end of the first month. Specific IMT was then continued at 60% of their PImax adjusted weekly to the new PImax achieved.</description>
