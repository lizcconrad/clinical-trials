  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SHIP study is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for preschool children
      with sleep problems, in which we aim to give parents the knowledge, motivation, and skills
      necessary to set goals, problem-solve, and improve their child's sleep. In collecting three
      years of follow-up data, we will be able to determine the impact of the SHIP intervention on
      childhood sleep problems, obesity, academic achievement, and emotional and behavioral
      problems, as well as parental stress and daytime tiredness. This study has the dual potential
      to expand treatment resources for young children with behavioral sleep problems and to
      increase our scientific understanding of the long-term consequences of early childhood sleep
      problems.
