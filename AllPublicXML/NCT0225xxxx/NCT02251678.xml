      Elorac, Inc. is evaluating the effect of Elimune™ capsules on biomarkers C-reactive protein
      (CRP), Tumor Necrosis Factor (αTNF), Interleuken-2 (IL-2), Interleuken-6 (IL-6),
      Interleuken-12 (IL-12) in subjects with plaque psoriasis with or without arthritis.

      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with polygenic predisposition combined with
      triggering factors such as trauma, inflammation or medication.

      Elimune™ is a uniquely formulated prescription dietary supplement for oral administration.
      Each capsule contains a proprietary blend of natural ingredients, Vitamin D3, Folic Acid,
      Nicotinamide, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, Doscosahexaenoic Acid, Quercetin, Curcumin,
      Glycyrrhizin, and Hesperetin, which share anti-inflammatory activities including the ability
      to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).

      This is an open-label study consisting of a 1 day Screening Period and a 28 day Treatment
      Period. During the Screening Period subjects will sign informed consent and eligibility will
      be determined by reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria including history of plaque
      psoriasis. Demographics, medical history, medication history, height and weight will be
      recorded. A blood sample for pre-dose biomarker analysis will be collected. Subjects will
      take two Elimune capsules twice daily from Day 1 to Day 28. On Day 7 and Day 28 subjects will
      return to the site and provide a blood sample for biomarker analysis. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study. A Physician's Evaluation of
      Plaque Severity and Physician's Evaluation of Arthritis Severity will be performed on Day 1,
      Day 7, and Day 28.
