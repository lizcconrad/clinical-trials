    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CART) holds great promise for treatment of
      tumors. In this trial, CD30 positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be
      treated by CD30-specific CART cells (CART30).

      When patients enroll on this trial, autologous CART-33 cells were generated from the
      mononuclear cells of 50 to 90 ml of the patient's peripheral blood (PB). During the term of
      cell preparation of CART30, patients will receive a conditioning regimen including
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. One day after completing conditioning regimen, the patient
      will be given infusions of CART30 cells into the vein in escalating doses over a period of 3
      to 5 consecutive days.

      Extra blood will be drawn to measure the persistence of CART30 in vivo.
