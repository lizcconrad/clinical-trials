    <textblock>
      BFPET will be evaluated as a diagnostic PET agent for assessing myocardial perfusion in
      subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to standard
      nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The safety of BFPET will be evaluated in known or
      suspected CAD subjects.

    <description>Sterile study drug will be delivered in individual dosage vials labeled and calibrated to approximately 2 mCi (74MBq) for the rest imaging and up to 8 mCi (296 MBq) for the stress imaging at the time of injection. The drug will be administered intravenously by bolus injection over 10 seconds into a peripheral vein to which access has been secured followed by saline flush.</description>
