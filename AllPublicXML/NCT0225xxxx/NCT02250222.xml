  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developing LGD-6972, a novel, orally-bioavailable
      addition to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. The mechanism of action of LGD-6972 is to reduce the excess liver glucose
      production characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus that is a major contributor to
      hyperglycemia. This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating
      doses LGD-6972 administered daily over 2 weeks in both healthy subjects and subjects with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, multiple oral dose
      study conducted in normoglycemic healthy subjects (NHS) (Part 1) and subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are treated with monotherapy metformin (a stable dose at
      randomization) along with diet and exercise (Part 2). Subjects with T2DM who are not on a
      stable dose of metformin but meet all other entry criteria may be enrolled in the study at
      the discretion of the Investigator, but must undergo a stabilization period of at least 12
      weeks before determining eligibility for the study. In Part 1, a single group of healthy
      subjects will be dosed with repeated oral doses of 15 mg of LGD-6972 or placebo once daily
      (QD) for 14 days. In Part 2, a maximum of 3 groups of subjects with T2DM will be dosed with 3
      sequential, increasing doses of LGD-6972 (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo QD for 14 days.

             medical problems that pose an increased risk during the study or that may compromise
             the integrity of the study data.

          5. Has liver transaminase levels (aspartate transaminase [AST] or alanine transaminase
             [ALT]) &gt;10% of the upper limit of normal (ULN), or has creatine kinase (CK) levels &gt;2
             × ULN at screening or admission to clinic (Day -1).

          6. Has a plasma triglyceride level &gt;400 mg/dL. If triglyceride level is between 400 mg/dL
             and 500 mg/dL.

             the investigational site and then prohibited until after the last protocol-specified
             blood sample. The use of stable hormone replacement medication by women, topical
             steroids, and stable thyroid medication is permitted.

             pressure &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg or &gt;90 mmHg at
             screening. One retest of blood pressure within 24 hours is permissible at the
             discretion of the Investigator. Therapy for hypertension (beta blockers excluded) that
             has been stable for at least one month prior to screening is permitted. At the
             Investigator's discretion, one anti-hypertensive medication (angiotensin converting
             enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, hydrochlorothiazide, or
             dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) may be initiated, or the dosage of a current
             antihypertensive medication up titrated, in a subject with blood pressure slightly
             above the eligibility criterion at screening. After at least 4 weeks of stable blood
             pressure treatment, if the subject's blood pressure has decreased to within the 140/90
             mmHg limit, the subject will be fully reassessed for eligibility.

             therapy within 12 weeks prior to screening; treatment with other diabetic medications
             (excluding metformin) within 3 weeks prior to screening.

             replacement and hypercholesterolemia (gemfibrozil, Welchol, and cholestyramine are not

             above) and low dose aspirin are permitted.
