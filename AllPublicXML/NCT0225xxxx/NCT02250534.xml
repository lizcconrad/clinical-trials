  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine extended exposure to cigarettes varying in nicotine content among
      disadvantaged women. Disadvantaged women are at increased risk for smoking, nicotine
      dependence, and using high nicotine yield cigarettes and are also at significantly increased
      risk for smoking-related adverse health consequences, including cervical cancer, thrombosis
      related to hormone-based contraception, infertility, and early menopause. Studies testing an
      innovative regulatory strategy of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to a
      non-addictive level have shown promising beneficial effects (decreased smoking rate, reduced
      toxicant exposure, and increased cessation) in the general population of smokers. However,
      these studies have uniformly excluded vulnerable populations like disadvantaged worn who may
      respond differently considering their greater vulnerability to smoking and nicotine
      dependence. Thus, little is known scientifically about how this highly vulnerable subgroup of
      smokers might respond to a nicotine reduction policy. This project is designed to address
      that substantial knowledge gap.
