  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about immune responses in intestinal (gut) tissue in people
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study will determine whether change
      in the composition of gut bacteria in HIV infected individuals is related to a high
      prevalence of chronic gut inflammation and metabolic disease. The investigators will also
      investigate immune-modulatory properties of specific bacteria that correlate with disease
      both by characterizing which functional genes are selected for in their genomes and by
      stimulating immune cells isolated from blood and gut tissue with bacterial isolates. This
      work will establish whether gain/loss of bacterial drivers/suppressors of information in the
      gut contributes to metabolic disease in HIV-infected individuals.

      This is a prospective cohort and cross-sectional case-control study. Study participation will
      last up to 2 months and 93 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be evaluated for
      lipodystrophy, asked to complete food &amp; gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires and provide
      stool samples. A subset of participants will be asked to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy
      (mucosal biopsy).

      Cohort A will consist of 93 participants:

      Cohort A1: ART (Antiretroviral therapy) -treated HIV-infected individuals with lipodystrophy
      (n=35) Cohort A2: ART-treated HIV-infected individuals without lipodystrophy (n=18) Cohort
      A3: HIV-1 infected individuals naïve to ART (n=20) Cohort A4: HIV-1 seronegative individuals
      who are at a high risk for infection (n=20)

      Cohort B will be a selected subset of subjects from Cohort A:

      Cohort B1: ART-treated HIV-infected individuals with HIV-associated dysbiosis (n=10) Cohort
      B2: ART-treated HIV-infected individuals without HIV-associated dysbiosis (n=10)
