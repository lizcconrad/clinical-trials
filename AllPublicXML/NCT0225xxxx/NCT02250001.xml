      The primary objective of this study is: To evaluate the real-world safety, specifically the
      incidence rates of hepatic toxicity, pyrexia, and resistance, of DCV/ASV dual therapy in
      Japanese patients chronically infected with HCV GT-1.

      Time Perspective: Other - For patients who are treated before the contract between
      Bristol-Myers Kabushiki Kaisha (BMKK) and the treating physician is initiated, patient data
      will be collected retrospectively after the contract is signed. Data will be collected
      prospectively for patients who initiate DCV/ASV treatment after the contract is initiated

      Patient Registry study - Yes; 48 weeks (Treatment: 24 weeks, Follow up: 24 weeks)
