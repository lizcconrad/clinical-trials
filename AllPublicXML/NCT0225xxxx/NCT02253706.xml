  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general bronchoscopy is a safe procedure with low rate of complications. Indeed,
      contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy are mostly relative rather than absolute. This is
      the case of preexisting decreased blood oxygen levels which may be present in patients
      requiring further bronchopulmonary investigation. To avoid the deleterious effects of oxygen
      drops oxygen supplementation is recommended.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of oxygen supplementation
      obtained with the use of a high flow nasal cannula compared with a low flow nasal cannula
      during flexible bronchoscopy.

      Consecutive patients referred by their treating physician for bronchoscopy will be offered to
      take part in the study. Those who wish to participate and give their consent will be randomly
      assigned into one of two treatment groups (supplemental oxygen given via low flow nasal
      cannula or via high flow nasal cannula).

      Assignment to either treatment arm will not affect in any way the intended purpose of the
      bronchoscopy. All patients will be closely monitored during the procedure and 2 hours
      following its completion. Monitoring will be conducted, using strictly non-invasive measures.
