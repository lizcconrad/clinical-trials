  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although 4.7% of adolescents suffer from symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN), only 1/5 seek
      treatment. Hesitation to seek treatment is likely related to ego-syntonicity and fear of
      disclosing symptoms to parents and clinicians. Furthermore, the physical symptoms of BN often
      go unnoticed by parents and clinicians.

      In order to eliminate the barriers that prevent adolescents from seeking treatment, this
      study will offer anonymous access to online self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
      BN. Online CBT (traditional, non-anonymous delivery) has been found to be effective and
      acceptable treatment for adolescents with BN. Furthermore, in adults, this method has been
      found to be as effective as specialized treatments, and more cost efficient.

      To remain anonymous and accessible, the self-help approach in this study will be provided in
      a non-guided, or pure format (only online sessions). Studies support that a pure self-help
      methodology is as effective as a guided version.

      Although anonymity may improve accessibility, this study design could also pose challenges in
      areas such as recruitment, treatment completion and obtaining adequate informed consent.
      Therefore, before embarking on a larger randomized control trail, we would like to propose a
      small, non-controlled feasibility study to assess potential issues in these areas.

      Primary hypotheses:

      Recruitment: Based on communication with public health nurses in the high schools we plan to
      recruit from, we hypothesize that it is feasible to recruit 1-5 adolescents over a 4-month
      period from each of the 5 schools, and 1-5 from social media outlets such as Instagram,
      Twitter, Facebook for a total of 5 participants over a 4-month period.

      Treatment completion: Based on pervious studies of self-help for adolescent bulimia, we
      hypothesize that approximately 15% of participants will not complete any sessions, and many
      will only complete about half of the sessions.

      Informed consent: Based on information from large randomized control studies in the UK, we
      hypothesize that adolescents will be capable of providing online consent, and that we will be
      able to adequately obtain consent without verbally communicating with participants.

      Secondary hypothesis:

      We hypothesize a non-guided (pure) version of online CBT-BN offered in an anonymous manner
      will decrease BN symptoms after treatment completion, and at 3-month follow-up compared to
      baseline.

    <measure>Treatment completion</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The medium number of completed online sessions will be compared to previous studies on self-help online CBT for BN in order to ensure at least comparable completion rates are achieved using our novel treatment design. Participants will be provided with a feedback form following treatment completion in order to assess treatment satisfaction and adherence.</description>

    <measure>Informed consent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The informed consent process will be evaluated based on the participants ability to effectively answer online questions aimed at determining an understanding of the consent process. Participants would need to answer all questions correctly in order to be deemed capable of consenting.</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Version (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8weeks (post-intervention), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will asses effectiveness of online self-help CBT-BN in improving BN symptoms. The EDE-Q measures 4 areas of eating disorder pathology (eating concern, weight concern, dietary restraint and shape concern).</description>
