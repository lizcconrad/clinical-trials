  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of oral
      administration of HPN-07 in single doses to approximately 32 healthy male and female subjects
      between 18 and 55 years of age.

      Subjects will receive single oral doses of the study drug. The primary endpoint of this trial
      is to establish the safety and tolerability of HPN-07 and HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC).

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of oral
      administration of HPN-07 in single doses to healthy male and female subjects between 18 and
      55 years of age.

      Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in a panel of 4 cohorts with approximately 8
      subjects per cohort. There will be approximately 3 sequential ascending dosing levels of
      HPN-07, with each cohort administered 1 dose of HPN-07 ranging from 500 mg to 1,500 mg and
      the fourth cohort administered the highest tolerated dose of HPN-07 plus 1,200 mg NAC.

      The primary endpoint of this trial is to establish the safety and tolerability of HPN-07 and
      HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of HPN-07 will enable a
      preliminary determination of the relationship between dose and the time course of the drug
      concentration in the body. Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals over the
      predicted time of HPN-07 systemic exposure.

          -  Male or female subjects, 18-55 years of age (inclusive), at the time of enrollment.

          -  Healthy as judged by a responsible physician with no clinically significant
             abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG). A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included only if the
             Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures (as defined as the research site's
             standard operating procedures).

          -  Male subjects who are surgically sterile OR agree to abstain from sexual intercourse
             with a female partner OR agree to use a condom and spermicide during sexual
             intercourse with a female partner who meets the following criteria: 1) uses another
             form of contraception, such as an intrauterine device (IUD), occlusive cap (diaphragm
             or cervical/vault cap) with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,
             subdermal implants, female condom, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring;
             and/or 2) has had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy. These criteria must be followed
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose
             of study medication. Men must also abstain from sperm donation from the time of the
             first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be practicing abstinence or are using,
             and willing to continue using, a medically acceptable form of birth control for at
             least 1 month prior to Screening (at least 3 months for hormonal contraceptives) and
             for at least 2 months after the last study drug administration. Medically acceptable
             forms of contraception include abstinence, hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch or
             vaginal ring), intrauterine device, progestin implant or injection, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or double-barrier methods (i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a
             contraceptive sponge).

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential, defined as: having undergone successful
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy and/or bilateral
             oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy, as determined by subject medical history) or
             post-menopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as being amenorrheic for at least 1 year
             without another cause and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level ~50 mlU/ml.

          -  Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and Day -1
             (admission).

          -  Minimum body weight of 50.0 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 kg/m2 and 33.0
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Non-smoker (refrained from any tobacco usage, including smokeless tobacco, nicotine
             patches, etc:, for 6 months prior to the administration of the study medication) and
             has negative findings on a breath carbon monoxide (CO) test.

          -  Willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all follow-up visits,
             and willing and able to abide by all study requirements and restrictions.

          -  Ability to understand, agree to, and sign the study informed consent form (ICF) prior
             to initiation of any protocol related procedures.

             caffeine) within the past 2 years, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and/or subjects who have ever been in a substance or
             alcohol rehabilitation program to treat their substance or alcohol dependence.

          -  History of serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to any drug; or known allergy
             to any of the test product(s), or any components in the test product(s); or history of
             hypersensitivity; or allergic reactions to any of the study preparations as described
             in the Investigator's Brochure; or severe allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to
             any food, or bee stings or previous status asthmaticus.

          -  History of renal stones or taking cardiac nitrates.

          -  Any clinically significant central nervous system (e.g., seizures), cardiac,
             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal conditions or history of
             such conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance, at screening or on Day -1, which
             would interfere with the objectives of the study.
