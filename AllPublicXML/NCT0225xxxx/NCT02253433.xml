  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the health of African-American adults who have poorly
      controlled asthma. The study will compare a home-based exposure reduction and asthma control
      intervention to enhanced in-clinic care that includes a standard clinical appointment as well
      as information from a detailed exposure history, asthma education, assessment for allergies,
      and a customized asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing. The
      interventional group receives enhanced in-clinic care, as well as a customized home-based
      environmental exposure assessment and multicomponent exposure reduction and asthma control
      intervention (five home visits over approximately 12 months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the addition of a holistic, home-based environmental exposure
      reduction and asthma control intervention to enhanced in-clinic care will result in
      statistically significant improvements in key measures of health and quality of life among
      Houston-area African-American adults with poorly controlled asthma.

      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of a
      customized, holistic, patient-centered, home-based environmental intervention for improving
      asthma control (the &quot;intervention&quot;) with enhanced clinic-based care (enhanced &quot;usual care&quot;).
      Both arms receive identical in-clinic care, including information from a detailed exposure
      history, asthma education, assessment for allergies, and a customized asthma self-management
      plan developed using motivational interviewing. The intent of the study is to
      assess-real-life effectiveness of the interventional arm in patients with complex asthma.

                  following criteria: (a) one or more emergency department (ED), urgent care visits
                  or hospitalizations for asthma in the preceding year; (b) meets the definition of
