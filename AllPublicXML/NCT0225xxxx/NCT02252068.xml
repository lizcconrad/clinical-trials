  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is highly prevalent among individuals with opioid dependence and confers greater risk
      for continued opioid use and poor treatment outcomes. However, there are currently no
      efficacious treatments available for co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety. The ultimate
      aims of this trial are the development and testing of a novel integrated cognitive behavioral
      treatment (I-CBT) for co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety disorders. This clinical
      trial consists of two phases: (1) open-trial pilot (2) randomized control trial. We
      hypothesize that I-CBT will be a feasible and acceptable treatment that will result in
      significant reductions in anxiety and opioid use.

      This Stage 1 behavioral treatment development trial involves two stages: manual development
      and pilot testing in an open trial, and a small randomized controlled trial. In both phases,
      opioid use and anxiety symptoms will be measured as the primary clinical outcome, along with
      measures of feasibility and patient satisfaction. These results will be used to further
      refine the treatment manual and to evaluate whether this treatment may enhance outcomes for
      adults with co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety disorders.
