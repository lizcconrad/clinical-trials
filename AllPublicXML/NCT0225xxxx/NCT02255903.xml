      The Study Will be a case-control study that will be conducted at Banha University Hospital
      after the approval of Institutional ethical committee. One hundred pregnant women will be
      recruited from antenatal clinic. Starting from November 2013. An informed consent will be
      obtained from the patients . The patients will be subdivided into two groups:

      Group 1(Control Group):consist of 100 pregnant females with gestational age 37-40 weeks.

      Group 2 (post date Group):consist of 100 pregnant females with gestational age 41 weeks or
      more.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Singleton, viable fetus in the vertex presentation.

        2. History of regular menstrual cycles.

        3. Gestational age calculated from the first day of last menstryal period or by
           first-trimester or second-trimester (before 20 weeks) ultrasound examination.

        4. No obstetric or medical complications of pregnancy apart from post-date pregnancy

      All patients will be subjected to:

        1. Detailed history: including, personal history, menstural history, obstetric history,
           present history and past history.

        2. Physical examination: general, abdominal and pelvic examination.

        3. Investigations: including, A- Ultrasound examintion for amniotic fluid index (AFI)
           measurement.

      B- Doppler studies:

      i - Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA -PI) and resistace index(MCA-RI).

      ii - Umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI) and resistance index (UA-RI). iii -
      Cerebro-Placental ratio (CPR).
