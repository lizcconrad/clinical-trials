  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: Sequentially determine the effects of three dose combinations of tipranavir (TPV) /
      ritonavir (RTV) (administered b.i.d.), TPV 1250 mg/RTV 100 mg vs. TPV 750 mg/RTV 100 mg vs.
      TPV 250 mg/RTV 200 mg on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, lamivudine,
      stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, nevirapine and efavirenz at approved doses. The three
      treatment groups will be enrolled sequentially starting with the highest tipranavir dosage
      group first and ending with the lowest tipranavir dosage group.

      Secondary: A) To assess the effects of zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine,
      abacavir, nevirapine, and efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir/ritonavir compared
      to historical controls.

      B) To assess the safety of three tipranavir/ritonavir combinations when used in combination
      with protocol defined antiretrovirals.
