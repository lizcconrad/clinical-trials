      The objectives are:

        1. To assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BIRT 1696 BS in rising
           single doses.

        2. To assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single dose of 100 mg BIRT
           1696 BS after grapefruit juice.

        3. To asses safety and pharmacokinetics of single dose of 400 mg BIRT 1696 BS after a 67 g
           fat and high caloric breakfast.
