  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial studies metabolomic and other molecular profiling to identify predictive
      biomarkers for radiation toxicity and survival in patients with lung or brain cancers
      receiving radiation therapy. Studying samples of blood, urine, and tissue from patients with
      lung or brain cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about
      biomarkers related to cancer and predict which patients are at higher risk for developing
      radiation side effects and how well patients will respond to radiation treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation
      therapy for lung cancer associated with the development of radiation pneumonitis.

      II. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation
      therapy for brain cancer associated with the development of radiation necrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine, blood, and tissue profiles of patients undergoing
      radiation therapy for lung and brain cancer associated with survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Collected blood, urine, and tissue samples are analyzed for biomarkers via metabolomic and
      epigenetic profiling using massspectrometry, array, and sequencing-based technology.
