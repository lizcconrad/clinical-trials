  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, little impact has been made on curing as opposed
      to controlling cancers over the last several decades. Part of the problem is that
      investigators have an incomplete understanding of how tumours behave as they evolve and in
      response to treatment. In this trial, the investigators hope to better understand the
      evolution of BRAF melanoma in response to drugs a patient may have received such as
      vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Importantly, the investigators want to understand how the tumours
      evolve resistance to these drugs and whether this can be predicted through blood tests, in
      particular of the circulating tumour DNA.

      Study population: BRAF mutant melanoma patients

      Pre-mortem bloods will be taken from the patient on three occasions at one to thirty days
      apart from each other, with the first blood draw taking place on the patient's first clinic
      visit. Six 7 ml EDTA and one 6 ml SST vacutainers of blood (a total of approx. 50 ml of
      blood) will be taken from the patient.

      When death is expected within the next 48-72 hours, the Medical Oncologist/ Radiation
      Oncologist/ Hematologist OR delegate will revisit the RAP process with the patient and/or
      family/substitute decision maker to ensure that they are still in agreement. The patient and
      the families will also be provided with an additional consent form for participation
      including blood sampling.

      -  Pre-mortem bloods taken to obtain ctDNA

        -  Post-mortem bloods and tissue To understand to what extent circulating DNA (found in
           Blood) represents the genetic content of underlying tumour metastases in BRAF mutant
           melanoma, and

        -  To correlate the appearance of metastasis-specific mutations in the ctDNA with
           histological features in the tumours such as degree of necrosis, inflammation,
           microvascular density, and location or size of primary tumour and metastases
