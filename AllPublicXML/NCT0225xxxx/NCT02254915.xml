    <textblock>
      A multi-institutional, prospective, randomised, open-label, superiority, comparative,
      active-controlled, phase 3 study. The study will compare Synergo RF-induced
      hyperthermia-chemotherapy (SHTC) plus mitomycin C (MMC) to standard treatment of bacillus
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy as first-line adjuvant treatment for intermediate and high-risk
      NMIBC, and will evaluate recurrence and progression rate over two years of follow-up.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Shortages of the active comparator drug (BCG) on the market worldwide and a growing uncertainty
    as to its future supply.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary intermediate or high-risk papillary NMIBC according to the EAU
             Guidelines and intermediate and high-risk recurrences that have not received BCG
             within the previous 2 years or chemotherapy treatment (apart from one early
             instillation) within the previous year.

          2. All clinical, intra-operative and pathological items for the EAU risk stratification
             must be documented including a bladder map.

          3. Patients must have undergone a re-resection (second TURB in accordance with the EAU
             Guidelines) (i) if the initial TURB was incomplete (ii) if there was no muscle in the
             specimen after the initial TURB (except in TaG1/LG tumours) (iii) in all T1 and all
             G3/HG tumours TURB of T1 sites must include muscle. Re-resection must be negative in
             patients diagnosed with T1 and/or G3/HG and/or multiple tumours in the initial TURB.

          4. No UC in the upper tract, kidney and ureters. This should be confirmed by CT-IVU or
             IVU performed at time of initial diagnosis in selected cases as recommended in latest
             EAU guidelines published prior to screening.

          5. No UC in the urethra, excluded by visual inspection during cystoscopy and, in
             addition, in patients with (i) tumour of trigone (ii) tumour of bladder neck (iii)
             abnormal prostatic urethra UC must be excluded by biopsy of the prostatic urethra in
             all male patients or, in female patients, from the portion of the urethra adjacent to
             the bladder neck, before study recruitment.

          6. All patients must have urine cytology dated within the screening period prior to
             randomisation.

          7. Age ≥ 18 yrs

          8. Normal kidneys and ureters.

          9. Pre-treatment haematology and biochemistry values within acceptable limits:

             (i) haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl (g/100 ml) (ii) platelets ≥ 150 x 109/L (103/mm3) (iii) WBC
             ≥ 3.0 x 109/L (103/mm3) (iv) ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (103/mm3, absolute neutrophil count)
             (v) Serum creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, Alkaline phosphatase: &lt; 1.5 x UNL (upper normal
             limit)

         10. Negative pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential

         11. A life expectancy at least of the duration of the trial.

         12. Unfit or unwilling to have a full or partial cystectomy.

         13. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          5. CIS (suspected or present).

          6. Known or suspected reduced bladder capacity. Patients will have a US estimation of
             maximum bladder capacity or void spontaneously the maximum they can retain in their
             bladder, and this will be used to determine urine volume. A minimum volume of 250 ml
             is required.

          7. Bleeding disorder

          8. Macrohaematuria of ≥ 250 RBC's/uL or equivalent (e.g. &gt; &quot;+++&quot; erythrocytes in a
             dipstick analysis).

         14. Any known allergy or adverse event that would prevent them from receiving a treatment
             that they may be randomised to within the trial.

         15. Known untreated strictural disease or bladder neck contracture or any other condition
             that may prevent catheterisation with 21F catheter. Patients may undergo dilation or
             urethral incision before entering the study.
