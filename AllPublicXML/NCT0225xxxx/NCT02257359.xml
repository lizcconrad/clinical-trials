  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epelsiban is a potent and selective oxytocin receptor antagonist in development for enhanced
      implantation rates during in-vitro fertilization (IVF). This study a non-randomized, open
      label study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of additional
      repeat doses of epelsiban in healthy females, and will be the first dosing experience of
      greater than 200 milligram (mg) as a single dose with this compound. Data from this study
      will inform the selection of doses of epelsiban to be used in future clinical studies. This
      study will be composed of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. The total duration
      that a subject involved in the study will be up to 6 weeks. At least 2 cohorts of subjects
      will be enrolled in this study and cohorts will be conducted sequentially. Additional cohorts
      will be enrolled if determined necessary. A sufficient number of subjects will be screened
      for the study to obtain approximately 6 evaluable subjects per cohort.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>
