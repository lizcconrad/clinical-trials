      This study will be done because the investigators would like to evaluate product satisfaction
      of two PINS products (product A, product B) that are to evaluate the effectiveness of
      rechargeable and non-rechargeable Deep Brain Stimulation (at baseline visit and at follow-up
      visit) and by evaluating their responses to the product satisfaction survey that will be
      given to them by a study coordinator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18 to 80 years of age.

          2. Subject has been diagnosed, by a neurologist, with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

          3. The PD patients can recharge the neurostimulator independently, with favourable
             compliance and commit to cooperate with the clinical trial study,

          4. Subjects are PINS neurostimulator users

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject were major depression with suicidal thoughts (a score of &gt;25 on the Beck Depression
        Inventory II,20 with scoresranging from 0 to 63 and higher scores indicating worse
        functioning), tumor, abnormality in routine liver and renal function, cerebral infarction,
        hydrocephalus, encephalatrophy, stroke sequela, heart disease, thrombocytopenia,
        hyperthermalgesia and any medical or psychological problem that would interfere with the
        conduction of the study protocol.Patients with symptoms of the midline at the state of off
        medication such as severe language barrier, dysphagia, disequilibrium, slipping-clutch
        gaitwere excluded. Patients who had undergone other implantation such as cardiac pacemaker,
        artificial cochlea because of the accompanied diseases such as were excluded. Patients with
        history of pallidotomy, stereotactic radiofrequency (Gamma Knife) and cell transplantation
        were also excluded.
