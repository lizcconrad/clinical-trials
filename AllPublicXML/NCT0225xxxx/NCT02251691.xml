  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to compare the drug compliance in patients after renal
      transplantation under once or twice-daily tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen.

      The rationale for this study is to access the influence of once-daily prolonged-release
      tacrolimus versus standard twice-daily tacrolimus on drug compliance in renal transplantation
      recipients base on the assumption that once-daily dosing regimen may help to improve drug
      compliance.

      This study will be a prospective, two-arm randomized and open-label, phase IV study to
      compare the drug compliance in patients under prolonged-release once-daily tacrolimus versus
      standard twice-daily tacrolimus based regimen after de novo renal transplantation.

      The investigators will evaluate the drug compliance of the patients under once or twice-daily
      tacrolimus-based regimen using the medication scale BAAIS® (basal assessment of adherence
      with immunosuppressive medication scale)
