  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant need for culturally adapted and effective health education programs to
      address rising rates of obesity and chronic disease concerns for refugee communities.
      Physical activity has been identified as an important prevention tool to prevent numerous
      chronic health conditions. This research tests the feasibility and acceptability of a
      culturally adapted physical activity intervention for sedentary adult Somali women. Study
      participants will be randomized to a 3-month physical activity program or a wait-list control
      group. The primary outcome is increases in physical activity between baseline and the end of
      the program as measured by pedometer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the physical activity program will participate in 12 weekly 1.5-hour sessions
      focused on increasing physical activity. The group sessions will include participating in
      physical activity as well as group discussions on the barriers and opportunities for
      increasing physical activity in their daily life. The 12-week program covers educational
      topics related to physical activity (e.g. overcoming barriers to activity, exercising safely,
      relapse prevention strategies) and the program gradually increases the amount of physical
      activity completed during the group sessions over the course of the 12 weeks. Over a 3-month
      wait period, individuals in the wait-list control group will be offered monthly sessions on
      health and wellness topics before being offered the physical activity program. Measurement
      visits will occur at baseline, at the end of the12-week program, and approximately 12-weeks
      after the end of the intervention. During the measurement sessions participants will complete
      assessments related to their physical activity and other health behaviors.
