      This study a nonrandomized, open-label, uncontrolled, single group assignment, safety and
      activity study in subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is
      metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not
      exist or are no longer effective.

      This study consists of Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 of this study is a &quot;3+3&quot; design to define
      the MTD of Oratecan in up to 60 evaluable subjects. It will be conducted in 2 parts; 1A will
      test the oral liquid formulation and 1B will test the oral tablet formulation of irinotecan.
      Part 2 will enroll an additional 10 subjects at the Part 1 MTD to further characterize the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of Oratecan at that dose.

      Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a potent anticancer drug under the class of camptothecins that is
      marketed under the trade name Camptosar. Irinotecan is a prodrug that is activated via
      carboxylesterase in liver and intestines to its active form, SN38 which is approximately 1000
      times more cytotoxic than irinotecan itself.

      The investigational product (IP) Oratecan is comprised of the approved drug irinotecan with
      HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate (HM30181), a novel p-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump inhibitor.
      Oratecan is intended for the treatment of irinotecan-responsive cancers. The antitumor
      activity of Oratecan is due to the action of irinotecan. Combining HM30181 with irinotecan
      allows intestinal absorption and systemic exposure of irinotecan and its active metabolite,
      SN38, at therapeutic levels after oral administration.
