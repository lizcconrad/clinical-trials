  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To propose a feasibility study of introducing a smoking cessation program in head and neck
      cancer patients with planned radiotherapy. The study will feature the feasibility, safety,
      and efficacy of a prospective smoking cessation program during head and neck irradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking during radiotherapy in head and neck cancers yields not only more radiotherapy acute
      and late complications but also poor clinical tumor response, poor local control, and poor
      overall survival. However, smoking cessation has not been included into the standard
      intervention in treating head and neck cancer patients in Taiwan. We propose a prospective
      study of introducing a smoking cessation program in head and neck cancer patients receiving
      radiotherapy. The study will feature the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a prospective
      smoking cessation program during head and neck irradiation. The primary outcome is to test
      the feasibility of the smoking cessation intervention, and the secondary outcome is to test
      the efficacy of the intervention during radiotherapy on acute and late RT toxicities, tumor
      response, patterns of relapse, and overall survival.

    <measure>Successful smoking cessation at the end of radiotherapy, confirmed by CO breath test concentrations of 3 ppm or less.</measure>

    <description>The primary outcome was to test the feasibility of introducing a smoking cessation program in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Smoking cessation status will be formally assessed by patient report and by carbon monoxide (CO) breath test. The status of tobacco abstinence will be confirmed by carbon monoxide breath test concentrations of 3 ppm or less.</description>
