      Determine the effect of twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinse on oral and lung microbiota
      biomass in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic
      bronchitis. Our primary outcome will be to compare the microbiota biomass (number of bacteria
      as measured by 16S rRNA copy number) of induced sputum and the oral cavity before and after 8
      weeks of twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinse (n=25) compared to controls (n=25) using qPCR
      and next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene comparing total bacterial
      biomass

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that 8 weeks of chlorhexidine oral rinse will decrease microbiota biomass
      compared to baseline and those on placebo. Furthermore, we hypothesize that chlorhexidine
      treatment will: i) decrease lung and oral microbiota diversity; ii) alter microbiota
      taxonomic composition in the lung and oral cavity; iii) decrease systemic inflammation as
      measured by blood high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen and leukocyte
      count; and iv) demonstrate a trend towards improvement in respiratory health status as
      measured by the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS)[1, 2] and St. George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).

      Subaim 1: Determine if chlorhexidine alters the lung and oral rinse microbiota diversity and
      taxonomic composition. Our hypothesis is that chlorhexidine oral rinse will decrease the
      diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity indices) and taxonomic composition of both
      oral and lung microbiota compared to those on placebo as determined by next-generation
      sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.

      Subaim 2: Determine the impact of chlorhexidine on systemic inflammation. Our hypothesis is
      that the decrease in lung microbiota biomass is associated with a decrease in systemic
      inflammation as measured by blood hsCRP, fibrinogen, and leukocyte count.

      Subaim 3: Determine if respiratory symptoms associate with the lung microbiota biomass. Our
      hypothesis is that chlorhexidine will demonstrate improved respiratory health status as
      measured by the BCSS and SGRQ.
