  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of
      hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE). HA has traditionally
      been used to treat knee osteoarthritis. There are a small number of studies in the literature
      that suggest that HA injections can be very effective for tendinosis. Although LE has been
      studied with literally hundreds of articles published, very little treatment has proven to be
      efficacious. This study will investigate the effectiveness of hyaluronate in treatment of
      chronic LE. This will include a two arm study with one formulation of HA tested against
      saline injections as the control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized and blinded into one of the two arms. Patients will receive 3
      injections total spaced over a 4 week period. After the injections are completed, patients
      will return for evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial injection. A total of 72
      patients will be divided into the 2 groups. The questionnaires will be administered by a
      research assistant blinded to the randomization. Three different outcomes measures will be
      collected, all patient-oriented including the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE),
      Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain while at rest and with maximum grip, and the short form
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH).

      The primary outcome measure will be the VAS for pain at 3 months from the initial injection.
      All measures will be evaluated at baseline then again at 12 months from the initial
      injection.

      HA formulation will be Intragel (IBSA) which include 2cc with a concentration of 16mg per
      2cc. The molecular weight with Intragel averaging 800-1200 kiloDaltons.

      The syringes will be coded and the injections blinded. The injections will be given 1cm
      distal to the lateral epicondyle at the site of maximum tenderness. The needle will be
      introduced to the depth of the bone then withdrawn 1-2mm. The injection will be given in two
      locations in and around the point of maximum tenderness.

    <time_frame>Baseline then 3,6 and 12 months from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15 question validated survey, specific to tennis elbow. It is composed of a pain and function measure. The best score of 0 represents no pain and maximum function.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain at rest.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline then 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>For this VAS pain score, patients will be asked to rate their pain using the following standard question: &quot;How much pain do you feel when doing an activity that involves gripping such as shaking hands, opening a jar or carrying something?&quot;. They will then score their level of pain using the VAS.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline then 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Included will be patients older than 18 years with lateral epicondylitis. The criteria
             for diagnosis will include pain and tenderness at the lateral epicondyle worse with
             resisted wrist or finger extension (with the elbow in the extended position).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded will be patients with history of prior elbow surgery, history of fracture or
             dislocation, known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or known hypersensitivity to
