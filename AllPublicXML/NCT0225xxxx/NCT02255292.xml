  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing lines of evidence support an antitumourigenic effect of cannabinoids, including
      the cannabidiol (CBD) which does not posses the psychotropic effects of
      D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These include anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and
      they are known to interfere with several mechanisms in the tumorgenesis. Yet, evidence from
      clinical trials among cancer patients is needed. The aim of the current study is to evaluate
      the impact of CBD as single treatment among cancer patients.
