      A phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult subjects at a single center. Adult
      subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment criteria will choose to participate as
      subjects who receive inactivated vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group
      1), 12 weeks (Group 2), or 24 weeks (Group 3), or to be in an observational group (Group 4)
      which will not be scheduled for a booster dose but may serve as a roll-over group for
      subjects who withdraw prior to the second vaccination but agree to remain in follow-up. A
      fifth group will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four
      weeks.

      The study will be conducted as a Phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult
      subjects at a single center. Adult subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment
      criteria will choose to participate as subjects who receive unadjuvanted or adjuvanted H7H9
      pIIV vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group 1, n=24), 12 weeks (Group 2,
      n=24), or 24 weeks (Group 3, n=24), or to be in an observational group (Group 4, n=16) which
      will not be scheduled for a booster dose but may serve as a roll-over group for subjects who
      withdraw prior to the second vaccination but agree to remain in follow-up. Within each group,
      subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either unadjuvanted
      H7N9 pIIV at 15 mcg (Subgroup A), or the same vaccine adjuvanted with the oil-in-water
      emulsion, MF59, (Subgroup B) delivered intramuscularly. Finally, a fifth group (Group 5,
      n=12) will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four weeks.
      The total duration of study participation for all subjects will be approximately 13 months.
      Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product will be suspended when one of the
      following occurs in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site: at least two
      respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to be positive for influenza or at least
      10% diagnostic tests (rapid tests, respiratory cultures or PCR assays) performed for
      influenza as positive during two consecutive weeks in the clinical or research laboratory at
      the clinical site. Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product may be resumed
      after 2 weeks without a signal that influenza is still circulating in the community, as
      defined by the same measures that indicate the start of influenza season (i.e., less than 2
      respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to positive for influenza or less than 10%
      of diagnostic tests performed or influenza with positive results).

        and be available for all study visits. -Are males or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding
        females, 18 to 47 years old, inclusive. -Are in good health, as determined medical history,
        and targeted physical examination to ensure any existing medical diagnoses or conditions
        (except those exclusionary) are stable. Note: Stable chronic medical condition - no change
        in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months (defined
        as 90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within
        acceptable limits in the last 6 months (defined as 180 days). Any change that is due to
        change of health care provider, insurance company etc., or that is done for financial
        reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of
        this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
        disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects
        may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal
        investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject
        safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and
        inhaled medications (with the exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion
        Criteria (see Section 5.2)), vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted. -Oral temperature
        is less than 100.4 degrees F -Pulse is 55 to 100 bpm, inclusive. -Systolic blood pressure
        is 90 to 140 mm Hg, inclusive. -Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 90 mm Hg, inclusive.
        -Women of childbearing potential in sexual relationships with men must use an acceptable
        method of contraception from 30 days prior to pIIV administration until 90 days after last
        study vaccination. -Note: Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or
        hysterectomy and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal).
        Includes, but is not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner,
        monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms with the use of applied
        spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods, with use of a highly
        effective method of contraception for a minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure
        and agree to practice highly effective contraception for the duration of study product
        exposure, including 3 months (defined as 90 days) after the last study vaccination. A
        highly effective method of contraception is defined as one which results in a low failure
        rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. -Female
        subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
        within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Have an acute illness within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. -Any medical disease or
        condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is a contraindication to study
        participation. -Note: Includes medical disease or condition that would place the subject at
        an unacceptable risk of injury, render them unable to meet the requirements of the
        protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or their successful completion
        of the study. -Have history of any significant acute or chronic medical conditions or need
        for chronic medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with
        immunogenicity or affect safety. -Note: Chronic medical condition - a medical condition
        persisting 3 months (defined as 90 days) or longer -Have immunosuppression or are taking
        systemic immunosuppressants as a result of an underlying illness or treatment. -Diagnosis
