      Prospective study treating patients with several retinal macular damages with acupuncture.

      To join, patients required diagnosis by a specialist, confirmed with optical coherent
      tomography of macula.

      Cases are treated with acupuncture and are followed by ophthalmologist, diagnostic, Optical
      Coherent Tomography (OCT) revised by a retinologist that is not part of the researchers team
      and by Traditional Chinese Medicine. The visual outcomes were measured each two months and
      the time of essay is two years. The final results will be compared with those reported by
      medical treatment as control groups.

      Most of the patients have ophthalmological social security service and are examined by an
      independent retinologist. We will contrast the findings with them of the study.

      Outcomes will be measured on Visual Acuity, changes of OCT and appreciation of patients of
      several parameters in connection with their symptoms.

      The efficacy and safety of acupuncture as treatment in macular diseases is analyzed under
      these parameters.
