  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primaquine (PQ) is currently the only available drug that can clear the mature transmission
      stages of P. falciparum parasites. PQ was previously shown to clear gametocytes that persist
      after artemisinin-combination therapy. A major caveat to the use of primaquine in mass
      adminsitrations for the reduction of malaria transmission is that metabolism of the drug in
      individuals with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can lead to transient
      haemolysis. The haemolytic side effect of PQ is dose-related. Haemolysis is more commonly
      observed after prolonged PQ treatment but has also been observed in African populations
      following a single dose of PQ. This haemolysis was self-limiting, largely restricted to G6PD
      deficient individuals and did not lead to clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, any drug-induced
      haemolysis is reason for concern and the World Health Organization has therefore reduced the
      recommended dose of single low dose primaquine from 0.75mg/kg to 0.25mg/kg. This dosage is
      deemed safe without prior G6PD or Hb screening. However, there is limited direct evidence on
      the extent to which this dosage of PQ prevents malaria transmission to mosquitoes.

      In the current study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of DP in combination with
      low-dose PQ to prevent onward malaria transmission. The investigators will perform the
      investigators study in individuals aged 5-15 years who are carry microscopically detectable
      densities of P. falciparum gametocytes. This age group is chosen because asexual parasite
      carriage and gametocyte carriage are common in this age group. All enrolled individuals will
      receive a full three-day course of DP, and will be randomized to receive a dose of primaquine
      or placebo with their third dose. Efficacy will be determined based on gametocyte carriage
      during follow-up, measured by molecular methods. For all individuals, the effect of treatment
      on infectivity to mosquitoes will be assessed by membrane feeding assays at two time points.
