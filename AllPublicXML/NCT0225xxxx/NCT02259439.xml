    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) represent a leading
      cause of morbidity and mortality.Patients admitted to hospital present higher mortality
      rates.The investigators lack the specific tools that allow us to easily classify and
      establish the individual prognosis for each patient during their hospitalization.

      Rational of the study:to identify the predictive factors for hospital mortality in critically
      ill patients admitted to hospital due to an episode of COPD exacerbation.

      Material and Methods:

      A) sociodemographic variables:

      Age, sex, marital status, occupation, pack\year.

      B) clinical variables:

      1- Dyspnea measured by the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and the COPD Assessment Test
      (CAT ) while stable, previous to admittance.

      3- Charlson comorbidity index and age adjusted model.

      4- The APACHE II scale: the severity of the episode upon admittance, calculated using the
      APACHE II scale, using the worst value obtained in the first 24h after being admitted to
      hospital.

      5- the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale.

      6- Lab parameters: such as glucose, albumin and heamatocrit

      7- BAP-65 score: elevated blood urea nitrogen, altered mental status, pulse &gt; 109 beats/min,
      age &gt; 65 years.

      8- Assessment of symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

      9-Glasgow scale score.

      10-CURB 65 :&quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;confused&quot;; &quot;U&quot; stands for BUN greater than19 mg/dL; &quot;R&quot; stands
      for &quot;respiration more than 30 breaths per minute&quot;&quot;B&quot; stands for blood pressure less than 90
      mm Hg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mm Hg or less; &quot;65&quot; stands â‰¥65 years.

      11-CAUDA 70: C: Confusion, Acidosis (pH &lt;7.35), Urea &gt;7mmol/L, MRC Dyspnoea score &gt;4, Albumin
      &lt;35g/L, Age &gt;70 years. One point was assigned to each variable present, giving a six point
      scoring system.

      12-The COPD and Asthma Physiology Score.

      13-The early warning score.

      14-ADO index: comprised of age, dyspnea by the MRC, and FEV1. Scores ranged from 0 (best
      status) to 5 (worst status) for age, 0-3 for MRC, and 0-2 for FEV1. Points for each component
      were added so that the ADO index ranged from 0 to 10.
