  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study to assess feasibility and patient acceptance of a text message cell phone
      application for patients with stage I-III, hormone receptor positive breast cancer who start
      adjuvant endocrine therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 75% of breast cancers express the estrogen and/or progesterone receptor
      (hormone receptors). The standard of care for women with hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer is five to ten years of adjuvant endocrine therapy with drugs such as tamoxifen or
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs). In women with stage I-III breast cancer, treatment with adjuvant
      endocrine therapy has been shown to reduce recurrences by 30-50% and improve survival.
      Unfortunately, it is estimated from large population databases that up to 35-40% of patients
      may discontinue adjuvant endocrine therapy before completing the recommended 5 years for
      various reasons, and non-adherence may reduce survival.

      The current protocol is a pilot study in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer
      who are beginning adjuvant endocrine therapy, the purpose of which is to assess the
      feasibility of a two-way text messaging application, with goals for a larger randomized
      control study to assess if the application will increase adherence and therefore improve
      disease free survival. This application includes daily text message medication reminders and
      periodic assessment of side effects and barriers to medication adherence and simultaneously
      offers assistance for treatment related issues. The investigators will collect information on
      QOL and financial burden during the 3 month period and will correlate these metrics with
      adherence. This larger randomized control study would be the first such interventional study
      to increase adherence with adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer in the US. Our larger
      randomized control trial would provide the first longitudinal prospectively collected
      information on QOL, financial burden and adherence over the entire 5-year treatment period in
      the routine clinical practice setting.
