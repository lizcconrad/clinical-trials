    <textblock>
      Phase I study in healthy adult male and female volunteers to compare the bioavailability of
      enalapril administered in orodispersible Minitablets with or without water in comparison to
      the standard galenic tablet formulation of enalapril. The standard pharmacokinetic parameters
      will be calculated from the bioanalytical results for enalapril and enalaprilat and compared
      in a descriptive statistical analysis.

      Trial design: Open label, randomized, 3-way cross-over, 3-treatments, 3-periods in 24 healthy
      male and female adult subjects.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To assess the relative bioavailability of 10 mg enalapril administered as orodispersible
           minitablets (ODMT) with water versus a standard enalapril tablet formulation (reference
           product: Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets) taken with water;

        2. To assess the relative bioavailability of 10 mg enalapril administered as orodispersible
           minitablets (ODMT) dispersed in the oral cavity versus a standard enalapril tablet
           formulation (reference product: Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets) taken with water.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To assess whether the PK of enalapril is affected when the orodispersible minitablet
           (ODMT) is entirely swallowed with water versus dispersion in the oral cavity.

        2. To assess the general safety and tolerability including local tolerability and
           palatability of enalapril administered as orodispersible minitablet (ODMT).

             medication is not relevant within the context of the trial. Paracetamol (up to 2 g per
             day) for analgesia, and hormonal birth control medication will be allowed.

         14. Use of any herbal medicines (eg. St. John's wort), vitamins, and supplements consumed
             by the subject within 7 days prior to receiving the first study treatment. However, if
             a subject has used herbal medicines (eg, St. John's wort), vitamins, and supplements
             medication within 7 days of the first study drug administration, he/she can be
             included in the study if according to the investigator the medication is not relevant
