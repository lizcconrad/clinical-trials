      This randomized clinical trial studies intracorporeal or extracorporeal urinary diversion
      during robotic assisted radical cystectomy in reducing complications in patients with bladder
      cancer. Radical cystectomy is surgery to remove the entire bladder as well as nearby tissues
      and organs. After the bladder is removed, urinary diversion (a surgical procedure to make a
      new way for urine to leave the body) is performed. It is not yet known whether intracorporeal
      (within the body) or extracorporeal (outside of the body) urinary diversion is a better
      method in patients with bladder cancer undergoing robotic assisted radical cystectomy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare perioperative outcomes and complications after robotic assisted radical
      cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (IUD) and RARC with extracorporeal
      urinary diversion (EUD) in a prospective randomized fashion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to passage of flatus. II. Analgesic requirement (narcotic use). III. Hospital length
      of stay. IV. Total operating time. V. Estimated blood loss. VI. Readmission rate. VII.
      Bladder Cancer Index Questionnaire. VIII. Ureteral strictures. IX. Stomal stenosis. X.
      Disease recurrence. XI. Secondary procedures.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo RARC with IUD.

      ARM II: Patients undergo RARC with EUD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days and then for 2-5
      years.
