      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies how well sargramostim after cryotherapy works in
      treating patients with prostate cancer. Biological therapies, such as sargramostim, use
      substances made from living organisms that may stimulate the immune system in different ways
      and stop tumor cells from growing. Cryosurgery, also known as cryotherapy, kills tumor cells
      by freezing them. Giving sargramostim after cryotherapy may work better in treating prostate
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine an unknown normal immune response (T cell and B cell) to post-cryotherapy
      treatment for prostate cancer.

      II. Detect the altered immune response (T cell and B cell) post-GM-CSF (sargramostim)
      response and post-cryotherapy for the prostate cancer.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (TREATMENT): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0 and receive sargramostim
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
