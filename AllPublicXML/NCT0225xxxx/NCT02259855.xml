      The primary objectives were:

        -  To determine the effects of steady state TPV co-administered with low dose RTV on steady
           state PegIFN and RBV in HIV negative subjects with mild hepatic impairment (scheme A)

        -  To determine the effects of steady state of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and RBV on
           steady state pharmacokinetics of TPV co-administered with low dose RTV in HIV negative
           subjects with mild hepatic impairment (scheme A)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of single dose and steady state TPV/r 500/200 mg in
           subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (scheme B)
