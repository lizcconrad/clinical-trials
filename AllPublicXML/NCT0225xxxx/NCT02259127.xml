      A new anti-HIV medicine (Dolutegravir) combined with 2 currently used anti-HIV medicines is
      non-inferior to the standard combination of medicines used in terms of efficacy and better in
      terms of toxicity.

          -  Children with co-infections who need to start ART can be enrolled into ODYSSEY
             according to local/national guidelines

          -  Parents/carers and children, where applicable, willing to adhere to a minimum of 96
             weeks' follow-up

        Recruitment will start from children aged ≥6 and&lt;18 years for whom dosing information and
        formulations are currently available. Additional formulations for younger children will
        become available during the trial and dosing information will be updated.

        ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR ODYSSEY A:

        • Planning to start first-line ART

        ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR ODYSSEY B:

          -  Planning to start second-line ART defined as switch of at least 2 ART drugs due to
             treatment failure

          -  Treated with only one previous ART regimen

          -  At least one NRTI with predicted preserved activity available for a background regimen

          -  In settings where resistance tests are routinely available, at least one new active
             NRTI from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, abacavir or zidovudine should have preserved
             activity based on cumulative results of resistance tests within 3 months

          -  In settings where resistance tests are not routinely available, children who are due
             to switch according to national guidelines should have at least one new NRTI predicted
             to be available from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, abacavir or zidovudine

          -  Viral load &gt;1000 c/ml at screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

             limit of normal and bilirubin ≥1.5x upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment or unstable liver disease (as defined by the
             presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or
             gastric varices, or persistent jaundice), known biliary abnormalities (with the
             exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones)

          -  Anticipated need for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the study

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Evidence of lack of susceptibility to integrase inhibitors or more than a 2-week
             exposure to antiretrovirals of this class

          -  Contraindications to proposed available NRTI backbone
