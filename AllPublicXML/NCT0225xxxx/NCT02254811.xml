  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delivery of FMT by upper route, including gastroscopy, nasogastric/ nasojejunal tube, and
      lower route, including retention enema, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy have all been utilized
      successfully. Endoscopic delivery requires significant health care utilization and associated
      cost. Therefore, it is extremely desirable if FMT can be infused by a non invasive modality,
      which would significantly reduce patient discomfort, procedure related risks and health care
      costs, while offering similar efficacy to colonoscopic delivery in the range of 90%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with minimum 3 episodes of Clostridium difficile within 6 months are randomized 1:1
      to received FMT by either colonoscopy or capsules. Pts are assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1
      mon, 3 mon, 6 mon and 1 year post FMT. Stool, urine and blood samples are collected. Medical
      cost for previous treatment is collected as well at pt perspective and QoL.
