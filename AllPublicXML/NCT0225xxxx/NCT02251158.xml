    <textblock>
      Study to determine the relative bioavailability of 500/200 mg of tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r)
      oral solution compared to 500/200 mg of TPV/r capsules following oral administration and to
      investigate the relative bioavailability of 500/200 mg of TPV/r oral solution with food
      versus without food.
