  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are actually no standardized quality assurance procedures included in pain treatment
      processes.

      In this observational, feasibility study the use of tablet-Personal Computer (PC) is tested
      in pain therapy centres using the validated questionnaire &quot;Activity Index&quot;. The acceptance of
      electronic data capturing is tested in patients and therapy teams (doctors and nurses).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regarding the demand for a duly documented efficacy of the therapy applied, a standardized
      procedure is imperative to show the medical and economic advantages of a given therapy. To
      obtain valid results, it is necessary to use a standardized process, monitored with a
      validated questionnaire.

      In this multi-center study the Activity Index Questionnaire will be tested regarding its
      outcome quality regarding usability and patient acceptance. Each center collects data of 10
      patients with injection pain therapy. Each patient is interviewed twice and after the 2nd
      interview each patient will fill out a feasibility questionnaire. During the whole study, the
      use and consumption of oral analgetic drugs are monitored in a diary. The statistical
      Analysis is done descriptive. Before entering the study, each patient has to give informed
      consent to participate. National Registration Guidelines for post market surveillance will be
      obtained.
