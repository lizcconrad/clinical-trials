  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful Shoulder Syndrome is a frequent complication after stroke occurring in between 5% and
      84% of patients, often having a strong impact on their well-being and resulting in delays
      achieving rehabilitative objectives.

      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping in a
      population of post-stroke hemiplegic patients suffering from painful shoulder syndrome with
      respect to pain, spasticity and range of motion.

      The study will use two groups according to the methodology of Randomized Controlled Trials.
      Both components of the two groups were treated by four rehabilitation sessions defined as
      &quot;standard&quot;. This involves joint health and passive mobility for the glenohumeral and
      scapulothoracic joints for a period of about 45 minutes each.

      The patients of the sample group underwent the application of the NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT)
      before each rehabilitative session. The control group was addressed exclusively to the
      &quot;standard&quot; treatment. The sessions were spaced apart about five days to ensure the optimum
      adhesion of NMT.

      The results were evaluated by administering rating scales for pain (VAS) and spasticity
      (Modified Ashworth Scale). The ROM was evaluated using the manual goniometer. The outcomes
      (Pain, Spasticity, ROM) were assessed at base line, before and after each treatment session
      and at 1 month follow up.

    <description>The NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT) consists of the application on the skin of an adhesive tape with a particular structure to elastic waves and with characteristics comparable to those cutaneous. Because of these characterises it allows activation of endogenous analgesic, structural and muscular support, vascular and lymphatic activation.
In this study the NMT is applied with decompressive mode on Pectoralis Major, Deltoids, Supraspinatus.</description>
