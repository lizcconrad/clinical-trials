      The purpose of this study is to gather information on how easy it is to implement the
      workshop, as well as whether individuals find this workshop helpful. In this study,
      participants will be assigned at random to one of the two study groups. Based on the
      information we obtain, we hope to develop an easily accessible support service for
      caregivers.

    <description>which will be measured by our ability to recruit our target sample and the proportion of participants who complete the CCC Workshop. Additional indices related to this aim (acceptability) will be gathered via both quantitative (entire sample) and qualitative (with a subset of participants randomized to received the CCC Workshop) methods.</description>

    <description>The Care for the Cancer Caregivers (CCC) workshop is composed of six webcasts. The Introductory Webcast is based upon Sessions 1 and 2 of Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers (MCP-C) and provides participants with an introduction to the CCC Workshop, an overview of the different meaning-centered modules (i.e., legacy, choice, creativity, and connectedness), and a discussion about identity and how caregivers' identities have or have not changed since taking on this role.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the waitlist control arm will be offered what is considered &quot;usual care&quot; at the ACS: the provision of the ACS Telephone Hotline number (1-800- 227-2345) and direction to the ACS website (www.cancer.org) where participants can find many resources for caregivers, including links to the ACS Caregiver ToolKit. They will complete assessments at time points that correspond with the completion of assessments in the CCC Workshop arm: after consent as soon as they are able (T1), about 2 months (Â± 4 weeks) after T1 (T2), and about 2-3 months after T2 (T3). Upon completion of all study assessments the waitlist control arm participants will be offered the opportunity to complete the CCC Workshop.</description>
