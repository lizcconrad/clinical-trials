  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of Stereotactic Body Radiation
      Therapy (SBRT) in localized prostate carcinoma in patients for whom the standard treatment is
      the irradiation of the entire prostate gland with or without seminal vesicles accompanied or
      not by hormonal therapy. In light of the accumulating clinical evidence favoring the use of
      hypo fractionation, SBRT regimen might constitute a much more convenient non-invasive and
      highly efficient outpatient therapy.

      Primary objective phase I:

      To irradiate the prostate gland which might albeit contain microscopic disease with
      tumoricidal doses of SBRT, and to escalate the dose of SBRT in the visible prostatic tumor
      towards the best tumoricidal dose without exceeding the normal tissue tolerance and toxicity
      in patients with organ confined T2-T3 N0 prostate carcinoma.

      Primary objective phase II:

      To determine the rate of acute toxicity grade 2 or more defined as toxicity occurring
      immediately after the first fraction of radiotherapy and up to 90 days after the start of
      radiotherapy treatment.

      Secondary objectives phase II:

        -  To determine efficacy measured by PSA failure using Phoenix definition.

        -  To determine long-term late toxicity (&gt;90 days after treatment start).

      Exploratory endpoint phase II:

      • To determine the feasibility of achieving dose constraints in the organs at risk using high
      technology radiotherapy.

Prostate tumor: starting dose 9 Gy per fraction in 5 fractions (total 45 Gy) and subsequent dose escalation up to 10 Gy.

Phase II
Additional patients will be treated at either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or at the highest dose level as determined by the investigators from the Phase I portion of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must be willing and capable to provide informed consent

          -  Histologic confirmation of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  T2-T3 tumors, N0 (clinically by no evidence of metastatic lymph nodes on CT or MRI)

          -  No direct evidence of regional or distant metastases

          -  PSA less than or equal to 50 μg/ml

          -  Visible gross tumor at the prostate endorectal coil MRI.

          -  The ultrasound or MRI based volume estimation of the patient's prostate gland no
             greater than 70g or 70cc

          -  No significant urinary obstructive symptoms; IPSS score must be ≤ 15 (alpha blockers
             allowed)

          -  Patient must have undergone an endorectal coil magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the
             prostatic gland (before rectal spacer if any),

          -  Patient must have undergone the following assessments in case of PSA ≥ 20μg/L, and/or
