      The purposes of study are to investigate the effect of therapeutic ultrasound for the
      inflammatory skin repair and whether the tissue repair under ultrasound treament is depend on
      different inflammatory level.

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic ultrasound for soft tissue repair has been used in clinical during the past
      decades. In some recent systematic review, the evidence of clinical trials were
      insufficiency. We assumed the reaserch biasin clinical trials may be due to the different
      inflammatory level of soft tissue under the similar ultrasound intensity. Our purpose of
      study is to investigate the effect of therapeutic ultrasound for the inflammatory skin repair
      and whether the tissue repair under ultrasound treament is depend on different inflammatory
      level.
