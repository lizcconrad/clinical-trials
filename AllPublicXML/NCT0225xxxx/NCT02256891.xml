  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind, randomized study evaluating the 6 month and 2 year outcomes of
      patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using one of two techniques. One
      technique used is the standard double row repairs utilizing medial and laterally based anchor
      fixation and the other technique is the standard double row repairs utilizing medial and
      laterally based anchor fixation with the use of plateley rich fibrin membrane (PRFM). It is
      hypothesized that patients undergoing the surgery with the PRFM will report a higher quality
      of life than the patients that do not receive this treatment.

    <description>The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index total score is on a scale of 0-2100; where 0 is the best score and 2100 is the score. There is a discrepancy between overall number of participants analyzed for this measure when compared to the participant flow module.

    <description>MRI was used to determine size of the defect in the proximal to distal, humeral to bursal, superior to inferior direction in all four tendons. All post operative rotator cuffs were described using the MRI rating system of Sugaya. This classification distinguishes 5 outcomes of rotator cuff repair based on integrity of the tendon determine by post operative MRI. Type I demonstrates the repaired rotator cuff has sufficient thickness and homogeneously low intensity on each image; Type II sufficient thickness with a partial high intensity area; Type III insufficient thickness without discontinuity, Type IV the presence of a minor discontinuity in more than one slice of each image suggestive of small tear; Type V the presence of a major discontinuity on each image suggestive of a large tear.
Higher grades are worse radiographic outcomes.</description>

        <description>MRI was used to determine size of the defect in the proximal to distal, humeral to bursal, superior to inferior direction in all four tendons. All post operative rotator cuffs were described using the MRI rating system of Sugaya. This classification distinguishes 5 outcomes of rotator cuff repair based on integrity of the tendon determine by post operative MRI. Type I demonstrates the repaired rotator cuff has sufficient thickness and homogeneously low intensity on each image; Type II sufficient thickness with a partial high intensity area; Type III insufficient thickness without discontinuity, Type IV the presence of a minor discontinuity in more than one slice of each image suggestive of small tear; Type V the presence of a major discontinuity on each image suggestive of a large tear.
Higher grades are worse radiographic outcomes.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A disadvantage is the majority of the tears are small or medium sized. These have a higher intrinsic healing and as such may not require platelet augmentation to afford a successful outcome.</limitations_and_caveats>
