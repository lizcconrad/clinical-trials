      Study objective To assess the performance of different application regimens of Actinica® on
      protection from UV rays-induced erythema throughout 1 day of sun exposure in fair-skinned
      healthy subjects (phototype I to III).

      Study centers A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled in 1 site in France.

      Methodology This will be a monocentre, randomised, controlled, investigator-blind,
      intra-individual comparative clinical investigation.

      There will be a total of 6 visits for each subject. Each subject will participate for a
      period of maximum 35 days.

      Study population Healthy subjects, male or female, at least 18-60 years old, with phototype
      I, II or III, not pre-treated/pre-protected skin, meeting specific inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      The clinical investigation will be conducted in 2 parts.

      Part 1 - SPF determination:

      To determine the SPF of Actinica® with application of two different amounts (0.8 and 2
      mg/cm2).

      Part 2 - Sun exposure:

      To assess the performance of the different application regimens of Actinica® on protection
      from UVR-induced erythema throughout 1 day of sun exposure.
