  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of a phase Ib clinical trial is to find the doses of drugs that are safe. Although
      BGJ398 has been given to patients safely on its own, it has never been given together with
      imatinib mesylate. In this study, we will test the safety of taking BGJ398 with imatinib
      mesylate. The investigators will learn this by closely checking for side effects that the
      patient may experience. Side effects can be seen in laboratory studies, on physical
      examination, or by asking the patient.Once a dose has been determined to be safe, a larger
      Phase II study will be done in patients with advanced GIST who have never received any prior
      treatments.

    <description>BGJ398 With Imatinib Mesylate In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily and BGJ398 at the standard 3+3 escalation doses for 21 days on, 7 days off (treatment schedule A).Using treatment schedule A, if dose level 1 to -2 is identified as the MTD and concern exists regarding therapeutic activity of BGJ398 at this dose level, expansions with higher dose levels (1 to 3) may be considered at the MSKCC PI's discretion, with modification of the treatment schedule. In this setting BGJ398 will be administered daily for one week followed by 3 weeks off and imatinib will be taken daily throughout the 4 week cycle period (treatment schedule B). In the phase II portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily (standard of care first line imatinib dose) and BGJ398 at the RP2D and treatment schedule identified in the phase Ib portion of the study. One cycle is 28 days.</description>

          -  In the Phase II portion, patients must be newly diagnosed or imatinib treatment naïve
             in the advanced/metastatic setting. Prior adjuvant imatinib therapy is allowed as long
             as disease recurrence was documented ≥90 days after last dose of imatinib and imatinib
