  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of consumption of sugar sweetened and
      diet beverages on overall fat mass and the fat mass of various tissues implicated in the
      dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In addition, hypothalamic activity will also be
      investigated after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and diet beverages, and again after 6
      months of daily consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess fat deposition in skeletal muscle and the liver have both been implicated in the
      metabolic dysregulation that leads to type II diabetes. It has been shown that daily
      consumption of sugar sweetened beverages can lead to increases in the fat mass of these
      organs. However, little appreciation was given for the effect of overall changes in weight
      and fat mass or how applicable the doses provided may be for how sugar sweetened beverages
      are typically consumed.

      In addition, it has recently been shown that sugars can suppress hypothalamic activity and
      alter patterns of brain connectivity in regions known to be involved in homeostasis and
      reward aspects of food intake. However, these observations were made after large doses or
      sugars not commonly consumed in isolation from other sugars or other macronutrients. Foods
      containing non-caloric sweeteners have also been suggested to suppress hypothalamic activity
      due to the disconnect between perceived sweetness and calories consumed.

      AIM 1: To investigate the response to six months of daily consumption of sugar sweetened or
      diet beverages as part of a weight-stable structured diet on whole body fat content, but also
      specifically fat content of the liver, skeletal muscles the abdomen.

      AIM 2: To investigate hypothalamic activity after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and or
      diet beverages, and whether chronic exposure for 6 months induces any changes in hypothalamic
      activity.
