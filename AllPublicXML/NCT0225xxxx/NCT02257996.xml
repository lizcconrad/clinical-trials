      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of online systematic brief psychodynamic
      psychotherapy (SBPP) via HIPAA compliant web conferencing on adults with neurotic disorders.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Single blind.

      Setting: Internet users in the community, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

      Participants: Thirty-two adults will be randomly allocated to a group will receive online
      systematic brief psychodynamic psychotherapy (n=16), or a waiting list group (n=16).

      Method: Systematic adaptative diagnosis system will be applied in both groups at
      pre-treatment and post-treatment (or post-waiting list). Assessment will be a comparison of
      the adaptative diagnosis evolution between groups.

      Primary Outcomes: The subjects treated with online brief systematic psychodynamic
      psychotherapy will present an increase in their adaptative efficacy measured by systematic
      adaptative diagnosis scale (SADS) in comparison to the waiting list group, when contrasting
      their initial and final adaptative diagnostics.
