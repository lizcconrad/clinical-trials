  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common cardiovascular problem which is increasing in both prevalence and
      incidence and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of heart
      failure patients is complex and has become a priority world over. Effective methods to keep
      heart failure patients out of the hospital are essential, both in the interests of the
      patient's health, as well as to reduce the burden on the health care system
    </textblock>

      Heart failure patients should be in a position to provide readings of their weight, blood
      pressure, fluid intake, thoracic fluid, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate,
      stroke volume, cardiac output, medications and other important parameters and communicate
      this data to care providers using wireless technology. This data should be made available to
      medical personnel regularly and on a periodic basis. In this manner the health care providers
      can detect and respond to warning signs or alerts before the patient's condition worsens to
      warrant a visit to the doctor or a hospital admission with features of heart failure
      decompensation. Programs for chronic heart failure that include remote monitoring have been
      shown to have a positive effect on clinical outcomes in community dwelling patients with
      chronic heart failure.

      In preparation for a study evaluating the effectiveness of mobile monitoring, the value of
      Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output need to be validated against FDA approved devices that are
      available in a hospital or clinic setting. This study covers the validation of the
      measurements taken with the proposed home monitoring device, Perminova's CoVaTM Sensor
      (Sensor) against clinic devices such as bio-impedance devices, echocardiogram, Doppler and/or
      MRI
