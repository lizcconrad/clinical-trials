    <textblock>
      Open-label, phase I, non-randomized, multicentric study of single-agent OTX105/MK-8628
      administered according to two distinct regimens to participants with selected advanced
      tumors.

      The study will be performed in two parts.

      Dose Escalation Part:

      This step is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in each of the two
      regimens, which will be evaluated in parallel. Participants will receive oral OTX105/MK-8628
      according to:

      Continuous Dosing Regimen: continuous, once daily for 21 consecutive days (21-day cycles).

      OR Days 1-7 Dosing Regimen: once daily on Days 1 to 7, repeated every 3 weeks (21-day cycles;
      1 week ON/2 weeks OFF).

      Participants will be sequentially assigned to Continuous Dosing Regimen or Days 1-7 Dosing
      Regimen according to the next available place and receive OTX105/MK-8628 at escalating doses
      levels (DL). Cohorts of 3 participants will be treated, and an additional 3 participants will
      be treated at the first indication of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD assessment will be
      based on the tolerability observed during the first 21 days of treatment.

      Expansion Part:

      The efficacy of OTX105/MK-8628 in each of the five indications (i.e., Bromodomain-Nuclear
      Protein in Testis [BRD-NUT] midline carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer [TNBC],
      non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] harboring a rearrangement Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase [ALK]
      gene/fusion protein or Kirsten Ras [KRAS] mutation, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and
      pancreatic ductal carcinoma) will be assessed in terms of response (Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 [RECIST v1.1] or Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group
      2 [PCWG2]) using a selected regimen.
