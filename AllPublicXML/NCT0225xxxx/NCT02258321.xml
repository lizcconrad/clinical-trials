          -  body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  HIV-1 antibody negative.

          -  hepatitis B (HBV) surface antigen negative.

          -  hepatitis C (HCV) antibody negative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating subjects.

          -  Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with subject treatment, assessment, or compliance with
             the protocol. This would include renal, cardiac, hematologic, hepatic, pulmonary
             (including chronic asthma), endocrine (e.g., diabetes), central or peripheral nervous,
             gastrointestinal (including an ulcer), vascular, metabolic (thyroid disorders, adrenal
             disease), or immunodeficiency disorders, active infection, or malignancy that is
             clinically significant or requiring treatment.

          -  Have participated in an investigational trial involving administration of any
             investigational compound within 30 days prior to the study dosing.

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere
             with subject compliance.

          -  Have poor venous access and unable to donate blood.

          -  Have donated blood within 56 days of study dosing.

          -  Have donated plasma within 7 days of study dosing.

          -  Have taken any prescription medications or over-the-counter medications including
             herbal products within 28 days of commencing study drug dosing with the exception of
             vitamins and/or acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen and/or contraceptive medications.
