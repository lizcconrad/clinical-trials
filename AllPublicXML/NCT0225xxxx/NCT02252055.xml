  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect evidence of the safety of administering autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells
      (ATDC) preparations to living-donor renal transplant recipients in the context of an
      international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluationg cellular immunotherapy in
      solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced
      by ATDC therapy can evntually be used to reduce the need for conventional immunosuppression
      in transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of immunosuppressive drug development have produced an array of powerful
      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks associated with these treatments leaves
      considerable room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the
      human immune system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and
      induce a level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical
      testing in an early-stage trial. The ONE Study aims to answer the question as whether ATDC
      treatment, or immunoregulatory cell-based therapy in general, has any place in the clinical
      management of solid organ transplant recipients.
