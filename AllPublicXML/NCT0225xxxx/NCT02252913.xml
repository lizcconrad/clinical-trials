    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of volitinib in
      combination with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer and
      to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      volitinib in combination with docetaxel.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, open-label study.

      There are two stages to this study: a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage.
      Approximately 40-50 patients will be enrolled in this two-stage study, about 12-18 patients
      in the dose-escalation stage and approximately 30 patients in the dose-expansion stage.

      Dose escalation stage

      Gastric cancer patients who failed the first line therapy (no matter the cMet status) who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into this stage.

      Cohort 1: Volitinib 600mg QD + docetaxel 75mg/m2 Cohort 2: Volitinib 800mg QD+ docetaxel
      75mg/m2 The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add
      additional 3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied for
      dose escalation and MTD or RP2D determination. Each treatment cycle will be composed of 3
      weeks or 21 days. Dose escalation and entry of the next cohort will occur only after
      acceptable tolerance has been demonstrated throughout the entire Cycle1.

      Dose expansion Stage

      Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD or RP2D to further refine the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and efficacy at this dose. Patients will be limited to the metastatic /
      locally advanced gastric cancer patients who failed the first therapy and with positive cMet
      test results. Patients will be divided into two treatment groups according their c-Met test
      results:

      Group A: FISH + , IHC -/+(about 15 patients) Group B: IHC+ and FISH- (about 15 patients)

    <description>Dose escalation stage: oral administration, Volitinib 600mg/800 QD + docetaxel 75mg/m2.
If the dose of docetaxel 75mg/m2 is not tolerable, docetaxel dose will be reduced to 60mg/m2 while keep volitinib at 600mg QD as the initial dose. Volitinib dose escalation will be re-started and end at the dose of 800mg QD.
Dose expansion Stage:Volitinib with docetaxel. Use the prefer dose from escalation stage</description>
