      The objectives of this project are to increase families' understanding of eczema and improve
      eczema management in the primary care setting. We have created an &quot;Eczema Care Plan&quot; similar
      to those used in the management of asthma. It gives specific instructions about medications,
      bathing and moisturizing, as well as when to seek further treatment. We will conduct a
      randomized controlled trial of the plan in Primary Care at Longwood for a 10 month period.
      Specifically, we aim to (1) decrease eczema severity (2) improve patient quality of life and
      (3) increase parental knowledge and confidence about eczema management. We also plan to track
      provider uptake and documentation of the plan and elicit feedback from parents and providers
      on the utility and feasibility of the plan.
