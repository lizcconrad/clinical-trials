  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of BILB 1941 ZW following the administration of single rising doses from 5
      mg to 300 mg. In addition the bioavailability of the 60 mg dose given fasted and after a
      high-fat breakfast was to be be investigated
