  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the drug lenalidomide in
      combination with and following mismatched related donor microtransplantation in high risk AML
      patients in first remission. This study also aims to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of lenalidomide given in this setting.

      Microtransplantation seeks to give the participant donor cells in hopes that those cells can
      attack the underlying cancer. However, since the donor cells do not replace all of the host
      cells, it can hopefully avoid many of the serious risks involved with standard transplant,
      including graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) - a complication where the donor cells attack the
      participant's normal body. Recent studies have suggested that lenalidomide can help aid donor
      cells to attack cancer when given after a stem cell transplant. This trial is trying to see
      if lenalidomide can help encourage the attack of leukemia cells by donor cells given as part
      of microtransplantation.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved lenalidomide but it has been
      approved for other uses such as in the treatment of other cancers including multiple myeloma
      and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although lenalidomide has been studied in patients with AML, it has
      not been approved by the FDA for standard use in AML. Lenalidomide is a compound made by the
      Celgene Corporation. It has properties which could demonstrate antitumor effects. The exact
      antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown.

      After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the
      research study. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar.

      The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants, not everyone who
      participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose
      given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and
      how well they have tolerated their doses. Participants will receive the following:

        -  Cytarabine

        -  Microtransplantation

        -  Lenalidomide
