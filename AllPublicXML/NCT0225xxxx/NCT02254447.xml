  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the relative bioavailability of two candidate tablet formulations
      of 16 milligram (mg) Candesartan cilexetil (GW615775) compared with the reference product
      ATACANDâ„¢ containing 16 mg Candesartan cilexetil in healthy human subjects. This is an
      open-label, randomized, single dose, three-way crossover, six sequence study enrolling 18
      healthy human subjects to ensure at least 14 subjects complete the study as planned. Each
      subject enrolled will participate in all three treatment periods and will be assigned to one
      of the six treatment sequences, in accordance with the randomization schedule. The treatment
      periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days
      between dosing occasions. A follow up visit will be conducted 14-21 days post last dosing.
