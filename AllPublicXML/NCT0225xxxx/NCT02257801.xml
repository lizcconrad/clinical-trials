  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study effects of a four months lutein supplementation (in
      form of a lutein fortified nutritional beverage) on general learning and memory performance
      as well as on acute stress-induced changes in learning and memory performance in chronically
      stressed males and females using 2 different lutein doses in comparison to a placebo.
