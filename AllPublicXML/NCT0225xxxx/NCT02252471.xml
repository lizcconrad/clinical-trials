      This pilot study will: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of delivering CHOICES-TEEN with
      master's level mental health professionals within a juvenile justice setting; 2) determine
      acceptance of CHOICES-TEEN as measured by client adherence, retention, and treatment
      satisfaction; and 3) assess client improvement at 3-month follow-up (e.g., reduction of risk
      of HIV, nicotine-exposed pregnancy, and alcohol-exposed pregnancy).

      The overall objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and promise of an adapted
      CHOICES preconception intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) in reducing the risk of HIV,
      nicotine-exposed pregnancy (NEP), and alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in adolescent females
      on intensive community probation. The current study posits that a two-session CHOICES
      intervention adapted to target multiple bundled health risks—AEP, NEP, and HIV—will be
      feasible, acceptable, and promising in reducing these risks among females on community-based
      juvenile probation. This study will: Aim 1: Modify the efficacious CHOICES preconception
      intervention to target the prevention of HIV, AEP, and NEP. The result will be a two session
      individual intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) and accompanying therapy manual based on the
      Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Motivational Interviewing. Aim 2: Conduct a one-arm
      feasibility trial with females in the juvenile justice system to assess the promise of
      CHOICES-TEEN. This pilot study will: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of delivering
      CHOICES-TEEN with master's level mental health professionals within a juvenile justice
      setting; 2) determine acceptance of CHOICES-TEEN as measured by client adherence, retention,
      and treatment satisfaction; and 3) assess client improvement at 3-month follow-up (e.g.,
      reduction of risk of HIV, NEP, and AEP). This study will inform subsequent Stage II/III
      behavioral intervention studies and contribute to a missing, fundamental element in the
      knowledge base - further understanding of the feasibility of targeting bundled health risks
      in high-risk adolescents, and the potential promise of a gender-specific intervention for
      this population.

    <description>A three session intervention with two counseling sessions with a master's level therapist and a counseling session with a physician. The counseling with the master's level therapist utilizes a motivational interviewing approach to encourage changes in alcohol use, contraceptive use, smoking and HIV risk behaviors. This part of the intervention (a) provides norms-based-but personalized-feedback; (b) encourages participating in the smoking cessation program; (c) increases motivation to change each of the target behaviors; (d) decreases temptation to engage in risk behaviors; (e) increases confidence to avoid risk behaviors; and (f) develops a personalized, tailored change plan. The physician session provides individualized contraception and HIV risk reduction counseling.</description>
