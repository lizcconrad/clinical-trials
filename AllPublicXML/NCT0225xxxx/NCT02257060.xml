  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Linear II study is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, interventional
      feasibility study with the purpose of assessing acute safety of the Multi-Electrode Linear
      Type Ablation Catheter and the performance of the product when used for the treatment of
      symptomatic CTI (cavotricuspid isthmus) dependent right atrial flutter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one symptomatic episode of typical CTI dependent right atrial flutter
             documented by 12 lead ECG, Holter monitor, transtelephonic event monitor, telemetry
             strip, or implanted device.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous typical CTI dependent right atrial flutter ablation

          -  Uncontrolled heart failure or NYHA function class IV

          -  MI within the past 2 months

          -  Any cardiac surgery (i.e. CABG) within the past 2 months

          -  Subjects that have ever undergone valvular cardiac surgical procedure (ie,
             ventriculotomy, atriotomy, and valve repair or replacement and presence of a
             prosthetic valve)

          -  Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 6 months

          -  Documented thromboembolic event (including TIA) within the past 12 months

          -  Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude enrollment in this study

          -  Active illness or active systemic infection or sepsis

          -  Unstable angina

          -  History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities

          -  Contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, heparin or warfarin)

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 months

          -  Presence of intracardiac thrombus, myxoma, interatrial baffle or patch, tumor or other
             abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation

          -  Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access

          -  Women of child bearing potential whom are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become
             pregnant during the course of the clinical investigation

          -  Currently enrolled in another device, biologics, or drug study

          -  Contraindication for use of the investigational catheter, as indicated in the
             respective Instructions For Use
