  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To compare the systemic drug exposure of 100 μg Serevent ® Diskus ® with that of 50 μg
           Serevent ® MDI with sufficient precision so that in combination with a second trial it
           can be demonstrated that the systemic drug exposure of a new formulation of salmeterol
           xinafoate is not superior to that of Serevent ® MDI

        2. To test a system of ordered null hypotheses regarding the exposure of two dose levels of
           Serevent ® Diskus ® and Serevent ® MDI

        3. To get data about the systemic drug exposure of 25 μg Serevent ® MDI and of 50 μg
           Serevent ® Diskus ®
