  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine extended exposure to cigarettes varying in nicotine content among
      opioid abusers. Prevalence of smoking among opioid-dependent adults far exceeds that of the
      general US adult population. Opioid-dependent smokers are also at elevated risk for
      smoking-related adverse health effects. Studies testing an innovative regulatory strategy of
      reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to a non-addictive level have shown promising
      beneficial effects (decreased smoking rate, reduced toxicant exposure, and increased
      cessation) in the general population of smokers. However, these studies have uniformly
      excluded vulnerable populations like opioid abusers who may respond differently considering
      their greater vulnerability to smoking and nicotine dependence. Thus, little is known
      scientifically about how this highly vulnerable subgroup of smokers might respond to a
      nicotine reduction policy. This project is designed to address that substantial knowledge
      gap.
