  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess two types of new malaria vaccines in different
      combinations. The study will enable us to assess:

        1. The ability of the vaccines to prevent malaria infection.

        2. The safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.

        3. The response of the human immune system to the vaccines.

      We will do this by giving 48 participants three sets of vaccinations over 8 weeks, then
      exposing them to malaria infection by allowing mosquitoes infected with malaria to bite under
      carefully regulated conditions. We will follow participants closely to observe if and when
      they develop malaria. If the vaccine combination provides some protection against malaria,
      participants will take longer to develop malaria than usual or will not develop malaria at
      all. We will also recruit 4 individuals to be control subjects - these participants won't
      receive any vaccinations but will be challenged with malaria.

      Vaccinated volunteers who do not develop malaria infection in the blood after being infected
      with malaria by mosquito bite the first time may be invited back to be again infected with
      malaria in a repeat challenge experiment. This would happen approximately 5-7 months after
      the first challenge. The purpose of this second challenge will be to see how long the
      protection of the investigational vaccine against malaria lasts.

    <measure>Safety of a combination immunization regimen with ChAd63/MVA ME-TRAP given concomitantly with RTS,S/AS01B against malaria sporozoite challenge.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of solicited and unsolicited adverse events will be monitored. Solicited and unsolicited AE data will be collected at each clinic visit. It will be collected from diary cards, clinical review, clinical examination (including observations) and laboratory results. This AE data will be tabulated and frequency, duration and severity of AEs compared between groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity generated in malaria naïve individuals of two different dosing regimens of RTS,S/AS01B given concomitantly with ChAd63/MVA ME-TRAP, and of RTS,S/AS01B alone at either full standard dose or with a reduced third dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To document immunogenicity measures, capturing humoral and cellular immune responses to both ChAd63/MVA ME-TRAP and RTS,S as follows: Anti-CS (RT, C-term, full-length), anti-HBs, and anti-ME-TRAP antibody titers; frequency of CS-specific, HBs-specific, and TRAP and ME specific T cells; ChAd63 neutralizing antibody titers; avidity index of anti-CS antibodies. To undertake exploratory analysis of the correlation of these measures with vaccine efficacy. To, furthermore, undertake an exploratory analysis of transcriptomic correlates of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. This may be undertaken by microarray analysis or RNA sequencing or both techniques.</description>

    <description>Long term efficacy of the Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 vaccination regimens will be assessed by re-challenging any sterilely protected individuals at 5 - 7 months after the first CHMI and comparing the number of re-challengees who develop blood stage infection, and the time between CHMI and blood stage infection, with unvaccinated controls.</description>
