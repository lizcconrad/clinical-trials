        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, females are not pregnant
             or nursing, and agree to use a double-barrier method of birth control (condoms or
             diaphragm plus spermicide) throughout the trial (alone or in addition to other methods
             of birth control such as oral contraceptives)

          6. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within one month prior to
             administration of study drug or during the trial (review with clinical monitor if
             questionable)

          7. Use of drugs within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial, which might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of
             protocol preparation (review with clinical monitor if questionable)

          8. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within one month prior to
             administration or during the trial

          9. Current smoker

         10. Alcohol (more than 60 g/day) or drug abuse (positive urine test for illicit
             prescription or non-prescription drugs or drugs of abuse).

         11. Recent blood donation (more than 100 mL within 4 weeks prior to administration or
             during the trial)

         12. Excessive physical activities (within 1 week prior to study drug administration or
             during the trial)

         13. Any laboratory value outside the normal reference range that is of clinical relevance
             at screening, according to the judgment of the investigator

         14. Inability to comply with dietary regimen required by the protocol

         15. Chronic or relevant acute infections

         16. Infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses (defined as either being hepatitis B
             surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody positive)

         17. HIV-1 infected as defined by a positive HIV ELISA test
