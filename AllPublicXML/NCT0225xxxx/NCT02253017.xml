      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the therapeutic strategies in the
      treatment of pediatric cataracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technical progress and recently described potential issues have recently challenged the
      surgical treatment of pediatric cataracts. Many questions remain unsolved: primary vs
      secondary implantation, nature of the implant used. The aim of this study is to establish a
      systematic prospective register of all cataracts operated on in a tertiary pediatric centre
      in order to help answering these questions.
