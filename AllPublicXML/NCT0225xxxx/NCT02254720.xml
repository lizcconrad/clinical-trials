        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs (BP, PR), 12 lead ECG measurement, and clinical
             laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.
             There is no evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease.

          2. Age ≥21 and ≤50 years

          3. BMI ≥18.5 and &lt;29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index)

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local legislation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate
             (PR), and ECG measurements) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          2. Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          4. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             neurological disorders

          5. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          6. Chronic or relevant acute infections

          7. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the drug or its
             excipients) as judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          8. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than
             10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to randomisation

          9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the
             knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to enrolment in the
             study or during the study

         10. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to
             randomisation

         11. Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day)

         12. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days as judged by the investigator

         13. Alcohol abuse (regularly more than 40 g alcohol per day for men)

         14. Drug abuse

         15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to randomisation or during
             the trial)

         16. Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial

         17. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

         18. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre

             The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class
             side effect profile of anticholinergic drugs:

         19. hypersensitivity to tiotropium and/or related drugs of these classes

         20. history of narrow-angle glaucoma

         21. history of prostatic hyperplasia

         22. history of bladder-neck obstruction
