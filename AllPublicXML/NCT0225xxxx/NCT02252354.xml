  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2 part study is to look at how TAK-385 is taken up, broken down and
      removed from the body when given as a radiolabelled oral solution (by mouth) or as an oral
      tablet (by mouth) followed by a radiolabelled intravenous (IV) infusion (into the arm vein).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 parts involving up to 12 healthy male participants. In Part 1, up
      to 6 participants will receive a single 80 mg dose of [14C]-TAK-385 administered as an oral
      solution. In Part 2, up to 6 participants will receive a single oral 80 mg dose of TAK-385
      administered as two 40 mg tablets and an 80 μg intravenous (into a vein) dose of
      [14C]-TAK-385 (containing not more than 37.0kBq [1000 nCi] 14C).

      This single centre study will take place in the United Kingdom.

        <description>CL/F is apparent clearance of the drug from the plasma, calculated as the drug dose divided by AUC expressed in liters/hour (L/hr). CL which was calculated by correcting the [14C]TAK-385 AUC, following the intravenous dose with the hamilton pool result to get a true CL (L/h). Plasma concentrations of TAK-385 were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). Correction of the LC-MS/MS derived concentrations were based upon the specific activity of the administered radiolabelled drug product.</description>
