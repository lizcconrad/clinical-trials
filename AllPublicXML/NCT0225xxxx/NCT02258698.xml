      BACKGROUND: Surgical injury and inflammation provoke a stereotypical stress response. Insulin
      resistance plays an intriguing role in these metabolic alterations and depends on the
      intensity of injury. Metabolic derangements resulting from peripheral insulin resistance are
      unambiguously related to adverse outcomes and higher perioperative complication rates.
      Therefore, insulin resistance offers to act as a marker for stress and is potentially
      relevant in predicting clinical outcome. Plasma-glycosylated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is an
      established indicator for blood glucose control and has a prognostic value regarding outcomes
      after major surgical interventions.

      Adipose tissue holds a key function in endocrine metabolism by releasing multiple substances,
      so-called adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines. Recent studies have linked several
      adipokines to overall insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome-related conditions as well as
      in critical illness. Irisin, a recently identified myokine acts on white adipose tissue and
      plays a role in the prevention of insulin resistance.

      AIMS OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to assess the level and the effects of
      perioperative insulin resistance on clinical outcome in cardiac surgery patients. Based on
      previous studies suggesting glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance are associated with
      severity of illness and outcome in critically ill patients,it is proposed that patients with
      marked insulin resistance suffer from worse clinical outcome. This study protocol evaluates
      the ability of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), quantitative insulin sensitivity check
      index (QUICKI), HbA1c, the adipokines Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), C-X-C motif
      chemokine 5 (CXCL5), and visfatin, and the myokine irisin to indicate perioperative insulin
      resistance and explores for correlation with adverse clinical outcomes after 30 days.

      MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: 325 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit after elective
      on-pump cardiac surgery will be consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics and routine
      blood samples will be assessed the day before surgery. Study blood samples will be drawn
      preoperatively in the induction bay of anesthesia to measure the insulin resistance indices
      HOMA and QUICKI, HbA1c, ANGPTL2, CXCL5, visfatin, and irisin. Blood glucose, irisin,
      adipokines, and routine biochemical tests will be assessed upon admission to the intensive
      care unit and on postoperative days 1 and 3. Adverse outcomes will be assessed 30 days after
      surgery. Sample size is set to ensure at least 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.

        A total of 325 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit after elective on-pump
        cardiac surgery (Table 1) will be consecutively enrolled. This study population has been
        chosen not only because of the clinically relevant stress response to cardiac surgery but
        also because of the opportunity to differentiate between the different impacts of the
        cardiovascular system and the metabolic state on insulin resistance.
