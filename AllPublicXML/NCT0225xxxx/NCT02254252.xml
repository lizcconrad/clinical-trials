  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slow coronary flow is an angiographically diagnosed phenomenon defined as delayed
      opacification of epicardial arteries in the absence of significant arterial narrowing and
      blockade. Endothelial dysfunction at the level of microarteries have been proposed as the
      main pathological mechanism in this regard. Available evidence suggest that standard
      anti-angina medications (e.g. nitroglycerin) that solely target large coronary trunks might
      not provide adequate symptomatic relief in patients with slow coronary flow phenomenon. It is
      hypothesized that anti-angina medications which exert vasodilatory effects in large coronary
      arteries as well as small dividing branches might be superior to nitroglycerin in
      amelioration of angina symptoms. The present randomized clinical trial was thus designed and
      conducted to compare the short-term efficacy of nicorandil (a dual-acting anti-angina
      medication with effects on both large and small coronary vessels) with nitroglycerin in a
      group of patients with slow coronary flow presented with frequent angina episodes.

Based on patient's description of the anginal episodes, angina severity was classified into one of CCS class I (angina only with prolonged demanding physical activity), Class II (Slight limitation, with angina only during vigorous physical activity), Class III (Symptoms with everyday living activities), or class IV (angina at rest).</description>

        <description>One month after treatment, patients were asked to describe the angina episode and based on their descriptions, the CCS class of chest pain was determined. Based on patient’s description of the anginal episodes, angina severity was classified into one of CCS class I (angina only with prolonged demanding physical activity), Class II (Slight limitation, with angina only during vigorous physical activity), Class III (Symptoms with everyday living activities), or class IV (angina at rest).</description>
