    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to deepen the evidence base for interventions that support the
      social-emotional skills that underlie children's engagement and attention to learning tasks
      by schools (learning behaviors) and their social interactions with teachers and peers (social
      behaviors). The study tested three theoretically-distinct approaches to enhancing children's
      social-emotional development, along with a comprehensive coaching and training model, on a
      large scale within the Head Start system.
