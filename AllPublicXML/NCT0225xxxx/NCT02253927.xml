  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to explore the relative bioavailability of increasing doses of BILR
      355 BS, as a sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing solid formulation (SDS), in combination with
      ritonavir 100 mg and to explore the dose-concentration proportionality of increasing doses.

      A secondary objective was to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of BILR 355
      (SDS)
