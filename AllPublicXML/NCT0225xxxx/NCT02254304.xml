        <title>Number of Subjects With Medication Adherence Based on Morisky Medication Adherence Score</title>
        <description>The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) is a valid and reliable instrument that consists of 8 items that measure medication adherence. The scores of the MMAS-8 range from 0 to 8. This self-report scale consists of 7 items answered with a yes or no and 1 item with a 5-point Likert scale. A score below 6 indicates low adherence, a score between 6 to &lt; 8 indicates medium adherence and a score of 8 indicates high adherence.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Adverse Event or Adverse Drug Reaction (AE/ADR), Serious AE/ADR, AE/ADR Leading to Death and AE/ADR Leading to Early Termination</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An ADR was any unfavourable or unintended response (adverse event) that could possibly be related to drug treatment. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. AE/ADR was planned to be reported for both the arms together.</description>
