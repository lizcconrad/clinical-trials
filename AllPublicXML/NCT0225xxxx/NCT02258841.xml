  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an interactive, online safety
      decision aid among diverse Canadian women who are experiencing intimate partner violence
      (IPV). The investigators will also explore how the online intervention works, and whether it
      has different effects for different groups of women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1 in 3 Canadian women experience IPV in their lifetimes. Over time, chronic stress of living
      in an abusive relationship has been shown to contribute to depression, anxiety and PTSD.
      Safety planning to reduce the risk of physical and emotional harm in abusive situations is
      one of the most widely recommended interventions for women in abusive relationship. However,
      fewer than 1 in 5 Canadian women access support from violence services to assist them in
      safety planning. Rural, Aboriginal, racialized, immigrant, sexual minority women and women
      who prioritize their privacy face particular barriers to accessing information and support
      for safety planning.

      We adapted an interactive, online safety decision aid (SDA) recently developed and tested in
      the U.S. (Glass and colleagues, 2010) so that it applies to diverse groups of Canadian women,
      and extends the focus on emotional safety. The tool was revised based on a pilot testing for
      content and usability with 30 women (15 women who had experienced IPV and 15 service
      providers/experts). In this study, we test the effectiveness of this new tool, called &quot;I CAN
      Plan 4 Safety&quot; in a sample of 450 women from 3 provinces (ON, BC, New Brunswick). Women will
      be randomly assigned to complete either the personalized online safety decision aid
      (intervention) or an online tool which contains general risk and safety information (usual
      care control). Both tools are located on a confidential, password protected website. After
      initial completion of the online tools, they will be asked to login to the websites 3, 6 and
      12 months later to complete standard outcome assessments. Women may access the information
      and resources in the online tools at any time for a 12 month period after they enrol in the
      study.
