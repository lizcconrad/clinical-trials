    <textblock>
      This study will be divided into 2 parts. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, single centre,
      placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) phase I study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD (Pharmacodynamic) of TD139 in up to 36 healthy male subjects. Part 2
      will be a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, multiple dose expansion
      cohort, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TD139 in up to 24 male
      subjects and female subjects of non child-bearing potential with IPF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 6 cohorts of 6 subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive
      either a single dose of TD139 or matching placebo via DPI (dry powder inhaler) in an
      ascending dose fashion.

      A single cohort of up to 24 patients will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to
      receive a single dose of TD139 or placebo via DPI once daily for 14 days in a 2:1 TD139 to
      placebo ratio. The dose of TD139 selected will be based on data from Part 1 and on
      pre-clinical efficacy and safety data.
