      This trial will measure the fatigue in breast cancer patients.

      Two groups of patients will be realised:

        -  Arm A: Physical activity during treatment

        -  Arm B: No physical activity during treatment but after

      The aim of the study is to decrease fatigue, with adequate physical activity, in primary
      breast cancer patients who receive a treatment for their pathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open monocentric study, randomized in two parallel arms with a waiting list.

      The duration of the physical activty will vary according to the duration of the treatment:
      from 2 to 6 months.

      Several questionnaries (fatigue, quality of life, ...) will be given to patients at the
      inclusion, at the end of the period of treatment and 3 to 6 months after the end of
      treatment.

      One hundred patients are necessary in this study (fifty in each arm). We expect to a
      stability of the fatigue in Arm A compared to an increase of the fatigue in arm B.
