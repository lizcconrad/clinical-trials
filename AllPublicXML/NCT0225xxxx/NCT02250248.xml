  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical success of AttraX Putty as a bone
      graft substitute for autograft in XLIF procedures.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study. Subjects will be recruited from
      patients already under the Investigator's care who are indicated for XLIF with iliac crest
      bone graft (ICBG) autograft or AttraX Putty. To minimize bias, all consecutive patients at a
      given investigational site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to
      participate in the study whereby the biologic (ICBG autograft or AttraX Putty) will be
      randomly assigned. All subjects will be followed for 24 months following surgery to quantify
      the clinical and radiographic improvements of each biologic compared to baseline and in
      comparison with each other.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent back and/or leg pain unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least 6
             months, unless surgical treatment is clinically indicated sooner

          2. Indicated for a single-level XLIF between L1 and L5 with bilateral percutaneous
             pedicle screws

          3. Objective evidence of primary diagnosis must be confirmed by appropriate imaging
             studies

          4. 18-80 years of age at the date of written informed consent

          5. Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history, and surgeon judgment

          6. Expected to survive at least 2 years beyond surgery

          7. Willing and able to return for post-treatment exams according to the follow-up called

          8. Signed and dated informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with study
             requirements

          2. Spine abnormality requiring treatment at more than one level

          3. Previous failed fusion at any spinal level

          4. Prior fusion procedure at operative level (i.e., no revision of operative level)
