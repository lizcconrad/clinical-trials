             is monitored will participate in the study

         20. Acute diarrhea, or constipation in the 14 days before the predicted first study day.
             If screening occurs &gt;14 days before first study day, this criterion is to be
             determined on first study day. Diarrhea will be defined as the passage of liquid
             faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will
             be defined as a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day

             for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or other sexually transmitted disease or
             hepatitis. This will be achieved by the use of a card (similar to that used by the
             National Blood Transfusion Service) which asks a potential subject if they have reason
             to believe that they may fall into any category included on the card. If the verbal
             answer is in the affirmative then they will be excluded from the study
