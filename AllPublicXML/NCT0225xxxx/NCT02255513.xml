    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy and safety of HLD200 (methylphenidate) in patients age
      6-12 years with ADHD. This study has a 6-week dose optimization period followed by a one week
      double blind randomization assessment.

    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood disorders
      and can continue through adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying
      focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior and hyperactivity
      (over-activity).

      This multicenter study will utilize a 6-week open label, treatment optimization phase
      followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-week randomized, parallel-group test period
      designed to assess the safety and efficacy of HLD200 treatment in pediatric subjects with
      ADHD.
