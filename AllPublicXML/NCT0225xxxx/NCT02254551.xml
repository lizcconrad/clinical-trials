  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the combination of LDE225 (sonidegib) plus
      bortezomib is safe and effective in the treatment of relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although multiple myeloma (MM) is considered fatal, survival has dramatically improved with
      the introduction of more effective treatment options. Despite these advances, all patients
      eventually relapse and MM is generally considered incurable. LDE225 (Sonidegib) is an oral,
      investigational smoothened (SMO) inhibitor that has shown anti-tumor activity in certain
      cancers. Bortezomib is a highly active drug for the treatment of MM and has produced response
      rates in relapsed and/or refractory patients. This study will investigate the tolerability
      and feasibility of combining LDE225 with bortezomib in patients with bortezomib-sensitive
      relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM.

    <description>During the safety lead-in, a standard 3+3 dose escalation design was used to establish the MTD for LDE225 in combination with bortezomib. The MTD would be determined by the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during one cycle (21 days) of therapy. If 2 of 6 patients within a dose level experienced a DLT, that dose level would be defined as exceeding MTD and no further dose escalation would occur. The previous dose level would be considered the MTD.</description>

          9. Willingness and ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

         10. Ability to understand the nature of this study and give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received any treatment for myeloma-directed treatment within 21 days. Localized
             radiation and dexamethasone must be completed within 7 days prior to study treatment

          2. Refractory to bortezomib, defined as progression on or within 60 days of last
             bortezomib dose.

          3. Received any investigational drug within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to the first dose of LDE225. For other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g.,
             chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radiation), a minimum of 14 days between termination

          6. Those who are pregnant or lactating.

          7. Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with their
             participation in the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.

          8. Patients with &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (per NCI CTCAE V4.0) within 14 days
             prior to study enrollment.

          9. Patients with a presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that
             will interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             excretion of oral therapy (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting,
             diarrhea Grade ≥2, and malabsorption syndrome).

         10. Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on
             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as
             HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot be
             discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is essential
             that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be
             used with extra caution.

         11. Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after
             initiation of study treatment. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that
             can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on
             LDE225 treatment.

         12. Receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5, drugs that are BCRP substrates, or drugs metabolized by
             CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued
             before starting treatment with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4 or CYP3A5
             inhibitors should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to starting LDE225. Strong
             CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 inducers should be discontinued at least 2 weeks weeks weeks prior to
             starting treatment with LDE225.

         13. Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium or any other warfarin-derivative anticoagulants
             are not permitted since LDE225 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 based on the in
             vitro data. In this situation therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using
             low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or similar agents.

         14. Those diagnosed with cardiac conditions currently or within last 6 months.

         15. Those experiencing angina pectoris within 3 months.

         16. Those who experienced acute myocardial infarction within 3 months.

         17. Those with inadequately controlled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure
             [SBP] &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 100 mmHg. Patients with values
             above these levels must have their blood pressure controlled with medication prior to
             starting treatment. Patients with a history of labile hypertension, or a history of
             poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen are to be excluded.

         18. Pregnant or lactating women, where pregnancy is confirmed by a positive human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test.

         19. Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and after the final dose of study treatment.

         20. Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
             taking drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and agree not
             to father a child in this period.

         21. Those with a serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious
             underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive
             protocol treatment.

         22. Those presenting with other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive
             cancer within 3 years. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local
             treatment and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with
             previously treated in situ carcinoma (i.e., non-invasive) are eligible, as are
             patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer.

         23. Those with psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do
             not permit compliance with the protocol.

Bortezomib will be administered by subcutaneous injection (SQ) at a fixed dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21 day cycle.
Expansion: Patients will receive LDE225 orally once daily for 21 days at the MTD. Bortezomib will be administered SQ at a fixed dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21 day cycle.
Maintenance Therapy: Patients who complete 16 cycles of therapy with stable disease or better will be eligible for single agent maintenance therapy of LDE225 at the MTD orally for up to 2 years or until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

The MTD would be determined by the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during one cycle (21 days) of therapy. If 2 of 6 patients within a dose level experienced a DLT, that dose level would be defined as exceeding MTD and no further dose escalation would occur.
