      A six courses regimen consisting of a 8 hour infusion (ch14.18/CHOmAb 20 mg/m²) for five
      consecutive days will be administered every 4 weeks, starting 60-180 days after previous
      haploidentical stem cell transplantation.

      Interleukin 2 will be added to cycles 4-6 at days 6,8,10 (1 x 106 IU/m²/d s.c.) Participants
      will be premedicated with an intravenous antihistamine and ranitidine within approximately 30
      minutes prior and during the infusion of the study agent Pain as an anticipated side effect
      is managed by a standard pain prophylaxis with Morphium hydrochloride Disease status will be
      evaluated after 3 and 6 courses and after 1 year

    <description>Primary endpoint is &quot;success of treatment&quot; defined as a patient receiving the full protocol treatment, still alive 180 days after treatment without progression and without unacceptable toxicity and acute GvHD &gt;= Grade III or extensive chronic GvHD.
Thus, a composite variable is used as primary endpoint: Treatment success, is defined as a patients who did not experience
unacceptable toxicities
acute GvHD &gt;= Grade III or extensive chronic GvHD
