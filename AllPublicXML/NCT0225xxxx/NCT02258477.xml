  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of ingesting 100, 50 and 10 calories of glucose as compared to a
      non-calorie placebo (0 calorie beverage) on self-control over resisting snack foods. To test
      whether there is a threshold of glucose that will result in improved ease of resistance to
      problem foods (tested by comparing three different levels of glucose).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ingestion of 100 calories of glucose during individually pre-determined times of waning
      dietary self-control will result in improved ease of resistance to problem foods when
      compared to ingestion of lower calories of glucose or placebo (0 calorie beverage)

    <measure>Responses to the Control of Eating Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Study participant will complete Eating Questionnaire at baseline and the next 4 visits. Each questionnaire item used a likert scale (with ratings from 1 - 10). All question pertain to the last 7 days. Questionnaire items #9 asked &quot;what one food makes it most difficult for you to control eating?&quot; and question #10 asked &quot; What time are you particularly vulnerable to this one food.&quot; Higher ratings are consistent with a more significant or more frequent outcome.
Note that values in the data table below are absolute scores at each week that the subject consumed the noted treatment dose. As subjects were randomized to different sequence orders to receive the study beverages, subjects consumed any given treatment dose at different weeks (depending on their randomized sequence order).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Days That a Problem Snack Food Was Consumed at the Identified Time of Waning Dietary Self-control.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Study participant will record if the problem snack was consumed each day within the 3 hour period following consumption of the study beverage.
Note that the values in the data table below reflect the percentage of days within a week that subjects within each treatment dose consumed a problem snack food at the identified time of waning dietary self-control. The data does not represent change from baseline, but rather percentage of days within a week (calculated by how many days within a week subject consumed the problem snack food at the identified time of waning dietary self-control/ 7 days in a week) and can be compared week by week to see if there is any significant difference weekly when consuming a different dose of glucose.</description>

    <measure>Number of Days That a Problem Snack Food Was Consumed at Any Time of Day in a Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Study participant will record daily the time problem snack food was consumed. Note that the values in the data table below reflect the percentage of days within a week that subjects within each treatment dose consumed a problem snack food at any time of day. The data does not represent change from baseline, but rather percentage of days within a week (calculated by how many days within a week subject consumed the problem snack food at any time of day/ 7 days in a week) and can be compared week by week to see if there is any significant difference weekly when consuming a different dose of glucose.</description>

          <description>Compare the efficacy of 0 calorie sucralose-sweetened water on the behavioral ease of resisting problem foods during time of vulnerability to the problem food.
Glucose: This is a randomized, double-blind cross-over pilot study involving 40 study subjects. We will compare the efficacy of a 100, 50, and 10 calorie glucose beverage versus an identical volume of placebo beverage (0 calorie sucralose-sweetened water) on the behavioral ease of resisting problem foods during time of vulnerability to the problem food. After baseline data collection, eligible participants will be randomized into one of the four sequence group and receive a different beverage each week.</description>

All question pertain to the last 7 days. Questionnaire items #9 asked &quot;what one food makes it most difficult for you to control eating?&quot; and question #10 asked &quot; What time are you particularly vulnerable to this one food.&quot; Higher ratings are consistent with a more significant or more frequent outcome.
Note that values in the data table below are absolute scores at each week that the subject consumed the noted treatment dose. As subjects were randomized to different sequence orders to receive the study beverages, subjects consumed any given treatment dose at different weeks (depending on their randomized sequence order).</description>

The data does not represent change from baseline, but rather percentage of days within a week (calculated by how many days within a week subject consumed the problem snack food at the identified time of waning dietary self-control/ 7 days in a week) and can be compared week by week to see if there is any significant difference weekly when consuming a different dose of glucose.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study questionnaire involved limitations as questions were subjective in terms of how subjects defined cravings and snacking behavior. Also, food diaries may not be fully accurate accounts of subjects' actual caloric intake and food consumption.</limitations_and_caveats>
