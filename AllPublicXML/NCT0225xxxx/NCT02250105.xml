      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ARI-3037MO 3g BID compared to placebo in
      reducing triglyceride (TG) levels of subjects with severe (≥500 mg/dL and &lt;2,000 mg/dL)
      hypertriglyceridemia. Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lead-in period (6-week
      washout for subjects on non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [subjects may remain on statins
      during this period], 4 weeks for patients on statins only or not receiving any type of
      lipid-lowering therapy), followed by qualifying fasting TG measurements at visits 2 and 3, at
      least 7 days apart. If the baseline TG value is &gt; 500 mg/dL and &lt; 2,000 mg/dL, the qualified
      subjects will be randomized at visit 4 and enter the double-blind, 12-week efficacy and
      safety assessment phase. End-of-study lipid levels will be assessed on visits 6 and 7 (weeks
      11 and 12 average). A final closeout and safety assessment visit will be done 14 weeks post
      randomization

        Inclusion Criteria 1. Age ≥ 18 years. 2. Subjects willing to comply with lifestyle
        intervention modifications (diet and exercise) 3. TG levels: At randomization, mean level &gt;
        500 mg/dL and &lt; 2,000 mg/dL. 4. Understands the trial requirements and the treatment
        procedures, is willing to comply with all protocol-required follow-up evaluation and
        provides written informed consent.

        5. Patients already taking statin therapy must be on a stable dose, defined as no changes
        in the dose of statin in the 3 months prior to enrollment, and must be willing and able to
        remain on that dose for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria 1. History of pancreatitis. 2. Body mass index &gt; 45 kg/m2. 3. Weight
        change ≥ 3 kg during the lead-in period. 4. Contraindication to niacin treatment (prior
        flushing is not regarded as a contraindication to niacin treatment).

        statin treatment per clinical guidelines but who are not taking statins are excluded.
        However, these patients may be included only if the subject's primary care physician
        confirms the decision not to treat according to guidelines and its reason (e.g. statin
        intolerant subjects, subject refusal, etc.), and it has been agreed upon by the subject,
        the site investigator, and the primary care physician, after discussion of the potential
        risks of non-treatment with statins..

        7. History of stroke, myocardial infarction, life-threatening arrhythmia, or coronary
