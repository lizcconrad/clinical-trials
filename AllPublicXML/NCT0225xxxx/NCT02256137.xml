  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in cancer therapies have led to increasing numbers of adult survivors of pediatric
      malignancy. Unfortunately, treatment of childhood cancer continues to require agents designed
      to destroy malignant cell lines, and normal tissue is not always spared. While early
      treatment- related organ specific toxicities are not always apparent, many childhood cancer
      survivors report symptoms that interfere with daily life, including exercise induced
      shortness of breath, fatigue and reduced capacity to participate in physical activity. These
      symptoms may be a hallmark of premature aging, or frailty. Frailty is a phenotype most
      commonly described in older adults; it indicates persons who are highly vulnerable to adverse
      health outcomes. Frailty may help explain why nearly two thirds of childhood cancer survivors
      have at least one severe chronic health condition 30 years from diagnosis, why childhood
      cancer survivors are more likely than peers to be hospitalized for non-obstetrical reasons,
      and why they have mortality rates more than eight times higher than age-and-gender matched
      members of the general population.

      Frailty is a valuable construct because it can be distinguished from disability and
      co-morbidity, and is designed to capture pre-clinical states of physiologic vulnerability
      that identify individuals most at risk for adverse health outcomes. These investigators have
      recently presented data indicating that impaired fitness is present in survivors of childhood
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia, brain tumor and Hodgkin lymphoma. This is relevant because
      frailty, characterized by a cluster of five measurements of physical fitness, is predictive
      of chronic disease onset, frequent hospitalization, and eventually mortality in both the
      elderly and in persons with chronic conditions. Using a frailty phenotype as an early
      predictor of later chronic disease onset will allow identification of childhood and
      adolescent cancer survivors at greatest risk for adverse health. An early indicator of those
      at risk for adverse health will allow researchers to test, and clinicians to provide,
      specific interventions designed to remediate functional loss, and prevent or delay onset of
      chronic health conditions. The investigators goals include characterizing physical frailty
      over a five year time span in a population of young adult survivors of childhood cancer, as
      well as assessing the association between frailty and the increase in the number and severity
      of chronic health conditions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the change in the proportion of young adult cancer survivors who are frail from
           baseline to a point five years later.

        -  Evaluate the association between frailty and worsening of chronic health conditions.

        -  Describe the association between demographic and treatment factors and risk for
           prevalent frailty.

        -  Estimate the effects of physical activity, diet and smoking on risk for prevalent
           frailty.

      Participants will complete a study questionnaire to assess social support, complete body
      composition studies, walking speed test and physical activity monitoring. In addition, any
      data collected as part of the SJLIFE protocol, including questionnaires, medical history and
      physical, height and weight measurements, physical functioning assessment results (i.e. hand
      grip strength), and neuropsychological evaluation results, may also be used as part of the
      evaluation for this study. The information collected for this study will be compared to
      information collected at a previous SJLIFE clinic visit within the previous 6 years.

    <description>The event of interest, worsening of chronic condition, will be defined as binary outcome which will take value of 1 if, compared to baseline evaluation, a survivor develops a new chronic condition (grade ≥3) or if the chronic condition worsens over the 5-year time period (i.e. goes from grades 1-2 to grade ≥3 or dies due to chronic condition); otherwise it will take a value of 0.</description>

    <measure>Association between demographic and treatment factors and lifestyle on prevalent frailty.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years (± 1 year) after baseline evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the association in a path model (all variables are measured) as lifestyle factors are likely to be mediators of the association between treatment and the frailty outcome at the five year time point. Sex, age at diagnosis, radiation exposure, specific chemotherapy agent doses, and age will be included in the initial theoretical model as exogenous variables and physical activity, diet, smoking status and frailty will be included as endogenous variables. Other variables, like medication use, baseline chronic disease, etc. will be evaluated for their contributions to the outcomes.</description>
