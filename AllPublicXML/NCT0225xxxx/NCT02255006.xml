  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some studies suggest that acupuncture improve flow mediated dilation (FMD) that represents
      endothelial function, but no study has investigated whether acupuncture protects against
      ischemia and reperfusion (IR)-induced endothelial dysfunction in humans.

      This is a prospective crossover study clinical trial. In the first crossover study, 20
      healthy nonsmoking volunteers (25 to 40 years old) will be randomly assigned to acupuncture
      or control. Endothelium-dependent, FMD of the brachial artery will be measured before and
      after IR (15 minutes of ischemia at the level of the proximal upper arm followed by 15
      minutes of reperfusion). Acupuncture will be performed from 10 minute after ischemia till the
      end time of reperfusion for 20 minutes. In the second single arm study, 16 volunteers are
      administered oral 5mg glibenclamide two hours before IR injury (n=8) or selective cox-2
      inhibitor celecoxib 200mg twice a day for 5 days to know what mechanism is responsible for
      acupuncture effect on IR injury. FMD measurements and acupuncture intervention during IR
      injury are same as above mentioned.

    <description>Endothelial function is also measured by brachial flow mediated dilation (FMD). Is the difference of endothelial function mediated by acupuncture hampered by Triphosphate-Sensitive Potassium (KATP) Channels inhibitor glibenclamide or selective cox-2 inhibitor celebrex if acupuncture could improve flow mediated dilation after ischemia reperfusion injury? It is performed for knowing which mechanisms are involved in this improvement if acupuncture could improve flow mediated dilation after ischemia reperfusion injury?</description>

    <description>Active acupuncture treatment group receive electroacupuncture (EA). For EA treatment, unilateral acupuncture meridian point Pericardium5 (PC5), Pericardium6 (PC6), Stomach36 (ST36), and Stomach37 (ST37) are chosen. Disposable, sterile needles and low frequency electrical stimulator (ES-160, ITO, Japan) are used. Each needle is inserted to the depth of 2cm with a 90 degree angle. Thereafter, needles are connected with the pole and electrical stimulation is applied with 2 Hertz continuous wave current. After FMD measurement, a pneumatic cuff placed above the upper arms is inflated to 200 mmHg for 15 minutes. The cuff is then deflated, and 15 minutes of reperfusion is allowed before FMD measurement again. Acupuncture is performed from after ten minutes of ischemia till end time of reperfusion</description>

    <description>8 healthy volunteers are administered 5 mg of glibenclamide (Euglucon, Roche Pharma) 3 hour before FMD measurement. This dosage has previously been shown to be able to completely inhibit forearm KATP channels. With the glibenclamide administration, a 10% dextrose infusion is started and titrated to maintain blood sugar levels between 80 and 120 mg/dL throughout the study period. 3 hours after glibenclamide administration, the subjects undergo FMD measurement before and after ischemia reperfusion injury. During ischemia reperfusion period, active acupuncture treatment is performed for 20 minutes like above method.</description>

During ischemia reperfusion period, active acupuncture treatment is performed for 20 minutes like above method</description>
