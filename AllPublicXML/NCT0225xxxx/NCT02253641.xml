      This study evaluates the efficacy of a stress-focused tailored weight loss intervention
      compared to a standard weight loss intervention on weight loss in severely obese (BMI &gt; 40.0)
      African American women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress has been identified as a major barrier to engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors
      (e.g. diet and exercise) among African American women. African American women consistently
      lose less weight than their Caucasian counterparts in weight loss interventions. One reason
      for this disparity may be due to the failure of most weight loss interventions to address
      stress management adequately or in a culturally competent way.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a stress-focused tailored weight
      loss intervention compared to a standard weight loss intervention on weight loss in severely
      obese (BMI &gt; 40.0) African American women. The stress-focused weight loss intervention will
      incorporate stress management content throughout the entire intervention and will include
      content that is culturally tailored. The standard weight loss intervention will cover stress
      management techniques during one of the 14 sessions and the material will be more generic in
      nature (e.g. not culturally tailored).

    <description>Participants will take part in a 14 session weight loss/healthy lifestyle intervention. Sessions will be 2 hours in length and will occur weekly for month 1 then bi-weekly for months 2 - 6. The core lifestyle curriculum content for both groups will come from the previously IRB-approved Weight Wise intervention developed by Samuel-Hodge et al. (Samuel-Hodge, Carmen D., et al. &quot;Randomized Trial of a Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention for Low?income Women: The Weight Wise Program.&quot; Obesity 17.10 (2009): 1891-1899). The only modifications to the content (other than some general formatting) will be the combining of sessions 3 and 4 and sessions 6 and 7. These changes will allow us to fit the original 16-session curriculum into the 14-session format of our intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will take part in a 14 session weight loss/healthy lifestyle intervention. Sessions will be 2 hours in length and will occur weekly for month 1 then bi-weekly for months 2 - 6. The core lifestyle curriculum content for both groups will come from the previously IRB-approved Weight Wise intervention developed by Samuel-Hodge et al.. The participants in this arm will receive all of the content that the comparison group receives (just moderately condensed to allow time for additional components) plus a stress-reduction intervention woven into each of the sessions. The stress-reduction content aims to reduce stress by helping participants: (1) identifying and reducing exposure (to the degree possible) of current stressors, (2) change their perceptions of current stressors and (3) use healthier stress-coping techniques (e.g. yoga, meditation, etc.)</description>
