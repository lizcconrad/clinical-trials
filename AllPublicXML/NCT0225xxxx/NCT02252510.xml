  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is proposed to measure sperm DNA damage by sperm chromatin dispersion test. This
      measurement helps to better diagnose male infertility and seems easy to apply in routine.
      However, the reliability of this method needs to be evaluated before applying for clinical
      practice in andrology laboratory.

      The aim of this study is to measure the inter and intra-observer reliability for the
      measurements of sperm DNA damage by sperm chromatin dispersion test (halosperm). The gold
      standard to measure sperm DNA damage is TUNEL (Terminal desoxynucleotidyl end labelling)
      method. However, this method is not easy to apply in routine. Therefore we investigate to
      analyse the inter-method reliability between sperm chromatin dispersion test and TUNEL.
