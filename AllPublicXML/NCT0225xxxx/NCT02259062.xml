  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the biggest cause of disability in older adults. Early poststroke rehabilitation
      focuses primarily on physical disability and activities of daily living. By contrast,
      relatively little research attention has been paid to the potential for cognitive
      rehabilitation and mood enhancing interventions in the early stages after stroke. Low mood
      and cognitive difficulties with attention and memory are common post stroke leading to poorer
      recovery, emotional wellbeing and quality of life yet accessible and effective therapies are
      lacking.

      Engagement in leisure activities may enhance recovery after stroke but participation in
      leisure activities is reduced following stroke. Music listening is a low cost and accessible
      leisure activity that has been suggested to improve mood and cognition poststroke. The
      investigators speculate that music listening may enhance control of attention in a similar
      way to mindfulness interventions, that have been demonstrated to be beneficial in the
      treatment of mood disorders. The investigators propose that adding a brief mindfulness
      intervention to music listening might enhance the effect on control of attention, with
      positive effects on cognition and mood poststroke but the feasibility and acceptability of
      this intervention needs to be evaluated before attempting a further trial assessing the
      effectiveness of this intervention. The investigators aim to recruit 100 patients within two
      weeks poststroke.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive an 8 week music listening alone, music
      listening with brief mindfulness or audiobook listening intervention alongside treatment as
      usual. Neuropsychological assessment of cognition and mood will be performed at baseline, 3
      months, and 6 months poststroke In addition, participants will be interviewed about their
      experience of engaging in the interventions.
