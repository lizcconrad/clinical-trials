    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of adding on an environmental home intervention to standard
      asthma medication management on controller medication requirements among children and
      adolescents with asthma. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of an
      individually-tailored, multi-faceted Environmental Control Strategy (ECS) to guidelines-based
      controller medication will result in less controller medication requirement and allergic
      inflammation than controller medication alone among urban asthmatic children.

    <textblock>
      The study is a parallel arm study of an individually tailored, multi-faceted ECS plus
      controller medication titration versus controller medication titration alone. After a 4-week
      run-in period to stabilize their asthma, the investigators will randomize 200 Baltimore
      children with persistent asthma and a recent exacerbation in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms and
      follow them for six months. There will be five clinic visits and three home visits over this
      time period for clinical and home assessments, respectively. There will be up to four
      environmental intervention visits for participants randomized to the environmental control
      plus controller medication group. The environmental modules include mouse, cockroach, furry
      pets, dustmites, and smoking. Air purifiers and laundered bedding are also included in this
      arm. Participants randomized to the controller medication group have the option of having one
      home visit after completing the study at which the participants will receive home
      intervention services that the environmental control plus controller medication group
      received. Participants will have repeated assessment of: controller medication requirements;
      secondary clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory outcomes; and particulate matter (PM), air
      nicotine, and allergen levels.
