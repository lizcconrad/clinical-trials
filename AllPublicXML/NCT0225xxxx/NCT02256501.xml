    <textblock>
      According to the high morbidity and mortality of idiopathic Dilated CardioMyopathy (IDCM) in
      pediatric, new modality of treatment is emerging. There are some case reports of
      administration of stem cell therapy. The investigators design the first randomized clinical
      trial in this setting. The investigators enroll 32 pediatric IDCM patients in two groups (16
      pts. in each group including cell therapy and control). The investigators assess the safety
      and efficacy of intracoronary transplantation of autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear
      cells in this patients compared to control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy as the most common form of cardiomyopathy is a rare but
      life-threatening disorder in children. The primary cause of nearly 37 % of children with DCM
      was unknown at diagnosis. Despite of the developing in the medical and surgical treatment
      during the past several decades, standard treatments (including Digitalis, diuretics,
      inhibitors of ACE, beta blockers, antiplatelet drugs and treatments Antiarrhythmic), may
      stabilize the condition, but will not restore heart function to its previous condition.
      Therapy remains complex and expensive. For some not all children the heart transplantation is
      only option and mortality continues to be high, also. Stem cell and cell-based therapies
      offer an innovative approach to reverse cardiac structure and function towards normal,
      possibly reducing the need for aggressive therapies and cardiac transplantation. According to
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria of trial, 32 patients with left ventricular ejection
      fraction less than 45% who resistance to the standard medical therapy were randomly allocated
      in 2 groups including BM-derived mononuclear (n=16) and control (n=16). Only the MNC group
      underwent the bone marrow aspiration and intracoronary injection. The investigators followed
      all of patients at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after transplantation for cell therapy group
      or registration for placebo by physical examination, laboratory tests and imaging such as
      echocardiography, CXR and CMR.
