      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib isethionate in
      treating younger patients with central nervous system tumors that have grown, come back, or
      not responded to treatment. Palbociclib isethionate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/phase II recommended dose and describe
      toxicities related to PD-0332991 (palbociclib isethionate) in children with retinoblastoma
      protein 1 (Rb1) positive recurrent, progressive or refractory primary central nervous system
      (CNS) tumors.

      II. To determine plasma pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in children with Rb1positive
      recurrent, progressive or refractory primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record preliminary evidence of efficacy of PD-0332991 in children with recurrent CNS
      tumors.

      II. To evaluate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, cyclin D1-3, cyclin-dependent kinase
      inhibitor 2A (Ink4a-ARF) copy-number variations in available tumor tissue by array
      comparative, genomic hybridization (aCGH).

      III. To explore the potential relationships between the pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 and
      pharmacodynamic response (e.g. percentage change in absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelet
      counts).

      IV. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in PD-0332991 metabolizing enzymes and
      transporters and relate these polymorphisms to PD-0332991 pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive palbociclib isethionate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
