  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data from a well-controlled
      prospective clinical trial collecting longitudinal specimens from subjects diagnosed with any
      stage of pancreatic cancer.

      The study objectives are described below:

        1. Obtain serum and plasma specimens longitudinally collected from approximately 140
           subjects diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and are about to or are currently undergoing
           treatment and follow-up. Specimens will be used to evaluate CA 19-9 assays, currently
           under development, as an aid for monitoring recurrence or progressive disease.

        2. To store any remaining specimens for use in future cancer research and to evaluate as
           yet undetermined biomarkers for the development of IVDs, including additional CA 19-9
           assays, for monitoring the course of disease and therapy in subjects diagnosed with
           pancreatic cancer.
