  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if FMT can reverse Hepatic Encephlopathy (HE) in
      cirrhotic patients who continue to have breakthrough episodes of HE despite maintenance
      therapy with lactulose and/or rifaximin or metronidazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects receive FMT from a single donor by colonoscopy at Week 0 and by enema at Weeks 1-4.
      HE is measured by Inhibitory Control Test and Stroop as well as serum ammonia levels.
