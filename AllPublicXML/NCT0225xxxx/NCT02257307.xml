      Evaluating retinopathy of prematurity (eROP) ancillary study Implementation Project is a
      multi-center observational study will focus on feasibility, and relative cost-effectiveness
      of an retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) telemedicine evaluation system to detect eyes of
      at-risk babies and provide timely feedback to the examining ophthalmologist at the Clinical
      Center.

      Study Design: Observational Cohort Study Setting/Participants: Premature babies who are at
      high risk for ROP during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

        -  The number of sites - 5 centers in the US

        -  The number and description of participants: 500 babies with birth weights of &lt;1251g

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Data from RetCam digital images obtained as part of clinical care during the routine
      diagnostic eye exam for ROP will be uploaded and transmitted via secure server to a central
      reading center. These de-identified images will be graded by Certified Image Readers. Results
      of image gradings will be sent back via secure web-based platform to the Clinical Center. The
      primary outcome measure is the turnaround time from uploading the images to feedback to the
      Clinical Center. The secondary outcome measure is the time required to obtain retinal images
      for babies scheduled for ROP examination in the NICU (relative cost-effectiveness).

        Premature babies (N=500) with birth weights of &lt;1251g who meet current ROP screening
        guidelines in 5 NICUs in US.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Babies with birth weights of &lt;1251g

          2. Babies having clinical examinations to screen for ROP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Referral from an outside hospital for treatment of serious ROP that is performed
             before imaging can be obtained.

          -  Congenital Non-ocular Anomalies: Babies will be excluded from this study if they have
             a severe congenital non-ocular anomaly. Such exclusions include anencephaly, trisomy
             13, trisomy 18, or severe cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities. The neonatologist caring
             for the baby will determine whether a particular congenital abnormality would exclude
             the baby from participation in this study.

          -  Ocular Abnormalities: Babies will be excluded from this study if they have major
             congenital abnormalities in one or both eyes including microphthalmos, anophthalmos,
             anterior segment dysgenesis, dense corneal opacity, cataract, glaucoma,
             chorioretinitis, optic nerve hypoplasia, and chorioretinal coloboma. Eyelid
             abnormalities, such as severe blepharoptosis or severe hemangioma, that would likely
             affect vision, would also exclude a baby from participation. Minor abnormalities that
             would not be expected to affect vision may not be exclusion criteria including
             Mittendorf dot, mild blepharoptosis, limbal dermoid, and iris coloboma.
