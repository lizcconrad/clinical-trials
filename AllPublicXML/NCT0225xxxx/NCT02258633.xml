      The study will use a randomized controlled design testing the effectiveness of the following
      intervention: (i) intervener brief intervention (IBI) vs. (ii) Enhanced usual care (EUC). The
      study will identify children ages 2-14 at a pediatric trauma center. Children and their
      parents who agree to participate in the study will then complete a screening survey to
      identify part time seatbelt use. Those who screen positive will complete a more detailed
      baseline survey and then be randomized to one of two study conditions. At one month, a follow
      up assessment by telephone will be completed.
