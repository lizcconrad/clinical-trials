             during the trial)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the normal reference range that is of clinical relevance
             at screening, according to the judgment of the investigator

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen required by the protocol

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  Infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses (defined as either being hepatitis B
