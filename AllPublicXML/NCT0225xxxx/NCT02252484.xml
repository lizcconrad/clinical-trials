    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a weight management program for
      men undergoing a prostatectomy by seeing if the program is easy to follow, impacts weight
      gain, and reduces risk of cancer recurrence in the participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The weight management program is designed to help participants lose weight before their
      prostatectomy and to help them maintain that weight loss after surgery. There are four main
      components to the weight management program. The four components of the program are:

        1. Diet

        2. Physical activity

        3. Coaching

        4. Diet and exercise monitoring tool

      The program will be tailored to each individual participant. All participants will be ask to
      monitor their program using a tool provided by the study team. Participants will be actively
      participating in the study activities for about 5 months. After that, the study team will
      review medical records for up to 10 years after enrollment to monitor weight changes and
      cancer status.

    <description>Participants will receive tailor weight loss program. Participants will complete 8-weeks of the weight loss intervention prior to having their prostatectomy (weight loss phase). Program includes individual weight coaching, tailored diet and exercise plan, weight coaching and tracking of daily activities. Sessions will be held weekly during the weight loss phase. The groups will be facilitated by a registered dietitian with genitourinary (GU) oncology experience.</description>
