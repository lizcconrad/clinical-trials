  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if the systemic drug exposure of at least 25 μg
      and perhaps 50 μg salmeterol presented as inhalation powder in PE capsules and administered
      via HandiHaler® 2 does not exceed that of 50 μg Serevent® Diskus® and to investigate safety
      and tolerability of salmeterol presented as inhalation powder in PE capsules and administered
      via HandiHaler® 2

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs ((Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead
             ECG measurement, and clinical laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance. There is no evidence of a clinically relevant
             concomitant disease.

          2. Age ≥21 and ≤50 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG measurements)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          2. Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          8. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than
             10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to randomization

          9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the
             knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to randomization

         14. Drug abuse

         15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to randomization or during
             the trial)

         16. Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomization or during the trial

         17. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

         18. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre

             The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class
             side effect profile of ß2-mimetics:

         20. Hyperthyrosis
