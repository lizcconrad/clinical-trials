  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a school-based exercise program on
      posture, trunk range of motion and musculoskeletal pain in schoolchildren. This study was a
      Randomized controlled trial. The hypothesis was that the exercise group would have the
      postural deviations corrected, would have the trunk range of motion increased and would have
      the prevalence of pain decreased, while the control group would have not. Three schools from
      Brazil participated. The students that have been included (n=300) were randomly allocated to
      experimental (EG) or control group (CG). The intervention for EG consisted in a program based
      on stretching and strengthening exercises, applied twice a week, for eight weeks, with group
      sessions of 50 minutes. CG did not perform any intervention. Qualitative and quantitative
      postural evaluation (PAS/SAPO), musculoskeletal pain (self-report) and trunk mobility were
      collected.

    <measure>Changes in the qualitative postural assessment from the baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points: baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative postural assessment was performed by a physiotherapist through the photographic records. The photos were recorded with the students in swimsuits and no shoes. The subject was positioned over the gyratory platform to avoid reposition for the photographic record, besides the plumb line, with the feet lined and separated by hip width. The records were performed in the frontal and sagittal planes, in the anterior, posterior and lateral view. According to the positioning of the structures in relation to the plumb line, the presence of postural changes was classified by the physiotherapist. Lateral tilt and forward head, shoulder protrusion, cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis were evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the quantitative postural assessment from the baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points: baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Postural Assessment Software (PAS/SAPo) was used to quantitatively assess posture. Reflective markers were placed by a trained physiotherapist on the anatomical landmarks of the subject. The subject was positioned over the gyratory platform, and photographic records were performed in the frontal and sagittal planes, in the anterior, posterior and lateral view.
The analysis followed the guidelines of PAS/SAPo. The photos were aligned and calibrated. The reflective markers were identified and the protocol of measures of the PAS/SAPo was used, providing the following parameters: horizontal alignment of the acromions, horizontal alignment of the ASIS, angle between acromions and ASIS, vertical alignment of the trunk, horizontal alignment of the pelvis, horizontal alignment of the head, vertical alignment of the head.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in trunk range of motion from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points: baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A photogrammetric technique was used to measure the trunk flexion angle. This angle is formed between the line joining the markers attached on anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and greater trochanter and the line joining the marker fixed on the spinous process of the C7 vertebra and the one fixed on the ASIS. Two photographs were recorded; one in the upright position and the other in maximum trunk flexion. The trunk mobility was estimated by the difference between the values obtained in the two photographs. This procedure was performed in PAS/SAPo software.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points: baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of pain was evaluated by self-report. The Nordic Questionnaire of Musculoskeletal Symptoms body map was used to provide pain localization and data from musculoskeletal pain during the last 7 days. The pain intensity was also investigated by asking to the children about their pain in a 11-point scale, in which 0 is lack of pain and 10 is the greatest pain that the children had ever experienced.</description>

    <description>The exercise program was applied, twice a week, for 8 weeks, with sessions of 50 minutes, in groups of 10 students. The exercise program was elaborate to restore muscular balance through flexibility, endurance and muscular strength. To promote flexibility stretching exercises for rotator neck muscles, lateral neck flexors, levator scapulae, upper trapezius, erector spinae, major and minor pectoralis, rhomboids, spinal lateral flexors, column rotators, piriformis, hamstrings, quadriceps, hip adductors and abductors were applied. Strengthening exercises were applied for the development of strength, endurance and control of deep flexor muscles of the cervical spine, stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint and scapula, abdominals, spine extensors and hip extensors.</description>
