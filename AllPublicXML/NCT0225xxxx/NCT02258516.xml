      Purpose of the study - The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a
      new, theoretically based intervention to improve medication adherence in persons with HF. The
      hypotheses include:

      Hypothesis I. Poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF who receive the intervention
      (n=40) will be more adherent to medicines during the12-month intervention than a control
      group (n=40) of poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF.

      Hypothesis II. Poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF who receive the intervention
      (n=40) will have fewer hospital readmissions (HR) and emergency department (ED) visits during
      the 12-month intervention than a control group of poorly adherent patients with symptomatic
      HF.

      Study Activities and population - A prospective, randomized controlled design will be used to
      pilot test the efficacy of a new intervention to promote adherence to the medication regimen
      in chronic heart failure in the clinical setting. The initial development and feasibility
      testing of the intervention is complete (Preliminary Work, Section 4.5).

      Patients with HF symptom exacerbation (n = 80) who exhibit high likelihood of poor adherence,
      as determined by a validated screening measure, the Medication Adherence Scale (MAS)89 at
      baseline assessment, will be recruited and randomized to receive the intervention or usual
      care with attention control. Medication adherence, symptom frequency and intensity, hospital
      readmissions (HR) and emergency department (ED) visits will be assessed in both groups at 3,
      6 and 12-month clinic visits. The intervals between visits are considered sufficient to
      minimize sensitization bias to psychometric measures. Longitudinal measurement is required to
      evaluate the magnitude of change in adherence and symptom-related events occurring over time.
      Efficacy will be measured as improved adherence (primary outcome) and decreased HR and ED
      visits (secondary outcomes) in the intervention group as compared to the attention control
      group at 12 months. The study will close when all patients have had a 12-month
      post-enrollment clinic visit.

      Data Analysis &amp; Safety/Risk Considerations - The investigators will use generalized linear
      models to test the primary and secondary hypotheses (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Logistic
      generalizations of the traditional, multivariate GLM are appropriate when the dependent
      variable is binary and the probability of an event is modeled, as is the case with adherence
      in this study. When the dependent variable is a count, a commonly used generalized model uses
      the natural logarithm of the count, as with re-hospitalizations and ED visits in this study.
      In compliance with NIH guidelines for data safety and monitoring activities, a number of
      quality control steps will be used to ensure the on-going safety of participants and the
      scientific integrity of this feasibility intervention study. The proposed study poses only
      very minimal risks to participants. All participants will receive usual care. Participation
      in the study will not replace patients' regular health care attention. Data safety will be
      monitored by the PI, the Data Safety Officer (Dr. Karl Swedberg), and the study
      co-investigators. Any adverse events will be reported immediately to the Duke IRB and the
      NIH.

      Data Safety. First, a project database will be constructed, using participant ID numbers and
      including all demographic, pre- and post-intervention history and all assessment materials. A
      separate file, cross-referencing participant identification with project ID numbers, will be
      maintained with access limited to the PI or a designated member of the investigative team.
