      Obesity is a common health problem in developed countries. At present,the medical staff have
      already been alerted that the obesity is a kind of disease actually and one of the epidemic
      diseases which erode the human health in the world. It is not only about the person`s health
      but also a main public health problem. It has been caught to our attention that some
      diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases,diabetes, and high blood pressure are coming along
      with overweight and obesity. Recent studies had demonstrated a positive correlation between
      chronic diseases and obesity. There are many treatments for the obesity, in general,
      acupuncture may be an effective one. Acupuncture may suppress the people`s appetite, slow
      down the stomach`s creeping motion, and increase the stomach`s evacuation time.
      Simultaneously, acupuncture controls the body through the absorption and storage of the
      calorie via the adjustment of the endocrine system. But we still need a more efficiency way
      to accelerate the body fat metabolism and decrease the storage of the fat in vivo. Therefore,
      the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of combination of acupuncture and ayuveda
      yoga exercise on weight loss among the overweight.
