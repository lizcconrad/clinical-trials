  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a more effective way of treating solid tumors. This
      study will test the safety, bio-distribution, and tumor uptake of a new treatment for cancer
      called DS-8895a in patients with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation, non-randomized, open label, single site study of DS-8895a in
      patients with advanced or metastatic EphA2 positive cancers. Patients will receive an initial
      89Zr trace labelled infusion of DS-8895a, followed by safety assessments, PET imaging and
      pharmacokinetic sampling over a one week period. DS-8895a will then be infused on Day 8, and
      second weekly infusions of DS-8895a, for a further two infusions, will subsequently occur.
      The day 36 infusion of DS-8895a will also be trace labelled with 89Zr, with subsequent PET
      imaging and pharmacokinetic sampling. Four dose levels (1, 3, 10 and 20mg/kg) will be
      evaluated, with 3-6 patients entered at each dose level. Those patients who respond or have
      stable disease on RECIST at Day 50 restaging may continue on biweekly treatment of DS-8895a
      until disease progression, with restaging CT scans every 6 weeks.
