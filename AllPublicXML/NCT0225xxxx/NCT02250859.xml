      This is an open-label, single-center, non-randomized, multiple-administrations study in males
      and females, some of which are with acne.

      Twelve (12) subjects will be enrolled to receive a daily dose of topical FMX-101 minocycline
      (4%) foam for sixteen consecutive days.

      Each subject will undergo screening procedures within 21 days prior to dosing, to assess his
      eligibility to participate in the study, including a dermatological assessment of the acne
      severity and distribution (for subjects with acne).

      On Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 and 17 blood will be drawn for PK An End-of Study/Safety
      Follow-up visit will take place on 7-10 days after last dose, which will also include a
      dermatological assessment of response to treatment
