      Can perioperative administration of intra-peritoneal local anaesthetics further reduce
      postoperative pain, inflammation and outcome in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery
      (cytoreductive surgery) and managed with thoracic epidural analgesia? - Multicenter study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the efficacy of local anesthetics (LA) administered into
      the intra-peritoneal cavity compared to placebo. Our hypothesis is that the injection of
      local LAs intra-peritoneally would reduce post-operative pain and the inflammatory process
      caused by the massive release of cytokines during extensive cytoreductive surgery. The study
      is a controlled, parallel group, double blind, prospective, randomized and performed at
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden . Twenty mL of ropivacaine or saline
      would be injected every hour by an automatic pump via the intra-peritoneal catheter into the
      abdomen according to group randomization in order to double blind patients and all personnel
      involved in the study.

      The parameters that would be evaluated are inflammatory markers, postoperative morbidity,
      pain intensity, consumption of morphine, cognitive function and progression-free survival.

    <description>Ropivacaine is instillated through one multi-hole catheter wich would be inserted percutaneously in all patients and tunnelled about 1-2 cm lateral to the abdominal incision and the tip of the catheter placed in the intra-peritoneal cavity. The catheter would not be ligated and fixed in situ intra-peritoneally. Twenty ml of Ropivacaine would be injected subcutaneously along both sides of the incision prior to skin closure. Additionally, 20 ml of Ropivacaine (1mg/mL) would be injected every hour by an automatic pump via the intra-peritoneal catheter into the abdomen.</description>
