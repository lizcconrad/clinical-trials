      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program, a physical
      activity and healthy eating promotion program, in hypertensive from Recife-Pernambuco-
      Brazil. Approximately 90 subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension, under anti-hypertensive
      medication and classified as non-physically active, will be selected and randomly distributed
      into two groups: a change behavior group (CBG) and control group (CG). The CBG will
      participate of a change behavior program, entitled VAMOS - Active Life Improving Health, for
      12 weeks and composed of a weekly meeting, in group, lasting about 90 minutes. In each weekly
      meeting, will be presented and discussed guidelines and strategies for practical physical
      activities in different fields and for adoption of a healthy diet in order that the level of
      physical activity and eating quality improve. The program will be evaluated by effectiveness,
      implementation and maintenance (initial and individual level) dimensions of RE-AIM framework.
      The effectiveness will be assessed from anthropometric measurements, body composition, eating
      habits, physical activity level, stages of self-change, self-efficacy, social support,
      quality of life and assessment of cardiovascular function at rest (clinic and home blood
      pressure, arterial stiffness, blood flow and flow-mediated dilation, heart rate and heart
      rate variability) before and after 12 weeks of intervention. The implementation will be
      assessed by identifying the extent to which the program will be conducted as planned. The
      maintenance, initial and at individual level, will be estimated from revaluations of all
      outcomes, as measured before and after the intervention, three months after the end of the
      program. For data analysis, in addition to descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA for mixed
      models wil be applied for for within and between groups comparison, if the premises of this
      test are met. The level of significance that will be adopted is P&lt;0.05. All analyzes will be
      done at SPSS statistical package, version 17.0.

      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program, a physical
      activity and healthy eating promotion program, in hypertensive from Recife-PE- Brazil. As
      secondaries goals, the study attempts to:

        1. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program with regard to physical activity, the
           sedentary behavior and eating habits in hypertensives;

        2. analyze whether self-efficacy, stages of self-change and social support mediate the
           possible effects of VAMOS program on physical activity, sedentary behavior and eating
           habits in hypertensives;

        3. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program with regard to clinic and home blood
           pressure, arterial stiffness, blood flow and flow-mediated dilation, heart rate and
           heart rate variability in hypertensives;

        4. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program on anthropometric and body composition
           variables in hypertensives;

        5. analyze whether the possible result changes brought from VAMOS program in behavioral and
           biological variables promote changes in quality of life of hypertensives;

        6. assess the implementation of VAMOS program in nonpharmacological treatment of
           hypertension in Recife, northeastern of Brazil;

        7. identify whether the possible effects achieved from VAMOS remain three months after the
           end of the program in hypertensives.

    <measure>change in clinic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will be checked using an automatic oscillometric instrument (Omron HEM 742-E0 - USA). The patients will be instructed to eat a light meal before the measurements, to avoid physical exercise and alcohol ingestion for at least 24 hours prior to the visit, and to avoid smoking and caffeine for at least 12 hours. Measurements will be taken in two non-consecutive days, after 10 minutes of rest in the supine position and three measurements will be done in each day, with one minute interval between measurements. All measurements will be taken on the left arm, in a quiet environment, with monitored temperature.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Habitual physical activity will be assessed by GT3X or GT3X+ accelerometer (Actigraph - USA) and Actilife 6.10 software will be used to analysis. Each participant will be instructed to use the accelerometer for seven consecutive days, removing it only for sleeping, bathing or performing water activities. The device will be attached to an elastic belt and fixed in the right side of the hip. Data will be collected in a 30 Hz sample frequency and will be analyzed using 60-s epochs. Periods with consecutive values of zero (with 2-min of spike tolerance) for 60 min or longer will be interpreted as &quot;accelerometer not worn&quot; and excluded from the analysis. Physical activity data only will be included if the participant accumulate a minimum of 10 hours/day of recording for at least four days, including one weekend day.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in eating habits</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Eating habits will be investigated from the number of meals daily, quality chewing food, dietary intake concomitantly liquids at mealtimes, habit of eating salads, raw or cooked vegetables, daily water consumption habits and intake of visible fat from meat and chicken. Also, the food frequency questionnaire will be applied, using a list of foods for which the average frequency of consumption over the last three months is given.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in anthropometric parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass will be measured with participants wearing light clothes and no shoes, using an automatic scale (Welmy - Brazil) to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height will be measured using a stadiometer connected to scale to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body mass index will be calculated as the ratio between body mass in kilograms and the square of height in meters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in blood flow and flow-mediated dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For assessment of blood flow and flow-mediated dilation, the method of venous occlusion pletysmography will be used (Hokanson - EC6 - EUA) with measurement being done in the left arm. A cuff will be placed around the left arm and another cuff will be placed around the wrist. A strain gauge pletysmography will be positioned in the largest forearm circumference. For blood flow measurement, the wrist cuff will be inflated and then the arm cuff for 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of deflation, totaling 20 seconds in each cycle. Inflation of the cuff will be made during the cardiac diastole, which will be perceived by an electrocardiogram. The measurement will be performed 12 times in a row, completing four minutes. The flow-mediated vasodilation will be assessed by vascular response to vasodilator stimuli using the technique of reactive hyperemia.</description>

VAMOS is a lifestyle promotion program, that includes physical activity and healthy eating habits. The program is composed by a weekly meeting, in group, lasting about 90 min. In each weekly meeting, will be discussed guidelines and strategies for physical activities practices in different domains and for adoption of a healthy diet. All aspects and strategies included in the program are based in behavior changes theories. The participants of this group will receive an educational material and, in the middle of the program, they will earn a pedometer to aid in motivation and in the self-monitoring physical activity.</description>
