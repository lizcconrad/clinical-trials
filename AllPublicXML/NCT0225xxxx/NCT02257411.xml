  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After institutional ethics board approval and written informed consent from parents, 197
      children scheduled for routine genitourinary operation and in whom a LMA was indicated for
      anesthesia were included in the study. The size of the LMA was determined by choosing the
      size that was best matched with the auricle of the children. The results were compared with
      the standard method recommended by the manufacturer's weight-related guidelines. The patients
      were classified in different groups depending on the PLMA sizes determined by both methods. A
      kappa coefficient evaluated the agreement between both techniques.
