  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome is a genetic condition, rare, due to the total or partial absence of one X
      chromosome, affecting 1/2500 newborn female. It combines almost constantly short stature and
      ovarian failure with infertility.

      Other anomalies are inconstant: morphological characteristics of varying intensity,
      associated malformations, and increased risk of acquired diseases ...

      The prognosis of patients reaching the Turner Syndrome is linked to cardiovascular
      complications (congenital heart disease, dilatation of the ascending aorta with risk of
      dissection or rupture of aneurysm), causing early mortality with reduction of life expectancy
      of at least 10 years.

      For these reasons, screening for heart disease and dilatation of the ascending aorta is
      established and is intended to prevent the complications associated with medical treatment
      and / or surgery to increase life expectancy and reduce the co-morbidities.

      On the vascular level, the recommendations other than those relating to the monitoring of the
      diameter of the ascending aorta include research of renal artery stenosis by doppler
      ultrasound if the patient is hypertensive and looking for lymphedema.

      However, other arterial lesions were described in the literature, outside of the aneurysm of
      the ascending aorta. These peripheral arterial lesions can also be life and / or functional
      prognosis of the patient. Ascending aorta dilation seems not to be exclusive in Turner
      syndrome.

      In addition, specific vascular lesions outside the affected artery are described: hepatic
      cirrhosis by vascular depletion, lymphedema and varicose veins. The prevalence of venous or
      lymphatic disease is unknown.

      A single-center review of 9 cases of patients followed at the University Hospital of
      Strasbourg showed the presence of vascular lesions discovered incidentally during assessments
      performed for reasons other than cardiovascular screening: cystic lymphangioma, internal
      carotid aneurysm, agenesis of the inferior vena cava, early varicose veins, embryonic
      cerebral artery, etc ... None of these patients showed any dilatation of the ascending aorta
      or heart disease. Peripheral vascular abnormalities in this patient group are exclusive.

      In this study, we seek to demonstrate that arterial disease in Turner syndrome involve the
      entire arterial territory and is not confined to the ascending aorta. Screening for arterial
      lesions should be performed on the entire arterial vascular tree and regularly in the course
      of time, especially as the presence of cardiovascular risk factors increases with the age of
      these patients.

      The venous and lymphatic vascular damage in the literature and in our series of cases in
      University Hospital of Strasbourg description should also lead to the detection of these
      lesions.

      These vascular complications can be alone responsible for the reduction in life expectancy or
      responsible for serious morbidity. Improved screening of associated vascular lesions is
      necessary to enable the best prevention of cardiovascular complications.

      It is also to establish the prevalence of vascular anomalies, whether arterial, venous or
      lymphatic, to better understand the disease and its management. By collecting systematically
      karyotype leading to diagnosis, it may be possible to make a link between the genetic defect
      and heart or vascular disease.
