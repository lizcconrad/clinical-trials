      The investigators will develop and pilot test an intervention called &quot;ACT for Parents&quot; which
      aims to decrease stress and improve quality of life in parents of children &lt; 15 years who
      have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. A small randomized trial testing phase will be
      conducted to gather initial data on the treatment feasibility and acceptability, detect
      treatment effects between groups (ACT for Parents versus Treatment as Usual), and to refine
      the treatment design for a future clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an intervention that fosters acceptance of
      uncomfortable thoughts and emotions as a coping strategy, and encourages engagement in valued
      behavior in the presence of these emotions. ACT has been successfully applied to parents with
      similar mental health presentations. Using a randomized controlled study design,
      investigators seek to gather initial data on the treatment feasibility and acceptability,
      detect treatment effects in a cohort of parents who have a child (under the age of 15) with
      autism spectrum disorder.
