    <textblock>
      Study to assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ) at 200 mg or 100 mg
      twice daily, depending on tolerability, and administered alone and in combination with
      tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) after a single dose (500/200 mg) and at steady-state (500/200 mg
      twice-daily)
