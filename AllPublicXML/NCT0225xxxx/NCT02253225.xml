    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine both resting state activity and functional activity
      during rumination and during self-processing to study the relationship between neural
      correlates of rumination/self-focus and self-processing in major depression and bipolar
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative rumination, a specific form of self-focus, characterized by repetitively focusing on
      one's symptoms of distress, and the possible causes and consequences of these symptoms, is a
      hallmark of depression. Nearly a decade of research has culminated in evidence that the
      tendency to engage in negative rumination is highly correlated with depressive symptoms.
      Rumination also plays a critical role in the etiology and maintenance of depressed states and
      predicts risk for mania in bipolar disorder. Despite the central role of rumination in major
      depression and bipolar disorder, there have been few studies to date investigating the
      functional neuroanatomy of negative rumination, and no studies of positive rumination. The
      few neuroimaging studies that have utilized measures of the tendency to engage in negative
      rumination have focused on brain functioning when performing tasks that involve processing
      emotional or self-referential stimuli, but they have not studied resting state activity or
      functional activity during negative and positive rumination. We are examining both resting
      state activity and functional activity during negative and positive rumination and during
      self-processing to study the relationship between the neural correlates of
      rumination/self-focus and self-processing in major depression and bipolar disorder.

        Healthy controls will be recruited through email announcements at MGH, internet website at
        Harvard, and flyers posted at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in the community
        (e.g., community centers, public libraries, coffee shops, restaurants, and laundromats).
        Subjects with major depression will be recruited through the Depression Clinic and Research
        Program at MGH and flyers posted at MGH. Subjects with bipolar disorder will be recruited
        through the Bipolar Clinic and Research Program at MGH and flyers posted at MGH.
