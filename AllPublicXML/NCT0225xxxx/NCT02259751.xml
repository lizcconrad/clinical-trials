        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male patients with acquired suprasacral spinal cord injury practicing intermittent
             catheterization under stable condition as determined by the investigator

          2. Recovery from spinal shock in posttraumatic patients

          3. Aged 18 - 70 years

          4. BMI range ≥ 18.5 and &lt; 29.9 kg/m2

          5. Documented neurogenic detrusor overactivity as shown by urodynamics within the last 12
             months prior to study start and confirmation by the baseline urodynamics (day 2).
             Detrusor overactivity is defined as a non-volitional increase in detrusor pressure of
             &gt; 6 cm H2O. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia may be facultative

          6. Written informed consent consistent with International committee on harmonization
             (ICH)/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation given prior to any study
             procedures

             randomization

          2. Treatment with drugs with known anticholinergic effect on the detrusor and/or
             alpha-blockers, 7 days prior to inclusion visit 2

          5. Use of agonists or antagonists at beta-adrenoceptors (The following drugs may
             nevertheless be used since they do not act upon beta-3 adrenoceptors in therapeutic
             doses: atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol, salbutamol and
             salmeterol)

             study

         16. Pelvic radiation therapy

         17. Use of indwelling catheter

         18. Any electro stimulation therapy within the 14 days prior to inclusion visit 2

         19. Significant hepatic or renal disease defined as twice the upper limit of the reference
             range, regarding serum concentrations of Aspartate transaminase ((SGOT) (AST)),
             Alanine transaminase ((SGPT) ALT)), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and/or creatinine &gt;
             1.4 mg/dl

         20. Diseases or any condition, in which treatment with ß3-adrenoceptors agonists is
             contraindicated

         21. Participation in another clinical trail 8 weeks preceding to enrolment in this study
             or during study period

         22. Patients with any severe medical or any other condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion

         23. Allergic to KUC-7483 or its excipients

         24. Patients with Diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 treated with oral antidiabetic drugs or
             insulin (any formulation)
