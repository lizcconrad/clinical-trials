      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  to show a superiority of hypnosis and relaxation over control group on neuropathic pain.

        -  to show a lasting effect of treatment on neuropathic pain one week after the end of
           treatment.

        -  to evaluate the clinical predictors of response to hypnosis (nature of neuropathic
           symptoms, severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, coping
           strategies, emotional regulation, response to the first session, positive or negative
           emotional reaction at the end of hypnosis sessions).

        -  to evaluate the effect of hypnosis at long-term (1, 3 and 6 months after the end of
           treatment).

        -  to evaluate the effect of hypnosis on emotional processes.

        -  to compare hypnosis to relaxation on short-term effects on pain,

        -  to evaluate the quality of life and the impact of pain on daily life: sleep, mood,
           anxiety symptoms, analgesics consumption , neuropathic symptoms, affective component of
           pain and pain catastrophizing.

           35 patients will be enrolled in each arm, to obtain 105 in total (3 arms). Total
           duration for each patient: 8 months.
