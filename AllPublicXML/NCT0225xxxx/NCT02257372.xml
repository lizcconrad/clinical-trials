  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the addition of UMEC (62.5 microgram[mcg]) when administered
      once-daily via dry powder inhaler (DPI) to Inhaled corticosteroid/ Long-acting beta2-agonist
      (ICS/LABA) twice-daily compared with placebo via DPI added to the ICS/LABA therapy over a
      treatment period of 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. This study is designed to investigate the
      addition of UMEC to ICS/LABA combinations at approved doses and frequencies for the treatment
      of COPD including SERETIDE™ 500/50 mcg twice daily, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol
      Combination (FSC) 500/50 twice daily generic products such as AIRFLUSAL FORSPIRO inhaler
      500/50 mcg twice daily or ROLENIUM ELPENHALER inhaler 500/50 mcg twice daily and SYMBICORT
      TURBUHALER inhaler at doses of 200/6 mcg twice daily and 400/12 mcg twice daily, over 12
      weeks in subjects with COPD. Albuterol/salbutamol metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) or nebules will
      be issued throughout the study for use as-needed (prn).

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the following
      blinded study treatment regimens in equal proportion (1:1): UMEC 62.5 mcg once-daily and
      Placebo once-daily. Approximately 230 subjects (115 subjects per treatment) will be
      randomized in order to complete at least 206 evaluable subjects. The total duration of the
      study will be approximately 14 weeks for each subject.

      UMEC is a Long-acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) currently under development as a
      monotherapy, as a combination product with a LABA, vilanterol (VI), for the treatment of
      COPD, and as a combination product with an ICS, fluticasone furoate (FF), for the treatment
      of asthma. The UMEC/VI combination 62.5/25 .mcg once-daily has been approved in the United
      States (U.S.) and Canada for COPD under the trade name ANORO™ ELLIPTA™ and is under
      regulatory review in other countries.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 84 (Week 12). Trough FEV1 was measured using spirometry. BL FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made 30 and 5 minutes (min) pre-dose on Day 1.Change from BL was calculated as the trough FEV1 value on Day 85 minus the BL value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of treatment, BL FEV1 (mean of the values measured at 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), type of ICS/LABA, smoking status, Day, Day by BL interaction and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose on Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and then dividing the value by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean was calculated by performing six-hour serial spirometry from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours and 6 hours. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made 30 and 5 min pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as weighted mean value on Day 84 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of treatment, baseline FEV1 (mean of the values measured at 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), type of ICS/LABA , smoking status, Day, Day by baseline interaction and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal.</description>

             infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: UMEC should be used with caution in
             subjects with severe cardiovascular disease. In the opinion of the investigator, use
             should only be considered if the benefit is likely to outweigh the risk in conditions
             such as: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months; Unstable or
             life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months; New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure

             conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject
             eligibility. The Principle Investigator will determine the clinical significance of
             each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude
             subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Subjects with the
             following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: Atrial

          -  Interactions: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers and strong Cytochrome P450
             3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors is only permitted if, in the Investigator's opinion, the
             likely benefit outweighs the potential risk.

          -  Severe Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class
             C) should be excluded unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the benefit is
             likely to outweigh the risk.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants had used one of the following inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) combinations for at least 30 days prior to Screening: Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol (FSC) 500/50 microgram (mcg) twice-daily (bid); budesonide/formoterol 200/6 mcg bid or 400/12 mcg bid; ICS/LABA combinations per study procedures manual.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who met eligibility criteria at screening completed an approximately one week run-in period and participants who met the randomisation criteria were entered a 12-week treatment period. A total of 266 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were screened; 236 participants randomized and entered into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 84 (Week 12). Trough FEV1 was measured using spirometry. BL FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made 30 and 5 minutes (min) pre-dose on Day 1.Change from BL was calculated as the trough FEV1 value on Day 85 minus the BL value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of treatment, BL FEV1 (mean of the values measured at 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), type of ICS/LABA, smoking status, Day, Day by BL interaction and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose on Day 84</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the curve, and then dividing the value by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean was calculated by performing six-hour serial spirometry from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours and 6 hours. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made 30 and 5 min pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as weighted mean value on Day 84 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of treatment, baseline FEV1 (mean of the values measured at 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), type of ICS/LABA , smoking status, Day, Day by baseline interaction and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal.</description>
