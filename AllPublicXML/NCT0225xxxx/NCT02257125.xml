    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of motivating/rewarding features in a computer based arm
      rehabilitation program. Half of the subjects will take part, besides receiving standard
      therapy, in a computer based program delivering a game like scenario with visual effects and
      monetary rewards in case of successful level completion, while the other half will take part
      in a similar program without visual effects or the possibility to earn money.

      Rewards not only increase motivation to train, but have also been shown to influence motor
      skill learning via activation of dopaminergic brain structures. In goal oriented tasks,
      receiving information about goal achievement has a rewarding value, which is further
      increased if performance has monetary consequences. Computer games often strengthen this kind
      of information by presenting explosions and other salient stimuli when a goal is achieved
      (e.g. a target has been reached). The current study investigates the outcome of an arm
      rehabilitation program, based on such a computer game delivered in two versions. Stroke
      patients are asked to use their impaired arms to perform goal oriented movements. Movements
      are translated into movements of a virtual arm on a computer screen. Goals are &quot;meteors&quot;,
      threatening to destroy a planet on which they fall, if not caught by the virtual arm. One
      version of the computer game delivers state of the art graphics including a number of visual
      effects and, if the planet was protected successfully, information about a monetary reward,
      whereas the other version of the program delivers schematic graphic objects only. Training
      time and intensity are kept constant and outcome measures, including standard clinical motor
      assessments, are compared between the groups.
