        Following exclusion criteria are of special interest for this study:

          -  Erythema, exanthema and comparable skin alterations

          -  For the boosting agents atazanavir and atazanavir plus ritonavir, subjects with a PQ
             interval length in the screening ECG of &gt; 200 ms or any higher degree of
             atrio-ventricular (AV) block were to be excluded
