  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of daratumumab in combination with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone to that of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of
      progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (a
      blood cancer of plasma cells) who are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy (treatment of
      disease, usually cancer, by chemical agents) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

      This is a Phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (participants and
      researchers are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), active-controlled
      (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a standard treatment
      or procedure), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time),
      and multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study) study in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are not
      candidates for high dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All the eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone (DRd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). Daratumumab (16 milligram per
      kilogram [mg/kg]) will be administered weekly for first 8 weeks (Cycles 1 to 2) of treatment
      and then every other week for 16 weeks (Cycles 3 to 6), then every 4 weeks (from Cycle 7 and
      beyond) until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Lenalidomide will be
      administered at a dose of 25 mg orally on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle, and
      dexamethasone will be administered at a dose of 40 mg once a week for both treatment arms.
      Participants in both treatment arms will continue lenalidomide and dexamethasone until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants in Arm B (Rd) who had discontinued
      treatment with Rd at 24 months may re-start treatment. The study consists of 3 phases:
      Screening Phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose administration on Day 1), Treatment
      Phase (Day 1 up to discontinuation of all study treatment), and Follow-up Phase (from
      discontinuation of all study treatment up to death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or
      study end, whichever occurs first). The maximum duration of study will be 7 years after last
      participant is randomized. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by PFS. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
