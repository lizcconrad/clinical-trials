  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim for the study is to measure intubation success rate on first attempt in
      management of the difficult airway, which could possibly allow us to determine at what direct
      laryngoscopic grade it becomes advantageous to use the McGRATH® MAC video laryngoscope.

      Using our primary endpoint for the study would assist us in determining at which modified
      Cormack-Lehane glottic grade by direct laryngoscopy our expert laryngoscopists use the
      indirect view for intubation of these potentially difficult airways. Secondary endpoints,
      such as time for laryngoscopy, time for intubation, glottic view, number of intubation
      attempts, and subjective ease of laryngoscopy performance, will be measured. Direct
      laryngoscopy is an important airway management skill every anesthesiologist is required to
      master. Since the introduction of the laryngoscope into clinical anesthesia practice,
      innovators have attempted to improve and perfect the design of the laryngoscope blade to
      facilitate endotracheal intubation. Prior to video laryngoscopy, teaching direct laryngoscopy
      has challenged instructors as they may have been unable to share the student's view. This
      challenge has been overcome by video laryngoscopes which allow direct vision laryngoscopy by
      the airway manager and indirect viewing on a monitor screen by an instructor.1-4 Video
      laryngoscopes improve visualization of laryngeal structures and may increase the likelihood
      of successful tracheal intubation.
