  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in ~ 2-4/1000 term infants and is a major cause
      of neonatal morbidity and mortality. To date, therapeutic hypothermia started within 6 h of
      birth is the only intervention known to be effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality
      of HIE. Hypothermia does not totally reverse the injury in many infants and is associated
      with side effects that may compromise its effectiveness. Low dose morphine is often used to
      reduce shivering in infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, but escalating doses of
      sedatives/analgesics are often required. Escalating doses of opioids and benzodiazepines
      causes respiratory depression and can either cause the need for or prolong mechanical
      ventilation.Agonists to the central a2 - adrenergic receptors are more effective at reducing
      postoperative shivering than opioid receptor agonists and provide analgesia and sedation
      without respiratory depression. The most desirable sedative-analgesic agent used in infants
      with HIE would: (a) have an excellent safety profile, (b) reduce shivering, (c) provide
      adequate analgesia and sedation, (d) cause minimal respiratory depression, (e) preserve
      cerebrovascular autoregulation, and (f) confer neuroprotection.

      Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in ~ 2-4/1000 term infants and is a major cause
      of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Resulting neurologic deficits include disabling cerebral
      palsy and abnormalities of speech, vision and intellect in 50-70% of surviving infants. To
      date, therapeutic hypothermia started within 6 h of birth is the only intervention known to
      be effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HIE. Hypothermia does not totally
      reverse the injury in many infants and is associated with side effects that may compromise
      its effectiveness. For example, hypothermia can cause intense shivering which blocks the
      neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia in newborn models. Low dose morphine is
      often used to reduce shivering in infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, but escalating
      doses of sedatives/analgesics are often required. Escalating doses of opioids and
      benzodiazepines causes respiratory depression and can either cause the need for or prolong
      mechanical ventilation. Agonists to the central a2 - adrenergic receptors are more effective
      at reducing postoperative shivering than opioid receptor agonists and provide analgesia and
      sedation without respiratory depression. More importantly, in newborn and adult animal models
      of brain injury, a2 - adrenergic receptor agonists provide neuroprotection. Clonidine is an
      a-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is broadly used (off-label) for several disorders in
      infants and children. It is not known which class of sedative-analgesic agents are the most
      beneficial infants with HIE. Little is known about how immaturity, end organ damage and
      therapeutic hypothermia affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of
      sedatives-analgesics. The most desirable sedative-analgesic agent used in infants with HIE
      would: (a) have an excellent safety profile, (b) reduce shivering, (c) provide adequate
      analgesia and sedation, (d) cause minimal respiratory depression, (e) preserve
      cerebrovascular autoregulation, and (f) confer neuroprotection. Several lines of evidence
      suggest that the a2-adrenergic receptor agonist class of sedatives-analgesics may have all
      these properties. We have developed a sensitive assay to measure clonidine plasma levels that
      will allow us to characterize the population PK/PD parameters of clonidine in these high risk
      infants. We have the tools, expertise and patient population to conduct a phase I/II trial to
      test the hypotheses that clonidine is safe and will reduce the incidence of shivering without
      adversely affecting heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation or cerebrovascular
      autoregulation. Data from this trial will inform the study design of a larger
      randomized-double-blind trial to determine if clonidine as an adjunct to therapeutic
      hypothermia will improve neurological outcomes in this high risk population.
