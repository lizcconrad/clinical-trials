  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that syndrome may substantially
      interfere with normal sleep, leading to significant impairment in patients' productivity and
      quality of life.

      The most common and potent of all treatment regimens are the dopaminergic agonist agents,
      which carry serious adverse events in their prolonged use despite their augmentation. A few
      basic studies have suggested a potential relationship between vitamin D and RLS. It has been
      implicated that dopaminergic system dysfunction plays a role in the development of RLS, while
      vitamin D has a protective effect on that system. This has been further substantiated by few
      clinical observations that showed prompt improvement of RLS patients upon receiving
      dopaminergic agents such as carbamazepine. Other studies have revealed low serum levels of
      vitamin D in RLS patients, along with remarkable improvement after vitamin D replacement
      therapy, as has been demonstrated in a recent pilot study.

      This collectively points at vitamin D as a potential, more natural and safer treatment option
      for those suffering from RLS. However, the role of vitamin D in RLS has not been effectively
      investigated. The aim of this 12-week, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      is to confirm the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and RLS and hence elucidate the
      efficacy of vitamin D replacement therapy in reducing the severity of RLS, with predictions
      that the results will contribute to better understanding of the disease and its management.

      Methods and Materials: This 12-week, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is
      take place over a duration of 2 years. It will be held in the city of Jeddah to assess a
      sample of Saudi residents of the Western region.

      It is comprised of a number of visits, with the first one consisting of a questionnaire that
      is to be answered regarding RLS, physical examination, electromyography, the objective
      multiple Suggested Immobilization test, and blood tests. The main purpose of the second visit
      is to establish a diagnosis of RLS.

      Clinic visits number 3 through 6 comprise the pre-randomizaiton phase. Their purpose is to
      determine the patient's adherence to trial procedures and pharmacological treatment.

      Then, patients are to visit the clinic every two weeks for the first two months, then at week
      12. Patients will be assessed in regards to treatment response and adverse effects through
      history and physical examination along with further blood tests.

      Aim: to confirm the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and RLS and hence elucidate the
      efficacy of vitamin D replacement therapy in reducing the severity of RLS, with predictions
      that the results will contribute to better understanding of the disease and its management.

    <description>â€¢ All patients will have their serum vitamin D levels measured at the baseline visit. Those assigned to the treatment arm (group A) will receive either 50,000 international units of vitamin D3 by mouth once or more per week for six to eight weeks, then 800 to 1000 (or more) international units of vitamin D3 daily thereafter, this is according to the recommendations of the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline 2011. Group B patients will receive placebo supplements identical in appearance to the vitamin D supplements.</description>
