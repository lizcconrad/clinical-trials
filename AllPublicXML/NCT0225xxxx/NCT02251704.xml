  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This epidemiology study is planned to run in parallel with the EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003
      studies, enrolling from the same HDSS (health and demographic surveillance system) (or
      equivalent system) populations. The primary objectives are to produce longitudinal estimates
      of parasite prevalence in humans, and record malaria control measure usage in areas where
      EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003 studies will take place.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine annual cross sectional surveys at peak transmission will provide point estimates of
      parasite prevalence and subsequently a longitudinal assessment of the level of endemicity in
      each area covered by EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003. This study will be conducted in parallel to
      EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003 in order to assess parasite prevalence and malaria control
      measures before (EPI-MAL-002) and after (EPI-MAL-003) vaccine introduction.

      By taking into account variations in MTI (malaria transmission intensity) and malaria control
      intervention coverage, it will be possible to estimate more accurately the vaccine impact on
      clinical disease during EPI-MAL-003.
