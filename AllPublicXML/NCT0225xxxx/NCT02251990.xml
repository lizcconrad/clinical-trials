  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-site, multinational,
      double-blind followed by open label period, Phase 3 trial of 100 mg of grazoprevir (MK-5172)
      in combination with 50 mg of elbasvir (MK-8742) (grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination
      [FDC]) in treatment-naïve (TN) participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype
      (GT) 1, 4 or 6 infection. The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants
      receiving grazoprevir/elbasvir FDC in the Immediate Treatment Group (ITG) achieving Sustained
      Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy (SVR12) will be superior to
      the historical reference rate of 73%.

    <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 15 IU/mL. SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of detection (&lt;LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy. As pre-specified in the protocol, the Deferred Treatment Group was not included in the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The primary safety analysis compared the safety data of the Immediate Treatment Group during the active treatment period to those of the Deferred Treatment Group during the placebo treatment period.</description>

Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. A participant could discontinue from treatment but continue to participate in the study as long as consent was not withdrawn.

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an AE. The primary safety analysis compared the safety data of the Immediate Treatment Group during the active treatment period to those of the Deferred Treatment Group during the placebo treatment period.</description>

        <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess HCV RNA plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which had a LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. SVR4 was defined as HCV RNA &lt;LLOQ at 4 weeks after the end of all study therapy. As pre-specified in the protocol, the Deferred Treatment Group was not included in this efficacy analysis.</description>
