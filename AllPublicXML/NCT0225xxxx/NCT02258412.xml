  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immediate antimicrobial efficacy and persistence of two hand
      hygiene products on ICU Health Care Worker's skin flora by measuring bacterial organisms on
      hands using the hand print method. It is hypothesized that the product containing
      Chlorhexidine gluconate will provide more persistence than the alcohol product, resulting in
      less bacterial growth on the hand print plates. In addition, environmental monitoring for
      cleanliness will be captured from high touch surfaces in ICU patient rooms and common areas
      using Rodac plates and adenosine triphosphate tests.

      Crossover study with 50 Health care workers using each product with a minimum of 3 days in
      between. Products will be applied twice as per manufacturer's instructions for a Healthcare
      Personnel Handwash followed by immediate hand print. Persistent hand prints will be collected
      after exposure to environmental contaminants in the common areas. Hand prints will also be
      collected from one hand of 60 patients cared for by a participating Health Care Worker and
      gloved hand of Health Care Worker. All media contain neutralizers to inactivate active
      ingredients in each product and on surfaces. Each hand print plate's area of growth will be
      measured for Colony Forming Units using computerized software.
