    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, 3+3 dose escalation Phase 1 safety study.
      Adults with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma will receive macitentan in addition to the
      standard of care treatment for GBM. The study consists of a screening period, a treatment
      period, and a 30-day safety follow up period. The treatment period includes 6 weeks of
      concurrent therapy (macitentan+RT+TMZ), 4 weeks of monotherapy (macitentan) and 12 cycles of
      maintenance therapy (macitentan+TMZ). The study will end when the last treated subject has
      completed study treatment and the 30-day safety follow-up period.

      The planned duration of the study is approximately 34-38 months depending on the number of
      dose levels and cohorts of subjects enrolled. Subject participation in the study will be for
      approximately 16 months.
