    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and how well stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by wedge resection works in treating patients with early stage non-small cell lung
      cancer that is located in the outer, or peripheral, areas of the lung. Stereotactic
      radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation
      therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill
      more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Wedge resection is a less invasive
      type of surgery for removal of the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it.
      Giving stereotactic radiosurgery followed by wedge resection may be a safe treatment option
      for patients who cannot receive standard treatment with lobectomy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of a wedge resection following stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage peripheral non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pathologic response rates to SBRT as determined by pathologic examination of
      resected tumors.

      II. To prospectively assess patient quality of life when treated with SBRT and wedge
      resection.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the location of viable tumor and to correlate pathologic response rates with
      radiation dose, size of tumor, and tumor histology.

      II. To correlate pathologic response rates and functional imaging with pre- and
      post-treatment dual-input perfusion (DP)-computed tomography (CT) and positron emission
      tomography (PET)-CT.

      III. To correlate changes in serum levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and
      circulating tumor cells (CTC) with pathologic response rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery every other day for 3 or 5 fractions (depending on
      the size tumor and proximity to the chest wall). Within 4-6 weeks after completion of
      stereotactic radiosurgery, patients undergo wedge resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
