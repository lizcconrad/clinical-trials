  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to apply Whole-body DW imaging alongside the routine
      management of patients requiring systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer to compare the
      time to progression of individual liver metastases within and between patients following
      stable disease or partial response to palliative systemic therapy for breast cancer.
