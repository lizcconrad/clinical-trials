      The SENTINEL Post-Market Registry is a prospective, multi-center, registry using the
      CE-Marked Sentinel System in subjects with severe symptomatic calcified native aortic valve
      stenosis indicated for TAVR.

      Subjects enrolled in the registry will undergo TAVR + Sentinel. Basic demographic information
      and detailed procedural data will be captured and documented in a registry case report form.

      All Sentinel filters will be sent for histopathology at an independent core-lab.

        The registry population comprises subjects with severe symptomatic calcified native aortic
        valve stenosis who are selected for TAVR by heart team consensus and treated with CE-Marked
        TAVR devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Approved indications for commercially available CE-Marked TAVR devices.

          2. Compatible left common carotid artery (6.5 - 10 mm) and brachiocephalic artery (9 - 15
             mm) diameters without significant stenosis (&gt; 70%).

          3. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of
             the registry, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the Ethics Committee of the respective site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Vasculature in the right extremity precluding 6Fr sheath radial/brachial access

          2. Inadequate circulation to the right extremity as evidenced by signs of artery
             occlusion or absence of radial or brachial pulse

          3. Hemodialysis shunt, graft, or arterio-venous fistula involving the upper extremity
             vasculature

          4. Patients in whom anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, or who
             will refuse transfusion

          5. Excessive tortuosity in the right radial/brachial/subclavian artery preventing
             Sentinel device access and insertion

          6. Patient whose brachiocephalic or left carotid artery reveals significant stenosis,
             ectasia, dissection, or aneurysm at the ostium or within 3 cm of the ostium

          7. Currently participating in an investigational drug or investigational (non CE-mark)
             device study
