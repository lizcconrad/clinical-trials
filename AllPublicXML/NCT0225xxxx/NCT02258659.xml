      This phase II trial studies nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation) and carboplatin followed by response-based local therapy in treating patients
      with stage III or IV human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, carboplatin,
      hydroxyurea, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin before chemoradiation may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of chemotherapy and radiation therapy needed. Assigning chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy based on response (response-based therapy) and giving patients who are
      responding well lower doses of treatment may help reduce the occurrence of side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical complete response rate (nab-paclitaxel based induction, compared to European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition [EPIC] induction [paclitaxel based]).

      II. Response rate (nab-paclitaxel based induction, compared to EPIC induction [paclitaxel
      based]).

      III. Proportion of patients with &gt;= 50% shrinkage by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) (nab-paclitaxel based induction, compared to EPIC induction, paclitaxel
      based).

      IV. Toxicity (nab-paclitaxel based induction, compared to EPIC induction [paclitaxel based]).

      V. To assess swallowing function and speech at 6 months (mos) and 12 mos post therapy.

      VI. To determine the rates of late toxicity with chemoradiation following surgery as
      determined by xerostomia, dental decay, osteroradionecrosis, G-tube dependency, tracheostomy
      placement and dysphagia.

      VII. 2-year overall survival (OS) in patients treated on the Low-Risk, Intermediate-Risk Arm,
      and High-Risk Arms.

      VIII. 2-year PFS in patients treated on the Low-Risk, Intermediate-Risk Arm, and High-Risk
      Arms - early and late toxicities.

      IX. Evaluate need for post radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (RT/CRT) surgery on low- and
      intermediate-risk arms based on response from induction chemotherapy.

      X. Evaluate in a descriptive manner the role of transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
      resection/lymph node dissection (LND) when integrated into a de-escalation trial.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pathologic/histologic appearance of tumor after induction chemotherapy and
      after CRT.

      II. Translational research on blood and tissue samples. III. To profile tumors genetically
      and immunologically in order to assess in a descriptive manner genetic or immunological
      features characteristic of clinical behavior.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: All patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are then assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on response to induction
      chemotherapy.

      GROUP A (LOW-DOSE ARM): Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily for 5 weeks.

      GROUP B (INTERMEDIATE-DOSE ARM): Patients receive hydroxyurea orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      on days 0-5, fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5, and paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Patients also receive low-dose radiation therapy BID on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP C (STANDARD-DOSE ARM): Patients receive hydroxyurea PO BID on days 0-5, fluorouracil IV
      continuously on days 1-5, and paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      standard-dose radiation therapy BID on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 5
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.*

      *NOTE: At the discretion of the principal investigator (PI), patients may receive cisplatin
      IV over 1-3 hours every 3 weeks during radiation therapy instead of paclitaxel and undergo
      daily radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.

          -  HPV testing must follow the following criteria

               -  HPV testing using an E6/E7 based assay is preferred, and does not require any

                  Jordan/Lingen et al 2012); it is recommended that p16 IHC positivity is validated
                  at a later point (during or after treatment) using an E6/E7 based test at the
                  University of Chicago and provided slides will be used

               -  For non-operative (OP) tumors accurate HPV testing (i.e. ISH, or E6/E7 based

          -  No surgical resection for a head and neck cancer within 8 weeks of enrollment
             (although lymph node biopsy including excision of an individual node with presence of
