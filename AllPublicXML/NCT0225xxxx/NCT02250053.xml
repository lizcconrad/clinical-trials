  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of surgery and chemotherapy among people with colon cancer, 30-50% of
      patients develop recurrent disease. Physical activity has emerged as a potential lifestyle
      intervention to reduce cancer recurrence and improve survival among people with colon cancer
      (CC). This pilot study aims to identify the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on
      molecular and cellular pathways associated with physical activity and CC outcomes among
      patients with stage II and III CC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. histologically confirmed TNM stage II-III CC;

          2. completed surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (if applicable) within 1-24
             months before entering the study;

          3. ≤120 min/wk of self-reported moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity using
             the Paffenbarger physical activity questionnaire;

          4. age ≥18 years;

          5. written physician approval;

          6. no additional surgery planned within the 6-month intervention (including colostomy
             reversal);

          7. ability to walk unaided for 6-minutes;

          8. no contraindications to exercise using the PA readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q), unless
             physician approves participation with specific knowledge of this contraindication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. history of another primary invasive cancer (other than non-melanoma skin-cancer);

          2. evidence of metastatic CC (i.e., TNM M1);

          3. planning to receive any additional adjuvant chemotherapy;

          4. pregnant or breast feeding;

          5. unable to provide baseline blood sample;

          6. cardiac conditions, including the following:

               1. myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization procedure within prior 3
                  months;

               2. uncontrolled hypertension (systolic ≥180 mmHg or diastolic ≥100 mmHg);

               3. high-risk or uncontrolled arrhythmias;

               4. clinically significant valvular disease;

               5. decompensated heart failure;

               6. known aortic aneurysm;

          7. any other condition that may impede testing of the study hypothesis or make it unsafe
             to engage in the exercise program (determined by the investigative team).
