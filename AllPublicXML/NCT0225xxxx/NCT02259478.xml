  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high risk of IVIG-associated hemolysis (defined as receipt of a 28-day cumulative
      dose of ≥ 2 g/kg, adjusted for ideal body weight, and non-O blood group) will be
      prospectively monitored using a standardized protocol for signs of hemolysis, and will be
      undergo additional testing for variables that have been hypothesized to increase the risk of
      hemolysis. The goal of the study is to define the incidence and dynamics of IVIG-mediated
      hemolysis and identify patient and product-related factors that may predict which patients
      are especially at risk.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All IVIG orders received by the blood transfusion service at participating sites will be
      screened for patient eligibility. All non-O blood group patients receiving a cumulative
      28-day dose of IVIG ≥ 2 g/kg will be approached for enrolment. Exclusion criteria include the
      presence of an alternate cause of anemia, including blood loss, other drug-induced hemolysis,
      anemia associated with chemotherapy for cancer, or hemolysis associated with an underlying
      disease or participation in another ongoing study. Patients receiving repeated courses of
      therapy will be eligible for re-enrollment a maximum of 6 times. There are otherwise no
      exclusions on the basis of age, diagnosis, concurrent treatment, or specific brand of product
      received. Enrolment will occur at multiple Canadian health care facilities.

      Upon enrolment,case report forms documenting the participant's previous medical history, IVIG
      treatments and adverse reactions, and concurrent medication use will be collected. Laboratory
      testing for hemolysis will be performed at baseline, immediately following the completed
      high-dose cycle (usually administered over 1-2 days), and then again at 5-10 days
      post-infusion. IVIG associated. Hemolysis will be defined and graded as per the criteria of
      the Canadian IVIG Pharmacovigilance Group. The pathophysiology of IVIG-associated hemolysis
      will be characterized by tracking changes in serum complement levels, performing extended
      cytokine profiling, and conducting mononuclear phagocyte activity assays using patient
      monocytes. Secretor gene status, ABO zygosity and FcR polymorphisms will also be determined.
      A predictive model incorporating both patient factors (eg., blood group, total dose
      prescribed, presence of pre-infusion inflammation) and product factors (eg., specific lot
      number) will then be developed.

    <description>Any patient symptom reported during or within 10 days of an IVIG infusion will be considered as a possible adverse transfusion reaction. Symptoms deemed to most likely indicate an adverse reaction include the development of fever, chills or rigours; allergic reactions (urticaria, angioedema or anaphylaxis); pain reactions (including headache); respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath); and signs suggestive of anemia or hemolysis (pallor, fatigue, red-coloured urine, jaundice)</description>

In addition, patient samples will be sent for additional testing aimed at elucidating the mechanism of IVIG-mediated hemolysis. These include:
Cytokine panel profiling
C3, C4, ferritin and CRP levels
Monocyte monolayer assay using patient monocytes and implicated lot of IVIG against AET-treated group A1, B, and O red cells
Tests of eluted IgG antibody for subtype.
