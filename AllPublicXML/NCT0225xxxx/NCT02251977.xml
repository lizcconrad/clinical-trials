  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of
      monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity in
      colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is a key agent in the treatment of colorectal cancer. However, peripheral
      neuropathy markedly limits the use of oxaliplatin. Many drugs have been tried to decrease the
      development of oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity, however, the results remain
      disappointing. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to
      assess the efficacy of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing oxaliplatin
      induced neurotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based adjuvant
      chemotherapy.
