  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common condition in young adults. There
      are many safe oral therapies that require daily use to be effective. Because frequent
      follow-up visits have been shown to increase adherence to medication, we will determine if
      adherence to oral therapy for ADHD will improve with an intervention involving weekly
      internet-based contact without an office visit.

      The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of an Internet-based survey in improving
      adherence to therapy for ADHD. Subjects in this study will be either receive a weekly
      Internet-based survey assessing the prescribed medication and their ADHD, or to receive
      standard-of-care therapy in which they will take their medication. The following hypothesis
      is to be tested: A weekly Internet survey will promote improved adherence to oral ADHD
      medications.

      This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of subjects diagnosed with ADHD.Forty-four
      subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled. An Internet-based survey will be piloted
      to evaluate its effect on adherence to oral ADHD medication. Subjects randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of the state of their disease on
      a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and control groups will receive
      standard-of-care medication, stimulants. Adherence to the medication will be assessed using
      Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®) caps, electronic monitors affixed to the
      medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until
      the final (Month 2) treatment visit.
