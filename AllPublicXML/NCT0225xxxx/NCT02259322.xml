  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of two distinct behavioral treatments for loss of
      control eating following bariatric surgery:

        1. Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment

        2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

      These treatments will be compared to Standard-of-Care.
