  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at the effects of Meibomian Gland
      Probing (MGP) versus a sham (fake) procedure in patients with refractory MGD who have already
      tried traditional management with no success in resolving their clinical signs (as seen by
      their ophthalmologist) or their symptoms.

      The investigators are also evaluating the effects of using two (2) post-procedural medication
      treatments: Blephamide or GenTeal PM Night-Time to determine if treatment after the MGP
      procedure has an effect on its outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease is one of the most common conditions seen in ophthalmic practice and is
      associated with significant patient distress. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is among the
      most prevalent causes of dry eye disease. This condition, which is often due to obstruction
      of the meibomian gland orifices, may result in significant ocular irritation. Traditionally,
      management of MGD includes warm compress, lid hygiene, and anti-inflammatory medications.
      This randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effects of meibomian gland probing
      versus sham procedure in cases with refractory MGD that do not respond to traditional
      treatments. Moreover, the effects of postoperative regimen will also be investigated using
      two different regimens. In addition to symptoms, the changes will also be evaluated in terms
      of clinical signs as well as in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) which allows study at the
      cellular level.

    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week Time Point</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-question survey used to measure the symptoms of dry eye disease. Each of the 12 individual questions rate one symptom on a 0-4 scale, with 4 meaning that the symptom is present all of the time and 0 meaning the symptom is present none of the time. The overall ODSI score is calculated by adding all of the values from the 12 questions, multiplying that value by 25, and dividing the resulting value by the number of questions answered. This results in an overall scale that ranges from 0-100, with 100 being severe dry eye symptoms and 0 being no dry eye symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week Time Point</time_frame>
    <description>A two-item survey used to assess the frequency and severity of dry eye disease. The SANDE score is calculated by taking the square root of the product of the frequency of symptoms score and the severity of symptoms score. The SANDE scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the maximal amount of dry eye symptoms and 0 being the minimal amount of dry eye symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Fluorescein Staining (CFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week Time Point</time_frame>
    <description>Is used to assess the level of corneal epitheliopathy that is related to dry eye disease. The CFS scale ranges from 0 to 15 scale, with 0 representing the minimum level of corneal epitheliopathy and 15 representing the maximum level of epitheliopathy.</description>

    <measure>Tear Break Up Time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week Time Point</time_frame>
    <description>TBUT measures the amount of time, in seconds, a dry spot appears in the tear film after each blink. Values less than 10 seconds are considered abnormal.</description>

Each of the 12 individual questions rate one symptom on a 0-4 scale, with 4 meaning that the symptom is present all of the time and 0 meaning the symptom is present none of the time. The overall ODSI score is calculated by adding all of the values from the 12 questions, multiplying that value by 25, and dividing the resulting value by the number of questions answered. This results in an overall scale that ranges from 0-100, with 100 being severe dry eye symptoms and 0 being no dry eye symptoms.</description>
