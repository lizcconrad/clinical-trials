      This is a study planned to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of MMR
      vaccine of SIIL delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or
      disposable-syringe needle in total 340 Indian infants aged 15 to 18 months.

      This is a randomized, observer blind, non-inferior, parallel group, multi-centre clinical
      study to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of MMR vaccine of SIIL
      delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or disposable-syringe needle in
      total 340 Indian infants aged 15 to 18 months. Sera samples will be analyzed by ELISA for
      seroconversion / seropositivity for each individual component of vaccine i.e. measles, mumps
      and rubella at 35 days after administration of a single dose of MMR vaccine of Serum
      Institute of India.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Normal healthy infants of age 15-18 months at the time of the screening and have not
             received their first dose of MMR vaccine.

          2. Previously received a measles monovalent vaccine at 9 months, as confirmed by the
             childhood vaccination record.

          3. Parents or legal guardians of subject willing to give written informed consent and
             willing to comply with study protocol.

          4. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and screening
             evaluation including clinical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infant subject participating in other clinical trial or planned participation in
             another clinical trial during the present trial period

          2. Infant with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, malignancy or receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy.

          3. Infant with history of allergy or systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine
             component or to a vaccine containing the same substances.

          4. Infant with history of epilepsy or a seizure disorder or neurodevelopmental disorders.

          5. Clinical history of measles, mumps, or rubella infection.

          6. Infants with leukemia, lymphoma, or any other cancer or neoplasm.

          7. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, endocrine, autoimmune,
             neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as
             determined by medical history, and physical examination tests, which in the opinion of
             the investigator, might interfere with the study objectives

          8. Infant with any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator would
             jeopardize the safety or rights of the infant participating in the study or making it
             unlikely the subject could complete the protocol.
