  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of two monoclonal
      antibodies, VRC01 and VRC01LS, in HIV-exposed infants who are at increased risk of
      mother-to-child HIV transmission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRC01 and VRC01LS are anti-HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help prevent
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This study will enroll HIV-infected mothers who are at
      increased risk of passing HIV on to their children. The purpose of this study is to assess
      the safety and PK of VRC01 and VRC01LS in HIV-exposed infants.

      This study will enroll mother-infant pairs into four groups. Infants enrolled in Dose Group 1
      and Dose Group 2 will receive a single VRC01 injection less than 72 hours after birth.
      Infants in Dose Group 3 will receive a VRC01 injection less than 5 days after birth. They
      will then receive additional VRC01 injections monthly for at least 6 months and no more than
      18 months while breastfeeding. Infants will enroll into one of two cohorts in Dose Group 4:
      Cohort 1 (non-breastfeeding) or Cohort 2 (breastfeeding). Infants in Cohort 1 will receive a
      single VRC01LS injection less than 72 hours after birth. Infants in Cohort 2 will receive an
      initial VRC01LS injection less than 5 days after birth, and a second VRC01LS injection at
      Week 12 if they are still breastfeeding.

      The mothers will not receive any VRC01 or VRC01LS injections. At study entry, all mothers
      will undergo a medical history review and a blood collection. Infants in Dose Groups 1 and 2
      will attend several study visits through Week 48. Infants in Dose Group 3 and 4 will attend
      several study visits through Week 96. Visits will include a medical history review, physical
      examination, blood collection, and oral fluid collection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Maternal Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documentation of HIV infection. Documentation of HIV-1 infection is defined as
             positive results from two samples collected at different time points. All samples
             tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. For this protocol, the results for
             sample #2 may be pending at the time of enrollment. Results documented in the clinical
             record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for documentation of
             HIV-1 infection. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          -  Able and willing to provide signed informed consent for herself and her infant

             [FDA]-approved antiretroviral [ARV] drugs when used to treat disease or prevent
             mother-to-child transmission are not considered investigational.)

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness or immediate life threatening
             condition (other than HIV infection) in the mother that may interfere with the ability
             to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

        Infant Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Born to an HIV-1-infected woman who meets all maternal inclusion/exclusion criteria
             listed above

          -  Allowable infant age at the time of enrollment is dependent on the Dose Group and
             Cohort:

               -  Dose Group 4 (Cohort 1): Less than 72 hours of age, and anticipated availability
                  to receive VRC01 immunization at less than 72 hours after birth.

               -  Dose Group 4 (Cohort 2): Less than or equal to 5 days of age, and anticipated
                  availability to receive VRC01 immunization no more than 5 days after birth.

          -  At increased risk of HIV acquisition defined as documentation of one or more of the
             following risk factors:

          -  Dose Group 4 (Cohort 1), only:

               -  Mother received no ART during pregnancy or mother began or reinitiated ART (after
                  an interruption of greater than 14 days), during the third trimester of
                  pregnancy; or

               -  Mother with any detectable viral replication (HIV RNA above the limit of
                  detection) at last measurement prior to delivery determined within 30 days of

                  historical documentation of lack of response

               -  Women who have a documented history of virologic failure while on NNRTIs but who
                  had no resistance testing at the time of viral failure will be considered to have
                  NNRTI documented resistance.

          -  Dose Group 4 (Cohort 2), only (African sites):

               -  Mother intends to breastfeed

        Infant Exclusion Criteria:

             other than the study vaccine (Note: Infant prophylaxis with any licensed ARV drugs
             clinically prescribed to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission are not considered
             investigational.)

          -  Receipt of or anticipated need for blood products, immunoglobulin, or
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes infants who require hepatitis B
             immunoglobulin (HBIG) but does not require exclusion of infants who receive hepatitis
             B vaccine in the newborn period.

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness, serious congenital anomaly, or
             immediate life threatening condition in the infant that may interfere with the ability
             to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

          -  Any requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 24 hours of life or requiring
             supplemental oxygen at the time of the VRC01 dose

          -  Baseline laboratory results:

               -  Hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count less than 100,000 cells/mm^3

               -  Absolute neutrophil count: for infants less than or equal to 24 hours old, less
                  than 4,000 cells/mm^3; for infants greater than 24 hours old, less than 1,250
                  cells/mm^3

               -  Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT])
                  greater than or equal to 1.25 times upper limit of age adjusted normal

          -  Dose Group 4 (Cohort 1), only: Infant is breastfeeding at time of enrollment or mother
             has indicated an intention to initiate breastfeeding. Note: if a child is breastfed
             prior to known maternal diagnosis (in the case of a woman diagnosed in the intrapartum
             period), the child is still eligible as long as breastfeeding is stopped by the time
             the child is enrolled and there is no plan to resume breast milk feeding.
