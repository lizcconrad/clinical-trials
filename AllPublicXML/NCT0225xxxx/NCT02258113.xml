  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using a novel
      reaction-time based visual field device Ocusweep compared to widely used methods. Addition to
      that. the aim is to validate a novel perimetry method (Visual Search Test, VST) which is
      based on reaction times in visual decision-making task, where the subject is allowed to move
      eyes and where the fixation is verified by the subject himself in contrast to standard
      automatic perimetry (SAP) where prolonged stationary fixation and external fixation
      monitoring apparatus is required. using a novel reaction-time based visual field device
      Ocusweep compared to generally used SAP methods. Those tests will be done for healthy
      volunteers and for persons with diagnosed eye or brain disease.
