  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project will offer psychotherapeutic treatment to Somali refugees with PTSD and
      comorbid khat dependence. In this case series, evidence-based techniques will be applied and
      adapted to the cultural background of Somali refugees in Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 500.000 Somali refugees live in Kenya. This group is especially burdened by high
      rates of exposure to traumatic events, high prevalence of PTSD and a high comorbidity with
      substance use disorders, mainly related to khat (catha edulis). There's a shortage of
      literature on psychotherapeutic methods that are applicable in this group. The aim of this
      case series is to develop modifications of standard therapeutic techniques to the Somali
      culture and to the needs of this group. Twenty successive cases will be recruited from a
      community clinic where refugees often seek for treatment because of psychiatric problems.
      Senior level psychotherapists will apply and adapt techniques and approaches like Community
      Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Relapse Prevention (RP), and Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET);
      all sessions will be video recorded. Regular supervision with external experts and group
      discussions will be held to evaluate and adapt the single procedures and techniques. The aim
      of this study is the development of a standardized approach that can be used in a Randomized
      Controlled Trial which will be conduced in the future.
