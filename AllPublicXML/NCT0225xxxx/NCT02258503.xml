  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pain of the elderly is even often unrecognized or trivialized and ignored in spite of its
      big frequency: the chronic pain affects 50 % of the elderly living at home, 49 to 83 % of
      those living in institution and 80 % of this population at the end of life.

      So in the elderly, the noxious character of the pain is more pregnant than at the young
      adult. The echo on the acts of the everyday life is fast, the activities decrease, coming to
      deteriorate the isolation and the dependence: the echo on the psychic state is frequent and
      the pain is a part of the cause of a confusional state. Finally, the presence of a pain
      distorts considerably the quality of life and can modify the state general as the desire of
      life.

      The evaluation of the pain appeals to the same strategy as to the younger subject but with
      some specificities, related more to the pathologies associated with the ageing than with the
      real age. For that purpose, the investigators have first of all scale of self-assessment as
      the numerical scale which is adapted to estimate the acute and chronic pains but this scale
      presents a bias because, certain patients do not express spontaneously their pain and this
      one must be attentively looked for in case of modification of behavior.

      So scales of hetero-evaluation were elaborated to solve the difficulties of detection and to
      care the pain of the elderly. One of these is the scale Algoplus® (5 items which allow within
      one minute a good quality evaluation whatever is the place of care) whose objective is the
      observation of the behavioral changes caused by the acute pain in elderly having
      communication disorders.

      Due to the demographic evolution, emergency departments are more and more frequently a place
      of consultation of the elderly. Indeed, the elderly represent approximately 10 to 20 % of all
      the passages in emergency department and 50 % of the patients hospitalized during the passage
      in the reception of Emergency department are elderly. Elderly care is difficult for a certain
      number of reasons (vulnerability, accumulation of pathologies and treatments). So, in this
      context, the evaluation of the presence of pain and its care are difficult in particular at
      the elderly with communication disorders.

      In a preliminary study in the emergency department of the Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, on
      700 patients of more than 75 years old admitted in April 2012, 32 % had a prescription of
      analgesic while 13 % only had a real quotation of the pain.

      The aim of the investigators study is to analyze if the systematic introduction of the scale
      Algoplus® in the evaluation of elderly during its entrance to emergency department could
      modify the prescription of analgesic.

      First period of the study :

      Evaluation of the pain of elderly patient admitted in the emergency department by numerical
      scale and then taken care according to the usual practice of the emergency department.

      A Clinical Research Associate will collect the quotation of pain by numerical scale and the
      analgesics treatments prescribed and their posology and route of administration.

      This data collection must be realized for 100 elderly patients of 75 or more years old
      admitted the Emergency department during one month.

      Training period :

      Training of the emergency physicians in the use of the Algoplus® scale.

      Second period of the study :

      Evaluation of the pain of elderly patient admitted in the emergency department by numerical
      scale and by Algoplus® scale then taken care according to the usual practice of the emergency
      department.

      A Clinical Research Associate will collect the quotation of pain by numerical scale and by
      Algoplus® scale and the analgesics treatments prescribed and their posology and route of
      administration.

      This data collection must be realized for 100 elderly patients of 75 or more years old
      admitted the Emergency department during one month.
