      To obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data from a well-controlled
      prospective clinical trial collecting specimens from healthy subjects t on vitamin D assays,
      and to establish a collection of specimens that will support future assay discovery and
      validation efforts.

      1. Obtain matched serum and plasma specimens collected from a minimum of 50 healthy
           subjects in two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range
           for a vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in
           adults.

        2. Obtain serum specimens collected from a minimum of an additional 450 healthy subjects in
           two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for a
           vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in adults.

        3. To store any remaining specimens for use in future vitamin D assay development and to
           evaluate as yet undetermined assays for the development of IVDs, including additional
           vitamin D assays
