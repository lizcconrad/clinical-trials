  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast enhanced 3D/4D (3 dimension/4 dimension) ultrasound (CEUS) provides visualization of
      the dynamic vascular features of the plaques, in a unique spatial format using three
      orthogonal planes and angiogram-like images. Therefore, the observer can utilize the entire
      vascular system in a volumetric manner (3D). The rotation of the intra-plaque neovasculature
      as viewed in various angles provides a realistic representation that is more easily
      appreciated. Inter-observer variability for individual plaques has been assessed and
      inter-observer variability and inter-scan variability (the analysis of multiple images from
      single patients in longitudinal studies) were dependent on plaque size, with larger plaques
      showing lower variability. Therefore, the proposed 3D/4D vs. 2D CEUS imaging of the carotid
      plaque will provide added value for the depiction of the and quantification of intra-plaque
      blood vessel density by providing a true volumetric viewing area. This data will be
      correlated to the subsequent surgical specimens. The goal of the protocol is to investigate
      the correlation of intra-plaque blood vessel density and hemorrhage to 3D/4D CEUS vasa
      vasorum using quantitative software analyses. The histology methods used for quantification
      of hemorrhage and vessel density analyses.

        Patients scheduled for endarterectomy due to carotid stenosis demonstrated on a previous
        imaging examination (exhibiting &gt;50% intra-luminal narrowing or a maximum IMT measurement
        of &gt; 1.5mm) or have experienced a CVA event (TIA/CVA) .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects with known carotid artery disease will be included.

          -  Subject must be able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide a signed
             and dated informed consent including consent for 3 year annual follow up.

          -  Subjects will be screened by asking each study subject if they have known or suspected
             hypersensitivity to any of the components of Optison, blood, blood products of
             albumin. In addition, each study subject will be asked if they have a right to left or
             bi-directional or transient right to left cardiac shunts. If any of the above
             questions are answered in the positive, the patient will not be eligible for inclusion
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential will be excluded.

          -  The subject presents any clinically active, serious, life-threatening disease, with a
             life expectancy of less than 1 month or where study participation may compromise the
             management of the subject or other reason that in the judgment of the investigator
             makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  History of acute occlusion requiring medical intervention of any artery (including
             aorta) within 6 months of consent.

          -  Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the components of Optison, blood,
             blood products, or albumin.

          -  Has known right to left, bi-directional or transient right to left cardiac shunts.

          -  Any known contra-indications as listed on the current Optison package insert.
