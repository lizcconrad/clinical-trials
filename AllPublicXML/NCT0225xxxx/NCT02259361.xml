    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of sustained-release oral dalfampridine in the treatment of
      upper limb deficits in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this double-blind randomized
      pilot study half of participants will dalfampridine, while the other half will receive a
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dalfampridine (ampyra), a drug with a mechanism for symptomatic management of MS among blocks
      potassium channels on demyelinated neurons, allows normal electrical conduction.

      Dalfampridine has recently been found to be associated with improvements in visual function,
      strength, ambulation, fatigue, and endurance in individuals with MS.

      Although this medication has a widespread effect, its influence on upper extremity function
      has never been investigated in a double blind randomized case control study.

      Following the fact that during the disease course, approximately 3 out of 4 multiple
      sclerosis patients encounter upper limb dysfunction the primary objective of this study will
      be to investigate the efficacy of sustained-release oral dalfampridine on upper extremity
      function in patients with MS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have the ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study
             provide a signed and dated informed consent and authorize confidential health
             information to be examined in accordance with national and local subject privacy
             regulations.

          2. The patient must have been diagnosed with clinically definite MS, at the time of
             informed consent.

          3. The patient must be between 18-70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed
             consent.

          4. The patient must have scored between 50 and 90 on the upper limb Motricity Index test,
             at the time of informed consent. This test evaluates strength during three essential
             movements (pinch grasp, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction). The selected score
             range criteria determine patients who suffer a moderate decline in function abilities
             of the upper limb.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Onset of multiple sclerosis exacerbation within 60 days of screening.

          2. History of seizures or evidence of epileptic form activity found on a screened
             electroencephalogram.

          3. Changes in concomitant medications to avoid related changes in multiple sclerosis
             symptoms during the study.
