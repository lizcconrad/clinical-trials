      All patients who meet inclusion criteria and who agree to participate in the study will be
      evaluated for classification of clubfoot reducibility (Dimeglio 1995), which characterizes
      the four components of clubfoot deformity including equinus, heel varus, calcaneopedal
      rotation, and forefoot adduction.

      Patients will be allowed to select treatment with either the daily massage and taping
      technique or the Ponseti casting technique. It is not practical or feasible to randomize
      patients as transportation and scheduling, as well as family preference and willingness to
      participate, are primary factors in the French physical therapy method of massage/taping.

      Once treatment intervention has been determined, patients will be enrolled into the surgical
      or one of two non surgical arms (French physical therapy or Ponseti casting) of the study.
      Research participation entails the retrospective and prospective review of data collected
      through standard medical care.

      All patients who undergo clubfoot treatment, may have the following evaluations:

      Standard-of-care

        -  Clinical exams- will be conducted at the initial visit, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 to 14
           weeks, 6 months, and 9 months following treatment. Also at 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3
           years, 4 years, 5 years, and 10 years of age and at skeletal maturity.

        -  Radiographs- standing AP and laterals of both feet may be taken at 18 months, 4 years of
           age, and at skeletal maturity (for a total of 12 possible radiographs over the span of
           the study).

      Investigational

        -  Questionnaires - at age 4, age 10, and at skeletal maturity: patient/parent baseline
           assessment.

        -  Radiographs- standing AP and laterals of both feet (for a total of 4 radiographs) will
           be taken for all adult participants.

        -  Movement Science Lab- at 2, 5, 10 years of age and at skeletal maturity. This testing
           may include walking with reflective markers and electrodes attached with tape to his/her
           legs, walking across a pressure plate, video, digital pictures, wearing a step monitor,
           strength testing, and an agility test.

        -  Physical therapy - at 4 years of age: developmental motor scale; at 10 years of age and
           at skeletal maturity: motor proficiency assessment.

        -  Brace compliance - patients will have a temperature logger placed in the shoes of the
           Dennis-Browne Bar at the initial fitting visit in the Orthotics department. At every
           subsequent clinic follow-up visit the Orthotist downloads the time/temperature data onto
           a laptop from the sensor reader (A piece of computer hardware which the sensor clips
           into and is attached to the laptop via the USB port). The Orthotist will then reset the
           temperature logger discs in order to monitor the next period of brace wear.

      The following additional evaluations may be conducted on the patients who also have surgical
      treatment of clubfoot:

      Standard-of-care • Clinical exams and radiographs will be conducted as is required by the
      surgeon. No additional radiographs are needed for investigational purposes.

      Investigational

      • Movement Science Lab testing may be done before surgery, 1, 2,5, and 10 years following
      surgery, and at skeletal maturity.

      In addition, relevant retrospective data from your child's medical chart including clinical
      history, radiographs, and data collected in the Movement Science lab, may be used.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this project is to help orthopaedic surgeons better understand and
      treat patients with a diagnosis of clubfoot. This proposed research will establish a protocol
      for the collection of relevant clinical and functional outcome measures on our patients with
      a diagnosis of clubfoot.

      The specific aims are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the outcome of infants who undergo one of two nonsurgical treatment
           interventions

        2. To evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention in pediatric patients

        3. To compare the long-term outcome of patients who receive

             1. nonsurgical treatment only

             2. nonsurgical early intervention with subsequent surgery and

             3. surgical intervention only.

                BACKGROUND: The goal of treatment for clubfoot deformity is to obtain a functional,
                pain-free, plantigrade foot, with good mobility, and without callosities.

                Nonsurgical treatment options are available for the infant patient with a diagnosis
                of clubfoot. Traditional non-operative treatment of clubfoot deformity with serial
                casting as described historically by Kite successfully treats only 15% percent of
                patients reported by McKay, 60% of patients reported by Harrold, and 64% reported
                by Price. Alternative treatment techniques have been developed, including the
                Ponseti casting technique and the French physical therapy method. The French
                physical therapy method of daily massage and taping has been implemented at Texas
                Scottish Rite Hospital with good or fair results in 59% (23 of 39 feet) compared to
                fair and good results in 12% (4 of 33 feet) using traditional serial casting. The
                Ponseti casting technique has also gained attention recently with 90% excellent
                results reported by Noonan and 94% excellent results reported by Herzenberg.
                Evaluation and improvement in these treatment protocols continues.

                Patients, who fail to achieve a plantigrade foot with either of these methods, may
                be treated surgically. Patients initially judged to have adequate correction, may
                later be noted to have persistent or recurrent deformity and undergo surgical
                intervention. For patients who present with a diagnosis of clubfoot that are beyond
                infancy surgery is the only option for treatment. As with nonsurgical
                interventions, evaluation and improvement in surgical techniques continues.

                Reports quantifying functional outcome following surgical intervention for these
                patients is lacking. For example, Garceau et al described and reported the results
                of transposition of the anterior tibial tendon in patients with recurrent clubfoot.
                The procedure was described to prevent recurrence of deformity caused by imbalance
                between muscles everting and inverting the foot. Since this report, numerous
                authors have described results of the transfer of the anterior tibial tendon for
                the treatment of residual or recurrent supination or adduction deformity in
                idiopathic congenital clubfoot. However, none of these studies have been in done in
                a prospective, quantitative manner and few have utilized measurements obtained
                through gait analysis.

                CONCISE SUMMARY OF PROJECT: All patients who meet inclusion criteria and who agree
                to participate in the study will be evaluated for classification of clubfoot
                reducibility (Dimeglio 1995), which characterizes the four components of clubfoot
                deformity including equinus, heel varus, calcaneopedal rotation, and forefoot
                adduction.

                Patients will be allowed to select treatment with either the daily massage and
                taping technique or the Ponseti casting technique. It is not practical or feasible
                to randomize patients as transportation and scheduling, as well as family
                preference and willingness to participate, are primary factors in the French
                physical therapy method of massage/taping.

                Once treatment intervention has been determined, patients will be enrolled into the
                surgical or one of two non surgical arms (French physical therapy or Ponseti
                casting) of the study. Research participation entails the retrospective and
                prospective review of data collected through standard medical care.

                All patients who undergo clubfoot treatment, may have the following evaluations:

                Standard-of-care

                  -  Clinical exams- will be conducted at the initial visit, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12
                     to 14 weeks, 6 months, and 9 months following treatment. Also at 1 year, 18
                     months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and 10 years of age and at
                     skeletal maturity.

                  -  Radiographs- standing AP and laterals of both feet may be taken at 18 months,
                     4 years of age, and at skeletal maturity (for a total of 12 possible
                     radiographs over the span of the study).

                Investigational

                  -  Questionnaires - at age 4, age 10, and at skeletal maturity: patient/parent
                     baseline assessment.

                  -  Radiographs- standing AP and laterals of both feet (for a total of 4
                     radiographs) will be taken for all adult participants.

                  -  Movement Science Lab- at 2, 5, 10 years of age and at skeletal maturity. This
                     testing may include walking with reflective markers and electrodes attached
                     with tape to his/her legs, walking across a pressure plate, video, digital
                     pictures, wearing a step monitor, strength testing, and an agility test.

                  -  Physical therapy - at 4 years of age: developmental motor scale; at 10 years
                     of age and at skeletal maturity: motor proficiency assessment.

                  -  Brace compliance - patients will have a temperature logger placed in the shoes
                     of the Dennis-Browne Bar at the initial fitting visit in the Orthotics
                     department. At every subsequent clinic follow-up visit the Orthotist downloads
                     the time/temperature data onto a laptop from the sensor reader (A piece of
                     computer hardware which the sensor clips into and is attached to the laptop
                     via the USB port). The Orthotist will then reset the temperature logger discs
                     in order to monitor the next period of brace wear.

                The following additional evaluations may be conducted on the patients who also have
                surgical treatment of clubfoot:

                Standard-of-care

                • Clinical exams and radiographs will be conducted as is required by the surgeon.
                No additional radiographs are needed for investigational purposes.

                Investigational

                • Movement Science Lab testing may be done before surgery, 1, 2,5, and 10 years
                following surgery, and at skeletal maturity.

                In addition, relevant retrospective data from your child's medical chart including
                clinical history, radiographs, and data collected in the Movement Science lab, may
                be used.

                CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION OF SUBJECTS: Patients with a diagnosis of clubfoot deformity
                seeking treatment in the Orthopedic Clinics at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital will be
                asked to participate. Spanish speaking patients will be eligible to participate in
                the study.

                CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION OF SUBJECTS: All patients without a diagnosis of clubfoot.

                SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:

                Data collected for this research will include the following:

                  -  Chart review- patient demographics

                  -  Clinical exams- including use of Dimeglio classification to record treatment
                     progress, assessment by physical therapy

                  -  Radiographs

                  -  Questionnaires

                  -  Movement Science Lab Assessment- using kinematics, kinetics, EMG,
                     pedobarography, video, digital pictures, step monitor, strength testing, and
                     an agility test (Pedi-Champ).

                  -  Peabody Developmental Motor Scales

                  -  BOT-2: Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency

                  -  Patient brace compliance, as recorded by sensor implanted in shoe

                Retrospective data from patients previously seen at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital
                for Children may be used for this study if all inclusion criteria are met. Since
                retrospective data would consist of collecting data from the patients' medical
                record only, a consent form for retrospective data will not be used.

                Prospective data from patients currently enrolled in clubfoot studies IRB#0101-037,
                IRB#0401-220, IRB#0903-545 will be used for this study if all inclusion criteria
                are met.

                RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECTS: All patients with a diagnosis of clubfoot who plan non
                surgical or surgical treatment at TSRH will be invited to participate by their
                orthopedic physician and his/her team.

                Patients with the diagnosis of clubfoot, who have been discharged from care at
                TSRH, may be invited to participate for long term follow up. These patients will be
                identified through chart reviews. Study investigators will identify eligible
                patients, and will contact prospective participants and ask them to participate.
                Retrospective data for these patients will be combined with long-term follow-up
                data collected upon their enrollment.

                Physicians/Investigators will only be recruiting their established patients and
                will not recruit patients unrelated to their practice.

                All patients treated with Denis Browne bar will be informed that temperature
                loggers are going to be inserted in their orthoses, and that temperature
                information will be downloaded at each visit. They will not be informed that the
                temperature information indicates whether or not, and how often, the brace is worn.
                Informing them that the logger measures compliance would influence the outcome of
                the study, and therefore cannot be shared with the patients.

                POTENTIAL RISKS: The risk associated with participation for children in this study
                is no different than the risk of a standard visit to an orthopedic surgeon at Texas
                Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, including minimal radiation exposure for
                radiographic evaluation of the feet. For adults in this study, all radiographs are
                considered investigational. The amount of radiation exposure, in addition to
                Standard Care, that may be received in this study is small; comparable to the
                everyday risk of driving 40 miles in an automobile.

                There are inherent risks in the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot deformity,
                including deformity, poor function, pain, need for surgery, cast problems
                (including skin breakdown, infection, etc.), and neurovascular injury. The
                interventions being studied are those that are currently being used for treatment
                of clubfoot deformity. These treatment protocols have shown good evidence for
                reducing the incidence of the inherent risks in the treatment of clubfoot
                deformity. Possible risks related to evaluation in the Movement Science Lab, may
                include skin irritation from tape removal, and muscle soreness following strength
                testing.

                There are no known physical risks associated with having the sensors (small discs
                about the size of a nickel coin) attached to the inside sole area of the shoe.

                SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: The Radiology Department will follow standard shielding
                protocols during each radiographic examination. Females 10 to 25 years of age will
                be required to complete and sign (parent's signature required on children 17 years
                and under) the TSRHC Radiology Department &quot;Pregnancy Screening for Radiological
                Procedures&quot; form prior to their Radiographic evaluation.

                PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY: All medical records and datasheets kept
                within TSRHC are maintained in accordance with hospital policy on confidentiality
                of patient records and services. All data will be kept in locked files and will be
                stored and managed in accordance to HIPPA guidelines. No patient information will
                be disclosed. Signed consent forms will be stored in the Orthopaedic Research
                Coordinator's Office.

                There is the possibility that the IRB may review the research information. The IRB
                may review data collected for the study, to insure that the research protocol is
                being followed and that patient's rights are being upheld. The IRB may contact
                research participants to ensure continuity in study records and ask participants
                about their experience with the study. This information will be kept confidential
                in accordance with HIPPA guidelines.

                POTENTIAL BENEFITS: This project will employ treatment protocols currently in use,
                but will attempt to employ them in more controlled and consistent settings.
                Patients potentially benefit by receiving treatment with improved outcomes compared
                to historic and traditional treatment protocols.

                BIOSTATISTICS: Interim data analyses will be conducted and reported after 2-5 years
                into the study.

                Interim reports may include early results of the two non-surgical interventions and
                early results of particular surgical interventions. Ultimately we will compare
                outcomes across three groups: patients who receive nonsurgical intervention only;
                those who receive nonsurgical intervention as infants with subsequent surgery; and
                those who undergo surgery only.

                It has been determined that we need to increase our target enrollment from the
                current number of 500, to an enrollment of 1000. This number was obtained from a
                power analysis provided by our biostatistician, as indicated below.

                Our biostatistician was asked to review our existing study data and determine the
                sample size we would need in order to get statistical significance in each of the
                following sets of comparisons:

                  1. Comparing the two treatments, at each severity level, to see which treatment
                     gives the better outcome profile.

                  2. Comparing the 3 severity levels, for each of the two treatments, to see
                     severity level correlates with outcome, for each treatment.

                His response was as follows:

                For Set 1, you will need to increase the sample size by 90%.

                For Set 2, you will need to increase the sample size by 20%. Using the data given,
                the only significant result was seen for the PT group, showing a correlation of
                severity with outcome. The result is in the expected direction, with more severe
                disease leading to a higher probability of a Poor outcome.

                RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT: The goal of this study is to better quantify and follow
                the results of treatment. The results of this study will help to improve treatment
                provided to future patients. The investigators can not assure subjects that they
                will benefit from their participation in this study, and no compensation will be
                offered for their participation. This goals and methods of the project will be
                discussed with the subjects for purposes of informed participation.
