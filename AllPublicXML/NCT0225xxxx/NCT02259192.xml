  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      implanting a cochlear implant (CI) in the profoundly deaf ear of an adult with one normal
      hearing (NH) ear (termed &quot;single-sided deaf&quot; person, or SSD). The potential subjects will
      have been deafened post-lingually, thus, at one point the now deafened ear did conduct sound
      from the periphery. The MED-EL CI system will be implanted in ten (10) SSD patients.The
      long-term goal of this research program is to determine whether the CI, in combination with
      the NH ear, may provide improved localization ability and better speech understanding in
      noise, relative to performance before cochlear implantation (i.e., with the NH ear alone). A
      secondary long-term goal is to determine whether CI stimulation may reduce tinnitus severity,
      compared to tinnitus experienced prior to cochlear implantation or when the CI is turned off,
      after implantation.
