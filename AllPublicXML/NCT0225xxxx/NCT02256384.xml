      The study will evaluate the performance of measuring respiration rate with the Respiratory
      Acoustic Monitoring (RAM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine the reliability and accuracy of the acoustic respiratory
      monitoring (RAM) in comparison of clinically completed transthoracic impedance monitoring
      (TI) and manual counting of respiratory rate in postoperative pediatric patients at risk of
      adverse respiratory events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reliability/ accuracy of respiratory acoustic monitoring (RAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The respiratory acoustic monitor records three vital signs: Respiration rate will be recorded in breaths per minute, oxygen saturation will be recorded in percentage, and heart rate will be recorded in beats per minute.
The reliability and accuracy of data collected by the RAM will be examined by comparing to data collected clinically. The data obtained from RAM will be compared to both clinical methods: transthoracic impedance and manual counting of respirations. The accuracy of RAM will also be examined when a staff member goes back into the RAM recordings to manually count respirations during 10% of data collected on each patient. These numbers will be compared to the the actual data provided by the RAM.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Causes of unreliability and low accuracy of RAM and transthoracic impedance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The causes of signal drop off of the RAM and transthoracic impedance will be recorded. Items causing signal drop off could include computer failure or lack of patient tolerance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of false alarms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of false alarms with the RAM and transthoracic impedance will occur with the assessment of the first aarm of an every two-hour random sample of the recorded respiratory rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance of the RAM and transthoracic impedance pads</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerance is defined as the ratio of the time the sensor stays in place divided by the total expected time of monitoring</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of low oxygen and heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of low oxygen and heart rate will be recorded by pulse oximetry data.</description>
