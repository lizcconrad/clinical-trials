  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether combining interval training with skim
      milk supplementation will result in improved glucose control and markers of cardiovascular
      health in people with type 2 diabetes. Participants will complete supervised interval
      training three times a week over a 12 week training period while consuming skim-milk,
      whey/casein protein drink, or a placebo beverage that does not contain any calories or
      vitamins/minerals immediately and 1 hour after each training session. After twelve weeks
      participants will repeat baseline tests to examine any effects of the intervention on their
      glucose control, fitness, blood vessel function, body composition, and blood markers of
      inflammation.
