  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric, has been used for long term in the treatment of
      inflammatory conditions. Inhibition of NF-κB is postulated as the main mechanism responsible
      for the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin

      Aim : to study the effect of curcumin, 3g per day, as compared to placebo, combined with
      thiopurines in the prevention of Crohn's disease post-operative recurrence.

      122 subjects, operated on for Crohn disease, will be included in the study. After
      ileo-colonic resection, subjects will be randomized into two arms; they will be given either
      placebo or curcumin 3g/d per os plus thiopurines during 6 months in a double-blind manner.
      Rutggerts endoscopic score at 6 months will be the main judgment criteria.
