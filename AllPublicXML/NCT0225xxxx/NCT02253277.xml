  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it is the rationale to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined
      administration of nilotinib and increasing dose of ruxolitinib in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia and patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

    <description>The study includes two strata, which are to be treated in parallel. The first stratum consists of CML-patients in CP, which have been on nilotinib treatment before entering the study. These patients did not optimally respond to the previous treatment. The second stratum consists of patients with CML in AP or BC and patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL and Ph+ ALL patients with MRD, with or without previous nilotinib treatment. Patients will be treated with 300mg nilotinib BID during the escalation phase (12 months) with increasing doses of ruxolitinib. The dose expansion phase (12 months) will begin following the determination of the MTD of the combination and the decision to explore the cohort for confirmation of RPIID. In this phase, safety and tolerability of the MTD and/or potential RPIID will be further evaluated, with the purpose of establishing that this dose is suitable for use in this patient group.</description>

    <description>Nilotinib will be supplied by Novartis as 150 mg and 200 mg hard gelatin capsules. Nilotinib will not be dosed by weight or body surface area.

        function, with the exception of aspirin ≤ 150 mg per day or low molecular weight heparin.

        Patient must not have history of platelet dysfunction, bleeding diathesis, and/or
        coagulopathy in the 6 months prior to screening;

        similar chemical classes and their excipients;

        Patients must not take other investigational drugs within 28 days prior to screening;

        Patient must not be pregnant or lactating at screening and/or baseline;
