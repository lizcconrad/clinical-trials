  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase I, 4-period, randomized, active-and placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover,
      single-dose study to evaluate the effects of a therapeutic (1000 milligram [mg]) and
      supratherapeutic (1800 mg) dose of GSK2140944 with a positive control (moxifloxacin 400 mg)
      and placebo on the corrected QT interval (QTc) as assessed by continuous 12-lead Holter
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) in approximately 55 healthy volunteers.

      All subjects will receive single doses of GSK2140944 1000 mg, GSK2140944 1800 mg,
      moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo in a randomized sequence. A double-dummy approach will be
      used to maintain blinding. Thus, on each dosing day, moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin placebo and
      GSK2140944 or placebo will be administered.

      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to entry to the clinic. Subjects will report
      to the clinical unit on Day -2 of Period 1 and on Day -1 in subsequent periods. Subjects will
      remain confined until check out procedures have been completed on Day 3 (5 days confinement
      in Period 1 and 4 days in the following 3 periods). There will be a washout of at least 7
      days between doses. The follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose. Total
      duration of the study (from screening to the follow-up visit) will be approximately 60 days.

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the investigator feels and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19 to 31 kilogram
             / square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow

          -  These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
             correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible
