    <textblock>
      Patients with portal vein thrombosis, who have chronic liver diseases especially liver
      cirrhosis associated with low levels of AT III, will receive intravenous injection of NPB-06
      or placebo. The superiority of NPB-06 to placebo as anticoagulative agent will be verified in
      a randomized, double-blind, parallel-assignment design based on the proportion of patients
      obtained complete recanalization or partial recanalization of portal vein thrombosis.

      The safety of NPB-06 will be evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) observed between administration and 21 days after administration in comparison with
      the placebo group.
