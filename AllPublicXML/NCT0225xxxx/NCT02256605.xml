  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospecitve randomized controlled trial is to compare effectiveness and
      patient/family adherence of weekly or daily Vitamin D-3 dosing regimens in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who are 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] insufficient or
      deficient. The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of once
      weekly verses daily D-3 dosing regimens based on the most current IBD supplementation
      guidelines in improving 25(OH)D levels. A seconary aim is to determine if there is difference
      in adherence between dosing regimns.

    <description>Children with IBD, aged 5 to 17, who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient will be recruited at the time of a routine clinic visit or lab draw that included a 25(OH)D level as part of clinical practice/standard care. Once consent and assent are obtained, the children who are 25-hydroxyvitamin D [259OH)D] insufficient or deficient will be randomly assigned to a daily or weekly dosing regimen using block randomization to ensure equal group size.</description>
