  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two different strategies of Non Invasive
      Ventilation (NIV) have different effect on length and failure of NIV support in preterm
      infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

      A Randomized Control Trial (RCT) conducted in two tertiary level Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
      (NICU). Ethical approval is needed. Informed and written consent will be obtained prior the
      delivery from the parents of the babies before the inclusion in the study. All inborn Very
      Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants (Birthweight less than 1500 g and Gestational Age &lt; 32 weeks)
      with signs of RDS, spontaneously breathing and only supported by nasal-Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure (NCPAP) in NICU, will be randomized within the first 2 hours of life to
      receive two different Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) strategies: Nasal Synchronized
      Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (N-SIPPV) or Bilevel Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (BiPAP).

    <description>The NSIPPV is a conventional modality of mechanical ventilation delivered by the nasal ventilator device Giulia (Ginevri, Rome, Italy), that in noninvasive modality detects the inspiratory effort by means of a pneumotachograph, equipped with a fixed orifice (2 mm in diameter for LBW infants), positioned proximally to the nasal interface. Short bi-nasal prongs (NIV set, Ginevri, Rome, Italy), with different size according to infants'weight, will be used as interface.</description>

    <description>The BiPAP is a modality of noninvasive respiratory support that provides two alternate different levels of CPAP in which the babies can breath spontaneously. The BiPAP will be delivered by the Infant Flow-driver device (Infant Flow System, Vyasis Corp,Yorba Linda, California (CA),USA) and bi-nasal prongs as interface (Vyasis Corp,Yorba Linda, CA,USA) with different size according to infants' weight.</description>

    <description>In N-SIPPV, the physician will set : an initial PEEP of 4-6 cmH20; a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15-20 cmH2O ; an inspiratory time (IT) of 0.3-0.4 seconds; a flow rate of 6-10 L/min and a respiratory rate (RR) of 40 bpm with the lowest FiO2 to maintain a oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88-93%. Weaning from N-SIPPV will be performed with a reduction of the RR to 15 bpm with a PIP of 10-15 cmH2O and PEEP of 4 cmH2O and will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)&lt; 0.3.</description>

Weaning will start with a progressive reduction of the set pressure exchange rate ( minimum 15 pressures exchange/min), followed by the reduction of the higher level-CPAP down to 6 cmH20 and lower level-CPAP down to 4 cmH20. BiPAP will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a FiO2 &lt; 0.3.</description>

Short bi-nasal prongs (NIV set, Ginevri, Rome, Italy), with different size according to infants’weight, will be used as interface.
NSIPPV: In N-SIPPV, the physician will set : an initial PEEP of 4-6 cmH20; a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15-20 cmH2O ; an inspiratory time (IT) of 0.3-0.4 seconds; a flow rate of 6-10 L/min and a respiratory rate (RR) of 40 bpm with the lowest FiO2 to maintain a oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88-93%. Weaning from N-SIPPV will be performed with a reduction of the RR to 15 bpm with a PIP of 10-15 cmH2O and PEEP of 4 cmH2O and will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)&lt; 0.3.</description>

BiPAP: In BiPAP, the physician will set : an initial low CPAP-level of 4-6 cmH20 and high CPAP-level of 8-9 cmH20; a time high of 1 second and a pressure exchange rate of 20 bpm, with the lowest FiO2 to maintain a SpO2 of 88-93%. Weaning will start with a progressive reduction of the set pressure exchange rate ( minimum 15 pressures exchange/min), followed by the reduction of the higher level-CPAP down to 6 cmH20 and lower level-CPAP down to 4 cmH20. BiPAP will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a FiO2 &lt; 0.3.</description>

Weaning will start with a progressive reduction of the set pressure exchange rate ( minimum 15 pressures exchange/min), followed by the reduction of the higher level-CPAP down to 6 cmH20 and lower level-CPAP down to 4 cmH20. BiPAP will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a FiO2 &lt; 0.3.</description>

Short bi-nasal prongs (NIV set, Ginevri, Rome, Italy), with different size according to infants’weight, will be used as interface.
NSIPPV: In N-SIPPV, the physician will set : an initial PEEP of 4-6 cmH20; a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15-20 cmH2O ; an inspiratory time (IT) of 0.3-0.4 seconds; a flow rate of 6-10 L/min and a respiratory rate (RR) of 40 bpm with the lowest FiO2 to maintain a oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88-93%. Weaning from N-SIPPV will be performed with a reduction of the RR to 15 bpm with a PIP of 10-15 cmH2O and PEEP of 4 cmH2O and will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)&lt; 0.3.</description>

Weaning from N-SIPPV will be performed with a reduction of the RR to 15 bpm with a PIP of 10-15 cmH2O and PEEP of 4 cmH2O and will be stopped when the baby will not show signs of RDS and with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)&lt; 0.3.</description>

BiPAP: In BiPAP, the physician will set : an initial low CPAP-level of 4-6 cmH20 and high CPAP-level of 8-9 cmH20; a time high of 1 second and a pressure exchange rate of 20 bpm, with the lowest FiO2 to maintain a SpO2 of 88-93%. Weaning will start with a progressive reduction of the set pressure exchange rate ( minimum 15 pressures exchange/min), followed by the reduction of the higher level-CPAP down to 6 cmH20 and lower level-CPAP down to 4 cmH20.
