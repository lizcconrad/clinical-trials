      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, cross-over, multi-center study is to evaluate
      the performance of the Spectra Optia Apheresis System's CMNC Collection Procedure, compared
      to the COBE Spectra Apheresis System's MNC Procedure in mobilized healthy donors. Subject
      safety will be evaluated beginning with mobilization, throughout the collection procedure and
      for the day following the last collection.

      This is a prospective, randomized, cross-over, multi-center study to evaluate the performance
      of the Spectra Optia system's CMNC Collection Procedure, compared to the COBE Spectra
      system's MNC Procedure in mobilized healthy donors.

      Up to 60 subject may be consented to meet the the enrollment target of 20 complete subjects.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either the Spectra Optia CMNC or the COBE
      Spectra MNC collection procedure first, followed by the opposite on the following day.

      Study participation will be up to 14 days: a 7-day screening period, four days for
      mobilization, one day for the first MNC collection with additional dose of mobilization, one
      day for the second MNC collection, and safety follow-up the following day.

      Subject safety will be evaluated beginning with mobilization, throughout the collection
      procedure and for the day following the second collection.

    <description>The Spectra Optia® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself (centrifuge, centrifuge filler, pumps, valves, computerized safety and control systems, etc.), 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software. The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.</description>

The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.
COBE Spectra MNC: It is also a centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure is chosen as the comparator device because it is the reference after which design of the Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure was modeled.</description>

CE is a measurement of device performance calculated using donor and blood product blood counts collected immediately before and after the CMNC collection procedure. The collection efficiency for a given cell type is defined as the percent of processed cells of that cell type that are in fact collected.</description>

Spectra Optia CMNC: The Spectra Optia® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself (centrifuge, centrifuge filler, pumps, valves, computerized safety and control systems, etc.), 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software. The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.
COBE Spectra MNC: It is also a centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure is chosen as the comparator device because it is the reference after which design of the Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure was modeled.</description>

Spectra Optia CMNC: The Spectra Optia® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself (centrifuge, centrifuge filler, pumps, valves, computerized safety and control systems, etc.), 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software. The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.
COBE Spectra MNC: It is also a centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure is chosen as the comparator device because it is the reference after which design of the Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure was modeled.</description>

            <description>Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure followed by COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure.
Spectra Optia CMNC: The Spectra Optia® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself (centrifuge, centrifuge filler, pumps, valves, computerized safety and control systems, etc.), 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software. The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.
COBE Spectra MNC: It is also a centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure is chosen as the comparator device because it is the reference after which design of the Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure was modeled.</description>

Spectra Optia CMNC: The Spectra Optia® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself (centrifuge, centrifuge filler, pumps, valves, computerized safety and control systems, etc.), 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software. The Spectra Optia system's investigational CMNC procedure will be used to collect MNC from the peripheral blood.
COBE Spectra MNC: It is also a centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The COBE Spectra MNC collection procedure is chosen as the comparator device because it is the reference after which design of the Spectra Optia CMNC collection procedure was modeled.</description>
