      Dry eye is a chronic condition that decreases function and affect visual function with severe
      discapacity until now treatments are based in artificial eye drops. Platelet rich plasma has
      emerged as a strategy for cellular restoration, the purpose of this study is to evaluate
      their effects in lacrimal production and safety of this intervention in patients with severe
      dry eye.
