  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidences suggest that dexmedetomidine Pharmacokinetic are different in children.
      We performed a up-down sequential allocation study to determine the ED50 for rescue sedation
      following sedation failures in children and to investigate age-related differences in the
      rescue sedation with dexmedetomidine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 150 children who were not adequately sedated ( no evidence of adequate sedation within
      30 min after administration of Initial dose of chloral hydrate) were stratified into four age
      groups as follows: 1-6 month, 7 -12 month, 13 -24 month, and 25-36 month. The intranasal
      dexmedetomidine dose was determined by the success or failure of rescue sedation achieved by
      the previous patients, according to Dixon's up-down sequential allocation method. Successful
      sedation was defined as a MOAA/S(modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation) of
      between 0 and 3. The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of
      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Patients' sedation status, sedation induction time,
      time to Wake up, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded.

    <description>Children who were not adequately sedated ( no evidence of adequate sedation within 30 min after administration of Initial dose of chloral hydrate) received a bolus of intranasal dexmedetomidine which adjusted by the &quot;Dixon up-and-down method for rescue sedation.
The first child received 0.8mcg/Kg of intranasal dexmedetomidine dose (100mcg/ml), and the dose interval was set at 0.1mcg/Kg.</description>
