  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multiple-dose study of the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of NBI-98854 in a total of 36 pediatric subjects with Tourette syndrome
      (TS). The study will be conducted in approximately 18 male and female children (6 to 11 years
      of age) and approximately 18 male and female adolescents (12 to 18 years of age). Both age
      groups will be divided equally into 3 dosing cohorts with 6 subjects each. Ascending doses
      will be evaluated as part of a staggered-cohort design. Study drug will be administered in
      each cohort for 14 consecutive days.

          1. Have documentation of written informed consent, or written and witnessed assent from

             medications for a minimum of 30 days before baseline (Day -1), and the medication
             regimen is expected to remain stable throughout the study period. The use of
             tetrabenazine to treat TS symptoms is prohibited.

          6. Subjects of childbearing potential who do not practice total abstinence must be

          7. Adolescent subjects (12 to 18 years of age) must have a negative urine drug screen for
             amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepine, phencyclidine, cocaine, opiates, or

             study center and return for the follow-up visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have an unstable medical condition or chronic disease.
