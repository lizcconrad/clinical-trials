      The aim of this two-period study is to compare how much of the study drug gets into the blood
      stream when it is given as a single oral dose and when it is given as a single oral dose in
      combination with rifampin (a Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved antibiotic that is
      used to treat tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs, and other
      infections). Each participant will complete both study periods.

      The study will last about 34 days. Screening is required within 28 days before study drug is
      given.
