  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of multi-dose administration of itraconazole on the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of alisertib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult
      patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed refactory lymphoma. The study will look at
      the effect of the pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of alisertib in the
      presence and absence of itraconazole.

      This is an open label study. Participants will receive:

        -  Alisertib tablets 30 mg in Part A and 50 mg in Part B

        -  Itraconazole oral solution 200 mg in Part A

      Participation in Part A is 14 days. The maximum duration of treatment with alisertib will be
      12 months (approximately 16 cycles) unless it is determined by the investigator, with
      agreement by the sponsor, that a patient would derive clinical benefit from continued
      treatment beyond 12 months.

      This multi-centre study will take place in the United States.
