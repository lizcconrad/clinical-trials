  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy khat user with the intention to reduce or stop khat use will be randomly assigned to
      a one-session brief intervention or waiting list. Reductions in khat use will be measured
      from pre- to post-assessment which will be one month apart. After one month, the waiting list
      will receive the same intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leaves of the khat tree are traditionally chewed in some African and Arab countries. They
      contain the mild central stimulant cathinone. In recent years, the production, trade and use
      has dramatically increased and excessive patterns of use as well as a specific dependence
      syndrome have been described. So far, no experiences exist in psychological treatment of khat
      addiction.

      In this study, we use a brief motivational intervention based on the WHO's ASSIST-linked
      Brief Intervention and Motivational Interviewing to support users who have the intention to
      reduce or stop their khat use. Khat users will be recruited in the community. Trained local
      staff will assess participant's khat and other substance use at study entry and one month
      later. Users will be assigned randomly to intervention or waiting list control groups. The
      intervention group will receive a single 20-minute brief intervention. The waiting list will
      receive the same intervention after the second assessment. After two months, a final
      assessment will be made in both groups.
