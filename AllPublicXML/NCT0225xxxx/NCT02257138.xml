  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is made up of 2 parts: Phase 1 and Phase 2.

      The goal of Phase 1 of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of
      decitabine and ruxolitinib that can be given to patients with AML.

      The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if decitabine and ruxolitinib can help to
      control a certain kind of AML called post myeloproliferative neoplasm AML (post MPN-AML).

      The safety of the drug combination will be studied in both phases.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. Decitabine is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with several different
      types of myeloid diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It is investigational to
      give these drugs in combination with each other to patients with AML.

      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. All will take part at MD
      Anderson.

      Study Phases and Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants will be
      enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of ruxolitinib you receive will depend on when you
      join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of
      ruxolitinib. If no intolerable side effects are seen, a second group of participants will
      receive a higher dose of ruxolitinib. If intolerable side effects are seen in the first
      group, up to 2 more groups will be enrolled and will receive lower doses than the first
      group.

      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive ruxolitinib at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Phase 1.

      All participants in both phases will receive the same dose level of decitabine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. They may be longer, if needed for you to recover from receiving
      the drugs.

      You will take ruxolitinib by mouth 2 times every day (about 12 hours between each dose). You
      can take the drug with or without food, but you need to take it with about 1 cup (8 ounces)
      of water. If you forget to take a scheduled dose, you should take the study drug within 3
      hours after the missed dose. If more than 3 hours have passed since your missed dose, then
      you should wait to take the study drug until your next scheduled dose.

      On Days 1-5 of each cycle, you will receive decitabine by vein over about 1-2 hours.

      Study Visits:

      At least 1 time every week during Cycle 1, then at least 1 time every 2 weeks during all
      cycles after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If the doctor thinks is it needed, at the end of each cycle:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease, for
           cytogenetic testing, and genetic testing. If the doctor thinks it is needed, extra blood
           (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for these tests.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      Research Blood Tests:

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for substances in the blood that may be
      affected by the study drug and which may also predict response to the study drug. This blood
      sample will be drawn before you receive the study drugs, after Cycles 1 and 3, and then every
      3 cycles after that. This will also be drawn after you stop taking the study drugs.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 24 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End of Study Visit:

      When your active treatment on this study has ended (for any reason), you will asked to return
      to the clinic for an End of Study visit. The following tests and assessments will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease, for
           cytogenetic testing, and genetic testing. If the doctor thinks it is needed, extra blood
           will be drawn for these tests.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.
