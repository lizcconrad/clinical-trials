      The purpose of this study is to compare a single preoperative dose of 1g of tranexamic acid
      (TXA) versus a preoperative dose of 1g of TXA followed by a continuous infusion of 1g over
      height hours on blood loss.

      The purpose of this study is to compare a single preoperative dose of 1g of tranexamic acid
      (TXA) versus a preoperative dose of 1g of TXA followed by a continuous infusion of 1g over
      eight hours on blood loss. The efficacy of TXA on blood loss is greatly influenced by the
      timing of its administration relative to surgery. In total hip arthroplasty, TXA should be
      started before surgery. However the optimal duration of TXA administration in hip
      arthroplasty is unknown. Numerous studies have shown that a single preoperative
      administration of TXA is effective. Yet indirect comparisons indicate a higher efficacy of
      TXA started before surgery and followed with a continuous infusion or repeated boluses. Our
      hypothesis is that a single preoperative administration of TXA is not sufficient to maintain
      therapeutic concentrations of TXA in the postoperative period. In addition a
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study will be performed to identify the contribution of TXA
      plasma concentration as a predictor of blood loss.
