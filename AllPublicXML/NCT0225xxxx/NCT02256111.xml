    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of supervised exercise training on cardiopulmonary
      function in men receiving the combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) and androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) for treatment of non-metastatic, hormone-naïve prostate cancer. No study to
      date has examined the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of exercise training to prevent
      and/or mitigate common adverse toxicities in men receiving combination androgen suppression
      therapy for hormone-naïve prostate cancer.

    <measure>Change in the effect on metabolic outcome over time between the usual care and exercise training arms.</measure>

    <description>For analysis of metabolomics, i.e. fasting glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR and body composition (lean and fat body mass), PCA analysis will be used to reduce the large number of correlated factors into a smaller number of dimensions. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses will be done separately for the usual care and exercise groups. Of primary interest is the association of metabolomic biomarkers with changes in both VO2peak and HOMA-IR. Changes in metabolite concentrations and VO2peak or HOMA-IR will be compared between the usual care and exercise groups using ANOVA. Correlation analysis and linear regression will be used to describe the relationship between metabolomics biomarker changes and VO2peak or and HOMA-IR. Nominal statistical significance will be defined as p&lt;0.05.</description>
