      Assess the mycobactericidal activity of PA-824 (given at 200 mg daily) when added to
      first-line tuberculosis (TB) treatment (isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and a rifamycin antibiotic)
      over 12 weeks of treatment. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase IIB, 12-week, open-label, single-site, randomized clinical trial with three treatment
      groups. Patients with drug-sensitive TB will all receive once daily isoniazid and
      pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of daily isoniazid. In addition, Arm 1
      participants will receive PA-824 200 mg daily and rifampin 600 mg daily for 12 weeks. Arm 2
      participants will receive PA-824 200 mg daily and rifabutin 300 mg daily for 12 weeks. Arm 3
      participants (control group) will receive rifampin for 12 weeks and ethambutol for 8 weeks.
      Patients will be screened within 1 week of TB diagnosis, will receive 12 weeks of study
      treatment and will return for follow-up visits at 4, 12, and 36 weeks after study treatment
      completion. All patients will be referred to the local TB treatment program after completion
      of study treatment to finish their 24-week TB treatment course.

             suggesting resistance to rifampin)

         12. Laboratory parameters done at, or 14 days prior to, screening (with results available
             for review by study personnel) demonstrating any of the following:

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Serum total bilirubin level &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Serum creatinine greater than the upper limit of normal

               -  Hemoglobin level less than 7.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3
