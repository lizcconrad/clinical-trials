    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled, within subject comparison, multiple dose
      study to determine the sensitization potential of M518101 on normal skin under occlusive
      patch condition.

    <textblock>
      During the Induction Phase of the study, the study drugs and controls will be applied 9 times
      for 21 days on the infrascapular area of the back under occlusive patch conditions.

      Following induction, subjects will have a 10 to 14-day Rest phase, after which they will
      enter the challenge Phase, which consists of one 48-hour patch application (occlusive) to a
      na√Øve site on the opposite side of the back.
