             which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, or a disease which may influence the results of the study
             or the subject's ability to participate in the study)

             the administering of TPV/r or omeprazole

         10. Subject who have had an acute illness within 14 days prior to Visit 2

                  Study Day 1

               -  Are not willing to use a reliable method of double-barrier contraception during
                  the trial and for 30 days after completion or termination of the trial
