      Assess sensitivity and specificity of two nucleic acid amplification tests, namely Epistem
      Genedrive® and MolbioTruenat™ in raw sputum compared to the WHO-endorsed GeneXpert® MTB/RIF
      assay using a gold standard of four cultures
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Estimate the accuracy of the Epistem Genedrive® and MolbioTruenat™ in raw sputum and in
           sputum pellets.

        -  Assess the operational feasibility of Epistem Genedrive® and MolbioTruenat™

        -  Determine and compare costs between the Epistem Genedrive®, MolbioTruenat™, and Xpert

    <description>• Participants will be asked to provide a total of three sputum samples over Days 1 and 2. The intent is for all samples to be collected before the subject starts any form of TB treatment. The first specimen (S1) should be 2 ml or greater in volume, and the second and third specimens (S2 and S3) should each be 1 ml or greater in volume. On Day 1, each participant will be asked to submit one spot sputum (S1) after enrollment and a second spot sputum after at least 2 hours (S2). Participants will be instructed to come back the following day (Day 2) and provide a third spot sputum (S3). In the event that a participant fails to return on Day 2, S3 may be collected a maximum of 7 days after enrollment, provided that no TB treatment has been initiated.</description>

    <description>S1 will undergo direct smear and Epistem Genedrive® (optional for phase 2*) testing, before being homogenized with glass beads and split into three portions for testing with Epistem Genedrive®, MolBio Truenat™ and GeneXpert MTB/Rif® respectively. S2 and S3 will be randomized as to the order of testing using Epistem Genedrive® and MolBio Truenat™.</description>
