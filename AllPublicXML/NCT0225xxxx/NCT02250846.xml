      The purpose of this study is to determine whether EGFR-TKI can control the development of
      intracranial lesions in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer patients with asymptomatic brain
      metastases, and the difference in progression free survival between exon 19 and exon 21
      mutations.

      A open, positive control of phase II clinical trials, divided into selection period,
      treatment period and follow-up period , comply with the standard set of participants signed a
      written informed consent, according to different divided into 19 patients with EGFR mutations
      outside show son mutation group) and 21 extra show mutations, and according to the ECOG
      physical status, age, previous systemic treatments such as hierarchical analysis, regular
      follow-up and to assess efficacy, life care and safety.
