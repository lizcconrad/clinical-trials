  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ranolazine on different markers of
      cardiometabolic disease in women with stable angina and on angina frequency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the ability of ranolazine to favorably modify thrombogenic, inflammatory, lipogenic,
      oxidative stress and hormonal biomarkers in a relatively short period of time in a group of
      ethnically diverse women with chronic stable angina and metabolic syndrome. Evaluate the
      ability of ranolazine to favorably decrease angina frequency and nitroglycerine use in a
      relatively short time in this group of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  -Patients with chronic stable angina (&gt; 3 months) and symptomatic &gt;=3 attacks/week on
             evidence based adequate therapy

          -  Evidence of stable coronary artery disease by any of these:

          -  MI, PCI or CABG &gt; 30 days prior to enrollment or

          -  Angiography showing &gt; 50% stenosis in major vessel, branch or bypass graft &gt; 30 days
             of Enrollment or

          -  Abnormal stress MPI nuclear study, or DBA stress echo where the decision has been to
             treat medically and where angina has remained stable for &gt;= 3 months

          -  Evidence of the Metabolic Syndrome: As defined by ATP III criteria i.e 3/5 of
             following Abdominal circumference F &gt; 88 cm (35 in), M &gt; 102 cm (40 in)
             Hypertriglyceridemia ≥ 150 mg/dl HDL F &lt; 50 mg/dl M &lt; 40 mg/dl Blood Pressure ≥130/85
             Fasting Glucose ≥100 mg/dl For reproductive age women, a negative urine pregnancy test
             is required if all other inclusion criteria are met.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Exclusion of patients with contraindications to use of RANEXA, including patients on
             CYP3A4 inducers/potent inhibitors, and patients with liver cirrhosis.

          -  Exclusion of Patients with CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min

          -  Limit dose of RANEXA to 500mg BID in patients on concurrent diltiazem/verapamil

          -  Limit concurrent simvastatin to 20 mg/day

          -  Limit concurrent metformin to 1000 mg/day Additional Exclusion

          -  Patients with variable -inconsistent symptoms

          -  Patients with unstable coronary artery disease or revascularization within 30 days of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients who have known severe liver disease.

          -  Patients already receiving maximal ranolazine therapy for more than 4 weeks

          -  Presence of diabetes, hypothyroidism, active infection, cancer and/or recent major
             surgery or illness.

          -  Patients with any contraindication to ranolazine see above

          -  Women of reproductive age are excluded if they are planning to become pregnant in the
             next 6 -12 months after randomization.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Documented allergic reaction to ranolazine in the past.

          -  Unexplained prolongation of the QTc &gt; 500 milliseconds.

          -  Current or planned co-administration of moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg, diltiazem,
             verapamil, aprepitant, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or
             grapefruit-containing products) is not a full contraindication, if meet inclusion
             criteria otherwise, these patients could be accepted in trial but dose will be limited
             to 500 mg BID as stated previously.

          -  Current or planned co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole,
             itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and
             saquinavir) OR strong CYP3A inducers (eg, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin,carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort) is a contraindication.
