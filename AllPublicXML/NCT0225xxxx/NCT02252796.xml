  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help researchers test the safety of hypofractionated dose of radiotherapy
      (HySBst) at different dose levels before or after chemo-radiation for Non Small Cell Lung
      Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are assigned to Sub-group 1 or 2 based on the primary lesion size and location. This
      protocol will utilize a standard 3 + 3 phase I design with three patients enrolled per
      cohort.

      Patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the blood specimen component of
      the study.

      Patients will be followed up to 2 years post radiation therapy.

      Sub-group 1 will receive HySBst for 1 week. Weeks 2-7 will be standard chemo-radiation
      therapy. Patients have the option of consolidative chemotherapy at week 12.

      Sub-group 2 will receive standard chemo-radiation therapy for weeks 1-6 then receive HySBst
      during week 7. Patients have the option of consolidative chemotherapy at week 12.

      HySBst dose escalation for each sub-group is listed below:

      Optional: 4 Gy x 4 daily fractions Level 1: 5 Gy x 4 daily fractions Level 2: 5.5 Gy x 4
      daily fractions Level 3: 6 Gy x 4 daily fractions

      DLTs will be based on events occurring during the course of HySBst.

      Chemo-Radiation Therapy is defined as:

      Standard Carboplatin &amp; Paclitaxel Doublelet Regimen with weekly Carboplatin AUC 2/week and
      Paclitaxel 45 mg/ m2/ week during conventionally fractionated IMRT

      Image-guided IMRT to 60 Gy, 5 x per week for 6 weeks

      Consolidative chemotherapy is defined as Carboplatin AUC 6 and Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 every 21
      days x 2 cycles will be given after ALL radiotherapy is delivered.
