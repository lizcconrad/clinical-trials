  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the serologic and cell-mediated immune response to
      licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in
      children 5-17 years old. The effects of prior infection and or prior season vaccination will
      be examined. Children will be followed during the influenza season to identify
      laboratory-confirmed influenza (i.e. vaccine failure).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children will have baseline blood samples drawn and will then be vaccinated with licensed
      and approved influenza vaccines. Following the recommendation from the Advisory Committee on
      Immunization Practices, children 5-8 years old will preferentially receive live attenuated
      influenza vaccine (LAIV). Children aged 9-17 will be randomized to receive either LAIV or
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Children with a medical contraindication to any licensed
      influenza vaccine will be excluded from the study.

      The children will have their blood drawn between 2 and 4 times total over the course of two
      months in order to test their immune response to the vaccine. Between approximately December
      and April, study participants will be contacted weekly to monitor for any new respiratory
      illnesses with cough, and if present, nasal and throat swabs will be collected to test for
      influenza.
