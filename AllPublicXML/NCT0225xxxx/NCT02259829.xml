        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males and females according to the following criteria:

             Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs
             (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests

          2. Age ≥18 and Age ≤55 years

          3. BMI ≥18.5 and BMI ≤29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index)

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance

          2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             neurological disorders

          6. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          7. Chronic or relevant acute infections

          8. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients)

          9. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less
             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial
             except for oral contraceptives as well as ovary and thyroid hormone replacement

         10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial (especially
             unspecific inducing agents like St.John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or inhibitors
             like cimetidine) or that prolong the QT/corrected QT interval based on the knowledge
             at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during
             the trial

         11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to

             the trial)

         17. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the
             trial)

         18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

         19. Any history of relevant low blood pressure

         20. Supine blood pressure at screening of systolic &lt;110 mm Hg and diastolic &lt;60 mm Hg

         21. History of urticaria

         22. History of angioneurotic edema

         23. Fructose intolerance

             For female subjects:

         24. Pregnancy / positive pregnancy test, or planning to become pregnant during the study
             or within 1 month of study completion

         25. No adequate contraception during the study and until 1 month of study completion, i.e.
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, sexual
             abstinence (for at least 1 month prior to enrolment), vasectomised partner (vasectomy
             performed at least 1 year prior to enrolment), or surgical sterilisation (incl.
             hysterectomy). Females, who have not a vasectomised partner, are not sexually
             abstinent or surgically sterile will be asked to additionally use barrier
             contraception methods (e.g. condom, diaphragm with spermicide)
