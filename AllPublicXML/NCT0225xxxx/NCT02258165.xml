  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first prospective study enrolling consecutive patients with advanced
      ovarian cancer to determine the prevalence of thoracic and extra-abdominal involvement in
      this patient group and the relative value of gated PET and CT for diagnosing extra-abdominal
      involvement. This study will also answer a number of other stil unanswered questions: the
      impact of gating and the impact of gated PET on clinical management of patients with advanced
      ovarian cancer. This study also individualises patients' treatment to allow patients who may
      benefit most form optimal surgical cytoreduction and those who are better treated by
      neoadjuvant

      This study directly compares standard CT scanning with PET/CT scanning with gating (computer
      adjusted for breathing excursions) in patients with advanced EOC. The primary objective of
      this study is to obtain definitive evidence on the value of gated PET/CT compared to current
      standard imaging (CT scan) for the diagnosis of extra-abdominal and thoracic involvement.
      This study will give precise estimates on the sensitivity and specificity of CT compared with
      gated PET/CT, and allow calculation of the positive predictive value and negative predictive
      value. The proportion of patients upstaged to Stage IV (extra-abdominal involvement) from
      Stage III by gated PET/CT will be calculated.

      Secondary objectives are to establish:

        -  The impact of gated PET/CT images on clinical management (changes to planned treatment;
           detection of metastatic spread to &quot;unexpected&quot; sites).

        -  The validity of gated PET/CT positive (FDG avid) findings through histological
           evaluation.

        -  We will also receive information of &quot;unusual&quot; (unexpected) FDG positive metastatic
           lesions that would normally not noticed on CT scans.

      Current standard treatment for patients with advanced EOC is upfront surgery as long as all
      tumour is confined to the pelvis and the abdomen. Unfortunately, EOC is often found at
      distant sites where it was not suspected during surgery (which is too late). If the surgeon
      had had prior knowledge of this disease distribution, the surgeon would not have subjected
      the patient to a long and invasive surgical procedure. Instead they but would have referred
      the patient to upfront chemotherapy, which is widely accepted clinical practice throughout
      Australia.

      This study aims to increase the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative medical imaging and
      subject a larger group of patients with advanced EOC to accurate management.

    <description>PET/CT (without respiratory gating) is performed on an ad-hoc basis in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the lead up to surgery. The sensitivity of PET/CT for detecting low volume pleural disease is likely reduced by respiratory motion during the ten minute acquisition time over the chest. By &quot;freezing&quot; this respiratory motion with respiratory gating, we hope that gated PET/CT detection of pleural metastases will improve over non-gated PET images.</description>
