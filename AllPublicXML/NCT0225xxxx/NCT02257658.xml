  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate the feasibility of conducting a large, randomized trial
      comparing a structural intervention to contingency management to reduce incident syphilis
      infections in an especially high risk group: HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) who have
      had syphilis twice or more since their HIV diagnosis. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either QD doxycycline as syphilis prophylaxis or a financial incentive to remain STI free.
      The investigators will : 1) measure adherence to study visits in both arms; 2) measure
      adherence to the prophylaxis regimen; 3) measure any changes in risk behaviors among study
      participants and 4) to the extent possible in a small pilot study of short duration, compare
      effectiveness of doxycycline with that of a monetary incentive for remaining STI free.

    <time_frame>12 Weeks, 24 Weeks and 36 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At Weeks 12, 24 and 36, blood samples were drawn from participants in the Doxycycline arm and sent to a lab to measure doxycyline levels in each participant in the Doxycyline Arm. The purpose of this outcome is to determine if individuals in the Doxycycline Arm are consistently adhering to the daily regimen of the drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure changes in self-report sexual risk behaviors (e.g., condom use, drug use and number of partners) in the Doxycycline and Contingency Management Arms at Weeks 12, 24 and 36</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks, 24 Weeks and 36 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to having labs drawn, participants in both the Doxycycline and Contingency Management Arms were asked about their risk behaviors in the past three months including: meth use, condom use with casual partners, condom use with regular partners, condom use with a main partner, number of casual sexual partners and number of regular sexual partners.</description>
