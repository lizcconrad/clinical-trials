      1. To investigate the relative bioavailability (BA) of improved tablet formulation
           candidates to determine which formulation will be developed for use in late Phase II and
           Phase III clinical trials

        2. To investigate the relative BA of the pediatric suspension, compared to the current 1B
           formulation

        3. To investigate the bioequivalence (BE) of BILR 355 BS in two tablet strengths; three
           25mg tablets vs. one 75 mg tablet, current 1B formulation
