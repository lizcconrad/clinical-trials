  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of severe dyspnoea among terminally ill patients has been reported as 70% and
      90% for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, respectively.

      Current management to dyspnoea includes opioids, psychotropic drugs, inhaled frusemide,
      Heliox 28 and oxygen.

      Conventional oxygen supplementation is often used in these patients, but it may be
      inadequate, especially if they require high flows (from 30L/min to 120L/min in acute
      respiratory failure).

      High-flow oxygen nasal cannula (HFONC) is a new technological device in high-flow oxygen
      system that consists of an air-oxygen blender (allowing from 21% to 100% FiO2) which
      generates the gas flow rate up to 55 L/min and a heated humidification system. This
      technology may have an important role in reducing respiratory distress in do-not-intubate
      patients.

      Some HFONC's beneficial effects are the washout of the nasopharyngeal dead space reducing
      rebreathing of CO2 and improvement oxygenation through greater alveolar oxygen concentration;
      a better matching between patient's inspiratory demand and oxygen flow; generation of a
      certain level of positive pressure (PEEP) contributing to the pulmonary distending pressure
      and recruitment; improvement of lung and airway mucociliary clearance due to the heated and
      humidified oxygen; and patient's comfort because of the nasal interface allowing feeding and
      speech.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients supported with HFONC need less opioids to
      decrease dyspnoea.

    <description>Patient will use HFONC with FiO2 enough to achieve SpO2&gt;90%. If needed, morphine is titrated to reduce a patient's dyspnoea score by at least one point on the Borg scale and to achieve at least level 5 or less. Initial dose: 10 mg, repeated every 4h until the desired reduction in dyspnoea is obtained. In the case of refractory dyspnoea, the dose is increased by 50%.</description>
