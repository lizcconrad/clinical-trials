  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish normal Magnetic Resonance quantitative values
      (tissues stiffness, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient values and Blood Oxygen Level
      Determination values for both renal cortex and medullary tissues and total renal blood flow)
      for young Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease patients with normal renal function,
      and normal young adult controls without Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and
      normal renal function.

      Hypothesis: Newer Magnetic Resonance quantitative imaging parameters (tissue stiffness,
      Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, Blood Oxygen Level Determination levels, Magnetization
      Transfer and renal blood flow) will have different values in young adult ADPKD patients as
      compared to normal volunteers.

        Ten known ADPKD patients between the ages of 18-30, and 10 normal non-ADPKD volunteers
        between the ages of 18-30, who are MRI compatible will be studied. Study participants will
        be selected from a list queried from the Polycystic Kidney Disease database.
