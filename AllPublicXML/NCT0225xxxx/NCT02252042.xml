    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) versus standard treatment
      (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and
      neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of standard treatment. The primary study hypothesis is
      that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs overall survival when compared to standard treatment.
