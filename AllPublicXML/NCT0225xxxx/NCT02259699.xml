  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and test a new decision aid -named Patient Centered
      Outcome Aid (PCOA)-that will allow patients to assimilate information and identify trade-offs
      about the impact of IP/IV therapy versus IV-only therapy on their QOL and survival, based on
      their own preferences and personal clinical characteristics, described in terms that are
      meaningful to them. To accomplish this, the investigators will 1)develop the PCOA, a patient-
      and provider-friendly decision aid and 2)test the effectiveness of PCOA through a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT).

      The investigators hypothesize that PCOA will be significantly better than usual care,
      resulting in patients reporting more satisfaction with their treatment decision, less
      decision regret, better quality of life, and more satisfaction with their care compared with
      similar patients not having access to PCOA. If these hypotheses are substantiated, patients
      and providers will have an improved model for communication and decision making, leading to
      better patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage and carries the highest
      fatality-to-case ratio of all gynecologic malignancies diagnosed in the United States.
      Arguably the most effective treatment regimen to date is provided through intraperitoneal
      (IP) chemotherapy delivery, together with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, which in the most
      recent phase III randomized trial conferred the longest median survival (65.6 months) ever
      reported in advanced ovarian cancer, compared to 49.7 months in the IV-only treatment arm.
      However, during active treatment, patients randomized to the IP therapy group reported
      significantly worse quality of life (QOL), and more treatment-related toxicities. In short,
      women are less likely to die if they receive an IP component to their chemotherapy, a finding
      that was underscored by an NCI Clinical Alert. However, there may be greater toxicity with IP
      treatment. The tradeoff between short-term reduced QOL and longer survival is difficult for
      patients to understand and then incorporate meaningfully into their decision-making process.
      In fact, for reasons that are not entirely clear, many patients are not offered IP therapy.
      Patient-centered care requires that they be given the opportunity to participate in treatment
      decision-making.

    <measure>Satisfaction with Decision</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment and 1 year after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Decision scale (SWD) is a 6-item scale measuring satisfaction with health care decisions, developed and validated in the context of women making decisions about hormone replacement therapy, and subsequently validated in adults with depression making decisions about treatment. The scale has good internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.85), evidence of construct validity, relevance to designing and assessing patient-centered decision support interventions, and is sensitive to changes in information in trials of decision aids. The scale uses a 1-5 rating (1=strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with the decision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shared decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of interventions aimed at implementing shared decision-making. The 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) was developed and psychometrically tested for use in clinical encounters. It has strong reliability and validity, and use is advocated in studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at implementing shared decision-making. The question stem will indicate the medical decision (IP/IV) with 6 levels of agreement from 'completely disagree to completely agree' (e.g., &quot;My doctor and I selected a treatment option together&quot;). SDM will be assessed at T1 only, since this is most proximal in time to when the decision was made.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-O is a multidimensional QOL questionnaire developed and validated for use by ovarian cancer patients; it includes 3 subscales: Physical Well-Being (7 items), Functional; Well-Being (7-items) and Additional Ovarian Cancer Concerns (12-items).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with care and satisfaction with cancer treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Care will be measured using the EORTC IN-PATSAT32, assessing cancer patients' appraisal of doctors and nurses, as well as aspects of care organization and services. This measure has excellent internal consistency and convergent validity, although some scales are highly correlated. Test-retest reliability is acceptable. This measure and the QLQ-C30 (a quality of life measure) are not significantly correlated, suggesting that the two questionnaires are assessing distinct concepts. The measure also discriminates between cancer patients with different care expectations. Studies to assess responsiveness to change over time in structure and process of care are underway. Satisfaction with Cancer Treatment will be measured using the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire, which contains 21 items assessing seven domains, including satisfaction with cancer therapy. This has been validated on adults with many cancer types and treatments.</description>

    <description>Usability and acceptability of PCOA data will be gathered only from the intervention arm. The usability and acceptability of the PCOA program will be determined both through objective data gathered as patients use the application, and through subjective data gathered through a short, self-report survey that will appear on the PCOA application at the end of the session.</description>
