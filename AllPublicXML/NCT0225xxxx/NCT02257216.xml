          5. CGI-S ≥4 (moderately ill or worse).

          6. Subjects in ongoing psychotherapy will be allowed, but no significant changes in the
             frequency, type or intensity of the therapy are to be made during the course of their
             study participation per the discretion of the principal investigator. The subject must
             be in psychotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          2. Any underlying/ history or current diagnosis of systemic and/or metabolic disease
             (e.g. diabetes, Crohn's disease) and/or neurological condition state that may render
             the subject illegible to participate in the study as assessed by medical history,
             physical exam, clinical and lab evaluation.

          3. History of uncontrolled hypertension or a resting systolic blood pressure &gt; 140mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg (Subjects with well controlled hypertension on a

          9. Subjects taking any medication with CNS effects (excluding subjects who discontinue
             the medications at least 2 weeks prior to the study for stimulants and 4 weeks for
