    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the application of a citric acid +
      tetracycline gel solution during 90 or 180 seconds compared to no conditioning in the
      outcomes of treatment of Miller's class I or II recession defects by subepithelial connective
      tissue graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients showing Miller's class I or II recession defects requiring root coverage were
      recruited to participate in the study. All patients were submitted to non surgical
      periodontal therapy consisting of scaling and root planing, prophylaxis, and oral hygiene
      instruction in order to reduce/eliminate gingival inflammation. After that, patients were
      randomly allocated to three different treatment groups based on root conditioning: G0- no
      conditioning; G90- root conditioning for 90 seconds; G180- root conditioning for 180 seconds.
      Allocation was defined by a software. Root coverage was performed by subepithelial connective
      tissue graft (SCTG) in all treated sites by the same operator, who performed the indicated
      root treatment. Periodontal parameters were investigated at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12
      months post-operatively by a blinded trained expertise different from operator and included:
      pocket depth, recession height, clinical attachment level, width of keratinized gingiva,
      sulcular bleeding index and plaque index. Hypersensitivity at recession sites was also
      investigated at baseline and at 7 days, 14 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment
      according to visual analogic scale (VAS).
