  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether mild liver impairment affects blood levels of
      istradefylline in humans. Decreased liver function could possibly increase istradefylline
      levels.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel group, single-dose study to determine the
      single-dose PK of istradefylline in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (HI) (Child-Pugh
      Class A) and in subjects with normal hepatic function. Ten subjects with mild HI (Child-Pugh
      Class A) and 10 subjects with normal hepatic function (matched for age, gender, race, and
      BMI) will be enrolled. Enrollment of the subjects with normal hepatic function will be
      subsequent to the HI subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          -  Non-smoking males and females 18-75 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Men and women with procreative potential must practice medically reliable double
             barrier methods of birth control;

          -  Body mass index (BMI): 18.0-35.0 kg/m2, inclusive:

          -  Must abstain from drugs and nutrients known as moderate to potent inhibitors/inducers
             of CYP3A4 and CYP1A enzymes. These agents should be discontinued at least 4 weeks
             before the istradefylline dose (Day 1) until the Follow-up visit.

          -  Negative results at Screening and Baseline for the following screening laboratory
             tests: urine drug screen (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates,
             cannabinoids, and cocaine). Documented prescription use in subjects with mild HI for
             medications included in the urine drug of abuse test is permitted as long as the dose
             is stable for at least 2 weeks;

        Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function only

          -  Medical history without clinically significant or ongoing pathology, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator will preclude the subject's participation in, or influence
             the outcome of the study;

        Subjects with Mild Hepatic Impairment only

          -  Stable, mild liver disease (Child-Pugh A [5 to 6 points]); of cryptogenic,
             post-hepatic, hepatitis B/C virus, or alcoholic origin;

          -  Stable hepatic impairment, defined as no clinically significant change in disease
             status within the last 30 days, as documented by the subject's recent medical history;

        Additional inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are taking oral contraceptives or long-term injectable or
             implantable hormonal contraceptives, pregnant, lactating, or breast-feeding;

          -  Known history of treatment for drug or alcohol addiction within the previous 12 months
             or &gt; 14 untis of alcohol consumption per week, or alcohol consumption within 1 week
             prior to dosing;

          -  Positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or Hepatitis B surface
             antigen;

          -  Difficulty fasting or eating the standard meals that will be provided;

          -  Severe ascites at Screening;

          -  History of or current severe hepatic encephalopathy (Grade 3 or higher)

          -  Any of the following laboratory parameters at screening:

               1. Serum ALT &gt; 5 × the upper limit of normal range (ULN);

               2. Serum albumin &lt; 2.4 g/dL;

               3. Platelet count &lt; 80,000/mm3;

               4. Hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL;

               5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 × 109/L (&lt; 1.5 × 103/μL);

          -  Biliary liver cirrhosis or other causes of HI not related to parenchymal disorder
             and/or disease of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma.
