    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of benralizumab
      administration in asthma patients who have completed one of the three predecessor studies:
      D3250C00017, D3250C00018 or D3250C00020.

    <textblock>
      After a minimum of 1200 patients have been enrolled in this study, subsequent patients (up to
      a maximum of 2200 total for the study), who complete a minimum of 16 weeks, and no more than
      40 weeks, in this study, will be given the option to transition to an open-label safety
      extension study, Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI).

      Adolescent patients, patients from Japan and South Korea, and any patient who chooses not to
      enter Study D3250C00037 will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.

      At the time of the first interim analysis in Japanese patients, the study regimen for all
      patients will become unblinded to AstraZeneca for data analysis purposes. Study conduct and
      blinding at the site and patient level will remain unchanged.

             electrocardiogram (ECG), haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during a
             predecessor study which in the opinion of the investigator may put the patient at risk
             because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the
             study, or interfere with the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of the
             study

          4. Current malignancy or malignancy that developed during a predecessor study (subjects
             that had basal cell carcinoma, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which was
             resected for cure, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix that has been treated/cured will
             not be excluded).

          5. Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of treatment in
             this study, during the treatment period, and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after the
             last dose of the investigational product

          6. Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 30 days prior to Visit 1

          7. Planned major surgical procedures during the conduct of the study
