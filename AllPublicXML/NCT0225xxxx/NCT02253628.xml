    <textblock>
      This study investigated the acute effect of the consumption of four different kinds of coffee
      (hot and cold instant coffee, cold espresso and hot filter coffee) with the same caffeine
      content on salivary gastrin, cortisol and alpha-amylase concentrations, on self-reported
      gastrointestinal symptoms and on psychometric assessments in healthy individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coffee consumption is very common in Greece. Many of the consumers support that certain types
      of coffee and especially instant coffee cause gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy
      individuals. Up to now, few studies have investigated the relationship between coffee
      consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms and stress in healthy individuals with conflicting
      results.Coffee consumption is related with increased gastric acid and gastrin secretion,
      however it does not seem to affect stomach or stomach walls. Stress, which characterizes
      modern lifestyle, also is found to increase gastric acid and gastrin secretion and seems to
      be exclusively responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary gastrin and self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteers visited the lab after an 8-hour fasting. Saliva samples were taken at fasting for the determination of fasting salivary gastrin. After the consumption of coffee, saliva samples were taken at 15, 30, 60' for the determination of gastrin. Saliva samples were collected by the method &quot;Salivette&quot;. Saliva was carried out by chewing a swab for about 1 minute. Then, the swab was returned to the Salivette and the container was centrifuged and saliva sample was obtained. The samples were stored at - 20 degrees of Celsius. Gastrin was determined by an immunoenzymatic method. In order to record the effects of coffee consumption on gastrointestinal symptoms, the participants completed a visual analogue scale every time saliva samples were collected (time 0', 15', 30', 60', 120', 180'). The visual analogue scale (1 = not at all to 10 = very) included 12 questions about gastrointestinal symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure, energy intake and physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The aim was to investigate if blood pressure, energy intake and physical activity changed during the intervention. Blood pressure was measured three times in a sitting position after 15 minutes of rest by a mercury sphygmomanometer at the beginning and ending of each trial respectively. There was a 2-minute interval between measurements. Then, the average blood pressure measurements were calculated. Dietary intake was analyzed by Diet Analysis Plus (version 6.1). The database was extensively modified to include new foods and recipes. Physical activity was estimated by using metabolic equivalents of different activities performed by the volunteers the previous 7 days. Then, mean daily energy expenditure was estimated.</description>

    <measure>Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteers visited the lab after an 8-hour fasting. Saliva samples were taken at fasting for the determination of fasting salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase. After the consumption of coffee, saliva samples were taken at 15, 30, 60' for the determination of alpha-amylase and at 60, 120, 180' for cortisol determination.Saliva samples were collected by the method &quot;Salivette&quot;. Saliva was carried out by chewing a swab for about 1 minute. Then, the swab was returned to the Salivette and the container was centrifuged and saliva sample was obtained. The samples were stored at - 20 degrees of Celsius. Cortisol was determined by an immunoenzymatic method. Alpha-amylase was determined by a kinetic enzyme assay kit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported sentiments, mood and stress.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to record the effects of coffee consumption on stress and on sentiments and mood the participants completed the Zung self-assessment anxiety scale and a visual analogue scale every time saliva samples were collected (time 0', 15', 30', 60', 120', 180'). The Zung self-assessment anxiety scale included 20 questions, which were designed to assess how the volunteers felt the moment completing the questionnaire. The visual analogue scale (1 = not at all to 10 = very) included 17 questions about stress, sentiments and mood.</description>
