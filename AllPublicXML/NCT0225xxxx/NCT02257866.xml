      Background:

      - Vasculitis is a group of diseases that inflame and damage blood vessels and tissue. It can
      cause many medical problems. Few tests can diagnose the disease, and none can reliably
      predict a relapse. Researchers want to study people s genes and follow people over time to
      see how the disease affects them.

      Objective:

      - To learn the signs, symptoms, imaging tests, genetic markers, and blood tests that can help
      identify people with vasculitis and predict what will happen to them over time.

      Eligibility:

        -  People age 5 and older who have or are thought to have vasculitis, or are related to
           someone with it.

        -  Healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be evaluated by a doctor who has expertise caring for patients with
           vasculitis.

        -  Participants will give a blood sample. Some will give a urine sample.

        -  Some participants may have brushings or biopsies taken from the inside lining of the
           nose.

        -  Images of participants blood vessels may be taken using scans. For some scans,
           participants will lie on a table that moves in and out of a cylinder that takes
           pictures. For some scans, a contrast agent may be injected into an arm vein. Other scans
           may use a radioactive form of sugar. Healthy minors will not have scans.

        -  Some participants will answer questionnaires. - Some participants will have their tests
           done at NIH. Others will have their doctor take the blood, saliva, or cheek swab samples
           and send them to NIH.

        -  Some participants will have one visit lasting 1 2 (but sometimes up to 4) days. Some
           participants may have follow-up visits every 3 6 months, indefinitely.

      The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of idiopathic systemic
      vasculitis in children and adults. The idiopathic vasculitides are a group of rare, systemic
      diseases involving inflammation of arteries and other tissue with resulting organ- and
      lifethreatening disease courses. The different forms of idiopathic vasculitis are typically
      classified based upon the predominant size of the arteries affected in each condition,
      including small vessel vasculitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, Wegener s),
      microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA,
      Churg-Strauss)]; medium vessel vasculitis [polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)]; and large vessel
      vasculitis [giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu s arteritis (TAK), idiopathic aortitis
      (IA)], or

      variable sized vessel vasculitis [relapsing polychondritis (RP), Behcet s disease (BD).
      Although patients with each type of vasculitis manifest disease-specific aspects of illness,
      there are substantial disease and treatment burdens common to patients with vasculitis. For
      each type of idiopathic vasculitis, the disease course is often chronic, relapse is common
      and unpredictable, organ and tissue damage can accrue over time, new symptoms can occur late
      into the disease course, and treatment is often associated with toxicity and serious side
      effects.

      The goals of this natural history protocol are to establish a cohort of pediatric and adult
      patients with vasculitis to prospectively evaluate the signs and symptoms, imaging findings,
      and blood and tissue biomarkers associated with pathogenesis and disease outcomes. In the
      small vessel vasculitides, where considerable progress has been made towards identifying
      pathologic mechanisms of disease, we will focus on elucidating the pathogenic role of
      neutrophils, selected biomarkers such as SERPINA1, and novel candidate biomarkers in
      circulating blood and at local tissue sites including the nasal mucosa. In the medium and
      large vessel vasculitides, we will identify novel candidate biomarkers for disease
      pathogenesis and outcomes and develop disease activity indices that incorporate existing and
      novel clinical, laboratory, genomic, and imaging biomarkers. For all types of vasculitis, a
      goal of the protocol is to identify patients for possible entry into future

      treatment studies.

      Patients enrolled in this protocol will undergo a history, physical examination, and
      laboratory evaluation. Since vasculitis is multi-system disease with variable patterns of
      organ involvement, patients may undergo further comprehensive evaluation of a particular
      affected organ system when clinically indicated. Peripheral blood samples will be collected
      from affected patients, unrelated healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and ethnicity
      whenever possible, and in some cases unaffected family members to help identify and study the
      genes involved in vasculitis and their functions. We may ask some patients to undergo nasal
      biopsy and additional imaging studies for research purposes. For a small number of patients
      and family members, we may ask permission to perform whole genome or exome sequencing.
      Successful completion of these studies will improve our understanding of disease
      pathogenesis.
