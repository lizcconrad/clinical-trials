  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess through surface electromyography, the effectiveness of
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation protocols in the activation of the stabilizing
      muscles of the scapula and the anterior tibial muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects and subjects with demyelinating polyneuropathy are involved in the study.

      Healthy patients are arranged in two groups of stimulation: FNP Group (intervention
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) - CC Group (intervention classic cinesioterapia).
      The electromyographic response of the stabilizing muscles of the scapula of each individual
      will be assessed prior to application of the protocols, during the execution of the protocols
      and immediately after stopping in a single session.

      Patients with demyelinating polyneuropathy are arranged in a single treatment group and will
      be treated at a frequency of twice a week for five weeks. In each session, the PNF patterns
      will be repeated four times, on both sides, stimulating muscle irradiation and evoking the
      contraction of the tibialis anterior muscle. During the repetition of the patterns, the
      dorsiflexor muscle response of each patient will be obtained by an electromyography (EMG)
      surface.

      The data of the RMS values obtained in the first session will be normalized and transformed
      into percentage. The average RMS of each diagonal at the beginning of treatment corresponds
      to 100% of TA muscle activation. The RMS values obtained in the last session will be
      normalized as a percentage, taking into account the results of the first evaluation. After
      normalization, data from the first and last sessions will besubjected to the for paired
      t-test.
