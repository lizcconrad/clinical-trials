  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and
      potential for drug-drug interaction of arhalofenate when combined with febuxostat in adult
      population with gout.

      Patients entering the six-week Treatment Period will receive once daily oral dosing of
      arhalofenate during Weeks 1 and 2 (Days 1 through 14), combined once daily oral dosing of
      arhalofenate and febuxostat during Weeks 3 and 4 (Days 15 through 28), and once daily oral
      dosing of febuxostat during Weeks 5 and 6 (Days 29 through 42). In addition, all patients
      will receive once daily oral dosing of colchicine throughout the Treatment Period.

             during study participation

          -  Expected to be able to tolerate a short course of oral NSAIDs and/or oral steroids as

          -  History of stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, congestive
             heart failure (NYHA class II - IV), angina pectoris, coronary intervention procedure,

             thiazolidinediones (e.g., rosiglitazone or pioglitazone), desipramine, atypical
             antipsychotic agents, loop diuretics, warfarin, or phenytoin

          -  Chronic treatment with NSAIDs that cannot be safely discontinued-term use of NSAIDs is
             permitted, e.g., when used to treat gout flares
