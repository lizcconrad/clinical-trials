  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the efficacy and safety of nab-Paclitaxel in a Phase II
      trial of patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinomas of the stomach and
      gastro-esophageal junction

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinomas of the stomach or gastrointestinal junction refractory/resistant to 1st line
      chemotherapy are considered as an orphan disease with limited (if any) treatment options. The
      promising results of Nab-Paclitaxel derived from preclinical studies and from clinical trials
      conducted in breast cancer patients open the field to develop such therapeutic approaches in
      other cancers types usually treated with taxanes such as gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas. We
      design a phase II study in order to evaluate the effect of nab-Paclitaxel as salvage
      treatment for patients with advanced cancer of the stomach and GEJ previously treated with
      the DCF regimen.
