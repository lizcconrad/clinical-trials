      The aim of this study is to assess interobserver and intraobserver variability of the
      Amsterdam Stool Scale in clinical practice. After passing a stool by the child participating
      in the study it will be assessed using the Amsterdam Stool Scale independently by one of the
      parents and the medical doctor. At the same time a parent will take 2 photos that will be
      independently evaluated by another doctor.

      INTRODUCTION:

      Description of stool appearance is important in clinical practice. Parents are often asked to
      evaluate stool of their child. At present parents also take more frequently photos using
      smartphone camera when they are concerned with child's stool appearance and show it to their
      doctors. To make stool evaluation easier there have been stool form scales created. One of
      this is Amsterdam Stool Scale that enables stool assessment of children who are not yet
      toilet trained. This scale facilitates to describe amount, consistency and color of the
      stool.

      AIM:

      To assess interobserver and intraobserver variability of the Amsterdam Stool Scale in
      clinical practice.

      METHODS:

      After passing a stool by the child participating in the study, within a short-time interval
      (&lt;5 min), the stool will be assessed independently by one of the parents and the medical
      doctor. At the same time a parent will take 2 photos with phone camera. The photographs then
      will be independently evaluated by another doctor who will be unaware of both the &quot;in vivo&quot;
      stool appraisal and child condition.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

      Then the interobserver (between a parent, the doctor and the doctor assessing photograph)
      variability will be evaluated by calculating the kappa (κ) statistics for nominal data for
      the stool consistency, amount and color separately.

    <description>The outcome measures were interrater variability in the stool assessment by the parent and MD1 made in vivo and in the assessment by the parent in vivo and by MD2 based on the photograph(s). The IV was evaluated by calculating the proportion of exact agreement and the κ statistics for nominal data (colour) and weighted κ values for items in which there is a natural ordering of categories (consistency and amount). Correlation, based on the value of kappa (κ), was categorized as poor (κ ≤ 0.2), fair (0.21 ≤ κ ≤ 0.40), moderate (0.41 ≤ κ ≤ 0.60), good (0.61 ≤ κ ≤ 0.80) or excellent (0.81 ≤ κ ≤ 1.00).</description>
