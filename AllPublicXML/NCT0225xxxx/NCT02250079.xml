      INTRODUCTION: Hypothermia in the newborn causes morbid conditions. In developing countries in
      the basic technology for neonatal adaptation may not be available. Polyethylene bags may be
      an alternative to lamp radiant heat to prevent hypothermia OBJECTIVE: To characterize the
      differences between babies undergoing body bag with polyethylene or conventional drying
      during neonatal adaptation in the Hospital de la Victoria and Hospital de Engativ치, Bogot치,
      Colombia, 2013.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Groups: dried conventional
      (control) or polyethylene body bag (intervention). The procedure lasted 10 minutes, the bag
      body and / or radiant heat lamp was removed. Environment temperature and humidity,
      temperature in the body segments 1-5-10-60-120 minutes and APGAR was measured. Statistical
      Analysis: Descriptive bivariate statistical inference and calculated. Risk ratio (RR) and
      confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using contingency tables for risk analysis of the
      outcome. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee of victory.

    <description>The intervention group infants were provided the same care as control infants, but were dressed with the polyethylene body bag immediately after birth. The bag had an upper opening for the head and a seal at the bottom. The intervention group infants remained in the plastic bag for the first 10 minutes after birth. The same process was done in surgery room in case of cesarean. Umbilical prophylaxis, vitamin K1 application, initial physical examination and ocular prophylaxis are performed. The infants were swaddled in blankets provided by the mother, the head was covered with a hat, and the infants were placed either in an open crib or under a radiant warmer as necessary and available. The same process were done in surgery room in case of cesarean</description>

    <description>): Infants randomized to the control group received standard hospital care newborn. This included immediate drying, skin-to-skin contact, early and exclusive breast feeding, postponed bathing, bundling, and radiant warmer. While waiting for criteria cord clamping, the environment humidity and temperature and segment and rectal temperature of the newborn were measure. It was repeated at 1-5- 10-60 and 120 minutes. After clamping, the newborn were positioned in a radiant warmer, and completed the drying process. Umbilical prophylaxis, vitamin K1 application, initial physical examination and ocular prophylaxis are performed. The infants were swaddled in blankets provided by the mother, the head was covered with a hat, and the infants were placed either in an open crib or under a radiant warmer as necessary and available. The same process was done in surgery room in case of cesarean.</description>
