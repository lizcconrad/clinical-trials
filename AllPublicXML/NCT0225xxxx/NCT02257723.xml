      This study investigates the effect of hospital-based intensive non-surgical treatment in
      musculoskeletal patients admitted to an integrated hospital that offers both complementary
      and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine treatment.

      Inpatients received treatment according to a CAM treatment protocol (herbal medicine,
      acupuncture, bee venom pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manipulation) and conventional medicine
      treatment as needed. The main outcome measures were the duration of pain, NRS of back pain,
      radiating leg pain, neck pain, radiating arm pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, previous
      surgery, previous interventions (injections), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Vernon-Mior
      Neck Disability Index, the Korean Western Ontario McMaster Index, Shoulder Pain and
      Disability Index, range of motion (ROM), Straight leg raise test (SLR), alcohol use, smoking,
      exercise at admission, 2 weeks, and discharge.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NRS of low back pain (LBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to quantify their current LBP, setting no pain as 0 and the most severe pain that they could possibly imagine as 10.</description>

    <measure>NRS of radiating leg pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to quantify their current neck pain, setting no pain as 0 and the most severe pain that they could possibly imagine as 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NRS of radiating arm pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to quantify their current radiating arm pain, setting no pain as 0 and the most severe pain that they could possibly imagine as 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NRS of knee pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to quantify their current knee pain, setting no pain as 0 and the most severe pain that they could possibly imagine as 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NRS of shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to quantify their current shoulder pain, setting no pain as 0 and the most severe pain that they could possibly imagine as 10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry disability index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), 2 weeks, Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a survey assessing the patients' degree of functional disability in daily life consisting of 10 questions with 6 choices each corresponding to 0-5 points. The scores for each item are added, divided by 50, then multiplied by 100 to calculate the degree of disability. The Korean version of the ODI of which the reliability and validity have been verified through the research of Jeon et al. was used in this study.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Pharmacopuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Select ingredients similar to those included in the oral herbal medicine (Ostericum koreanum, Eucommia ulmoides, Acanthopanax Sessiliflorus, Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Peucedanum japonicum, Cibotium barometz, Lycium chinense, Boschniakia rossica, Cuscuta chinensis, and Atractylodes japonica) were freeze dried into powder form after decoction, then diluted in normal saline and adjusted for acidity and pH to be used in injections. The pharmacopuncture injections were injected once daily to the amount of 1 cc and Ah-shi points and local acupuncture points (CPL, 1 cc, 26G x 1.5 syringe, Shinchang medical co., Korea).</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Bee venom pharmacopuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Bee venom pharmacopuncture was applied after confirming a negative reaction to the hypersensitivity skin test. Diluted bee venom (saline:bee venom ratio, 10,000:1) was injected at 4-5 acupoints at the physician's discretion. Each acupuncture point was injected with approximately 0.2 cc to a total of 0.5-1 cc using disposable injection needles (CPL, 1 cc, 26G x 1.5 syringe, Shinchang medical co., Korea).</description>

    <intervention_name>Chuna manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Chuna was administered 3-5 times a week. Chuna is a Korean version of spinal manipulation that incorporates conventional spinal manipulation techniques for mobilization involving high-velocity, low amplitude thrusts to joints slightly beyond the passive range of motion and gentle force to joints within the passive range of movement.</description>
