    <textblock>
      This proposal describes a combined laboratory and clinical trial preliminary investigation to
      advance medication development for cocaine dependence. The main objective is to test whether
      intranasal Oxytocin could reduce relapse risk by reducing stress sensitivity. To measure the
      stress sensitivity, this study will evaluate a new stress challenge: a) Intranasal
      desmopressin, a vasopressin analog, will be used an endocrine stressor; its effects will be
      evaluated by serial measurements of serum Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and self
      reports; b) if pretreatment with intranasal oxytocin dampens the ACTH and subjective response
      to intranasal desmopressin. These measures will be tested during a 7-day inpatient abstinence
      induction hospitalization. For those patients with family and work obligations, an outpatient
      abstinence induction procedure is available. The response to the desmopressin challenge will
      be compared to a cohort of matched control subjects. After abstinence induction, cocaine
      dependent patients enter a 6-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 24
      IU of intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo, to monitor if this reduces the relapse risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the findings that chronic stress, caused in these patients by cocaine
      dependence, increases the sensitivity of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and CNS
      stress pathways to vasopressin. For their part, oxytocin systems, in chronic stress, acquire
      an increasing moderating effect on CNS stress system and the HPA axis. Cocaine dependence
      generates increased responsivity of stress system to oxytocin in the face of depleted
      oxytocin stores; thus creating an environment where exogenous oxytocin could exert a strong
      regulatory effect. Intranasal administration provides a convenient method to deliver these
      small peptides to the brain. Studying the feasibility of this approach, and its applicability
      to the treatment of cocaine-dependent patients, will be a goal of the study. The main outcome
      of this study will be the number of consecutive days of abstinence from cocaine after
      abstinence induction. A secondary outcome will be: Is the acute effect of intranasal oxytocin
      on desmopressin-induced ACTH secretion associated with the number of days of continued
      abstinence.

    <description>ACTH levels will be measured in serum samples. These are collected during phase 1, during which abstinence from cocaine is induced. These samples are collected to test the following hypothesis: Is greater ACTH secretion from intranasal desmopressin a predictor of a better effect of intranasal oxytocin on reducing cocaine use? In addition to serum ACTH samples, participants will be asked to fill out scales assessing their levels of stress, agitation, anxiety. The data collected from cocaine-dependent patients will be compared to non-addicted individuals. Cocaine-dependent patients repeat this endocrine test in phase 3, after they have received 6 weeks of intranasal oxytocin or placebo</description>
