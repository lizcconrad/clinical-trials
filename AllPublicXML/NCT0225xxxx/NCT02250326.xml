  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      second/third-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel in combination with the epigenetic modifying
      therapy of CC-486 or immunotherapy of durvalumab, and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in subjects
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will test the hypothesis that epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486 or
      immunotherapy of durvalumab can improve the anti-tumor activity of nab-paclitaxel in subjects
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received no more than one prior
      chemotherapy regimen for their advanced disease. It will further assess efficacy and safety
      of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in this setting. Each subject will receive study therapy as
      second- or third-line of treatment. Approximately 240 male and female subjects with advanced
      NSCLC will be assigned to one of the following treatment arms (approximately 80 subjects per
      group): nab-paclitaxel /CC-486 combination therapy, nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination
      therapy or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior to receiving first dose of Investigational
      Product. A permuted-block randomization method will be employed to assign the subjects among
      the treatment arms that are enrolling simultaneously, when applicable, stratified by the
      following baseline factors: ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), gender (males versus
      females), and smoker (yes versus no). Treatment assignments of subjects to the
      nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be
      conducted completely in a randomized fashion.

    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the efficacy of each of the three treatments as second/third-line in NSCLC. Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of randomization/treatment assignment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) on or prior to the data cutoff date for analyses, whichever occurred first, based on the investigator's assessment of the data from CT scans using RECIST 1.1 guidelines. To explore the effect of treatment post initial progression, PFS defined by irRECIST criteria may be estimated for the subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm. Baseline tumor measurements will be determined from the radiologic evaluation performed within 28 days before the start of study therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>The safety/tolerability of the two treatment arms will be monitored through continuous reporting and evaluated by adverse events and serious adverse events, and incidence of subjects experiencing dose modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of investigative product (IP). An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate is defined as the percent of subjects who have a radiologic complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, and irRECIST where applicable, as determined by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time between randomization and death. All deaths, regardless of the cause of death, will be included. All subjects who are lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study or who are withdrawn from the study will be censored at the time of last contact. Subjects who are still receiving treatment as of the data cutoff date will be censored at the cutoff date. Overall survival will be analyzed in a similar model as that for PFS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discontinuation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number and the percentage of subjects who discontinue study treatment will be presented based on the number of subjects who randomized into the study. Reasons for treatment discontinuation will be summarized for all subjects who discontinue study treatment during the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median dose intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>The dose intensity during the treatment period will be calculated separately for nab-Paclitaxel, CC-486 and durvalumab as the cumulative dose divided by the treatment duration in weeks. The descriptive statistics will be provided for the dose intensity by drug based on the treated population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of dose reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dose reduction is defined as when the dose administered after Cycle 1 Day 1 is at a lower dose level than the dose the subject receives at the previous dosing visit. Number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 dose reduction, number of dose reductions, and reasons for reduction, by cycle and overall will be summarized separately for nab-Paclitaxel, CC-486 and durvalumab.</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival for combination treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate the relative efficacy of each of the combination therapy arms to the monotherapy arm: The Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be estimated by the hazard ratio (HR) and the associated two-sided 95% CIs using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model. To explore the effect of treatment post initial progression, PFS defined by irRECIST criteria may be estimated for the subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm.</description>
