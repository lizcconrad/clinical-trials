      ARATA is a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter, observational study in Germany to
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of subcutaneously administered
      tocilizumab in participants with rheumatoid arthritis in daily clinical practice.
      Participants will be followed over an observation period of up to 2 years after the initial
      injection.
