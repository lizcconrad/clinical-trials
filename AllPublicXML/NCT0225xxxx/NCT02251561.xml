    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare an investigational contact lens care product (FID
      109182) to a commercially available contact lens product (Opti-Free Plus®) for corneal
      staining when used with Acuvue® Oasys® contact lenses. The contact lenses will be pre-soaked
      in the products for 24-48 hours prior to a 2-hour contralateral wear period.

    <description>The contact lens was removed, the cornea was stained with fluorescein (ophthalmic dye), and pictures of the corneal surface were taken. Corneal staining density was evaluated for each eye individually against representative pictures and scored on a 0-3 scale (0=No staining; 1=Staining with low density; 2=Staining with moderate density; 3=Staining with severe density). Proportion of participants is reported as a percentage.</description>

    <description>The contact lens was removed, the cornea was stained with fluorescein (ophthalmic dye), and pictures of the corneal surface were taken. Corneal staining area was evaluated for each eye individually against representative pictures and scored on a 0-3 scale [0=No staining; 1=Staining with small area (1 to 25% of corneal surface); 2=Staining with medium area (26 to 50% of corneal surface); 3=Staining with large area (51% of corneal surface or greater)].
