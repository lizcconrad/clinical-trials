    <textblock>
      Individuals with diabetes often report that difficult thoughts and feelings about diabetes
      interfere with making healthy choices with regards to diabetes management. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate a diabetes self-management group based on Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT). ACT is a new behavior therapy that has been found to be useful in treating
      psychological and behavioral difficulties. We are interested in whether individuals with
      diabetes will like an ACT-based diabetes management group and whether they find the group
      helpful.

      The goal of the current study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of an
      acceptance-based group to improve diabetes self-management among individuals with Type 1
      Diabetes. Interested individuals will participate in a weekly acceptance-based therapy group
      focusing on improving diabetes management (e.g., adherence to dietary recommendations,
      appropriate insulin dosing) for a total of 8 weeks. Participants will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires both pre and post treatment. Questionnaires will assess diabetes
      management and acceptability of the group (post treatment only). Regular medical monitoring
      is required for participation in the current study. Participants will be asked to provide
      consent to contact their current medical provider in order to confirm that the participant's
      is receiving regular medical monitoring for diabetes care and that providers are aware of
      their patient's participation in group.

    <description>The group sessions will be lead by a clinician trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and will meet at Duke Medical Center for 1 Â½ hours once a week for a total of 8 weeks. During group sessions, participants will identify how avoidance of difficult thoughts and feelings about diabetes has interfered with diabetes management and learn alternative ways of coping with these experiences. The group sessions are intended to supplement regular medical treatment; thus it is important that subjects continue to have diabetes symptoms monitored by their current treatment provider.</description>
