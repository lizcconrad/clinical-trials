  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was evaluate that there is no clinically relevant interaction
      between amitriptyline (or its metabolite nortriptyline) and BIRT 2584 XX (or its metabolite
      BI 610100) when BIRT 2584 XX is administered as a tablet formulation to near steady state in
      an estimated high therapeutic dose. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of amitriptyline and nortriptyline
      were measured before dosing of BIRT 2584 XX, after the first dose of BIRT 2584 XX, and after
      repeated doses of BIRT 2584 XX near steady state
