  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of single-agent pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with recurrent and/or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have progressed on
      platinum-based and cetuximab therapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will
      provide a clinically meaningful objective response rate (ORR).

      With protocol amendment 04 (30-Nov-2017), once study participants have achieved the study
      objective or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and
      enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was assessed by RECIST 1.1 by performing study imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of study treatment. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR) defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm) or Partial Response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference.</description>

    <description>Participants with a strong PD L-1 expression status were evaluated for ORR by RECIST 1.1. The expression of PD L-1 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and strong PD-L1 positive was defined as a PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥50% by IHC. ORR was assessed by performing study imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of study treatment. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a CR defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm) or PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to last dose of treatment plus 2 months of follow-up, up to 27 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, was another important medical event.</description>

        <title>ORR by RECIST 1.1 in PD-L1-Positive Participants</title>
        <description>Participants with a positive PD L-1 expression status were evaluated for ORR by RECIST 1.1. The expression of PD L-1 was determined by IHC and PD-L1 positive was defined as a PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥1% by IHC. ORR was assessed by performing study imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of study treatment. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a CR defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm) or PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference.</description>

        <description>Participants with a positive PD L-1 expression status were evaluated for DOR based on RECIST 1.1. The expression of PD L-1 was determined by IHC and PD-L1 positive was defined as a PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥1% by IHC. DOR was measured from the time measurement criteria were first met for CR/PR (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD was objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study). DOR was censored at the last tumor assessment date if a responder did not have PD or death. Non-responders were not included in the analysis. The lower and upper limits were estimated at the time of data cutoff. DOR was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and reported in months.</description>

        <description>Participants with a strong PD L-1 expression status were evaluated for OS. The expression of PD L-1 was determined by IHC and strong PD-L1 positive was defined as a PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥50% by IHC. OS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to death due to any cause. OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and reported in months.</description>
