  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cervical neoplasia in Cambodia is not known. There are no screening
      programs in place. The investigators plan on introducing a screening program based on WHO
      criteria and utilizing visualization with acetic acid. Patients who are positive will be
      offered same-day cryotherapy if indicated or will be referred for biopsy, LEEP and
      hysterectomy as indicated. The planned patient pool for this study is 1000 women, half of
      whom will be HIV positive (and thus have a presumed higher incidence of cervical neoplasia).
