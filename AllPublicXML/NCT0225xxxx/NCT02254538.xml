             study

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial up to 7 days prior to
             enrolment in the study or during the study

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (≤ two months prior to
             administration or during the trial)

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars of &gt; 3 pipes/day)
