  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are naturally-abundant isotopes in exhaled breath carbon dioxide. The
      ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in exhaled breath is known as the breath delta value. This
      study is seeking to determine if the breath delta value of adults with trauma is an early
      indicator of the onset of infection that may lead to sepsis.

    <textblock>
      Breath delta value is hypothesized to be a biomarker of infection. Breath delta value is not
      a defined clinical outcome related to human health, because this study is seeking to
      establish breath delta value as a biomarker of infection. This study is measuring the
      feasibility of the Isomark Canary™ device. If the Canary doesn't detect a significant
      decrease in breath delta value in those subjects who subsequently get an infection, it will
      not be feasible to use it for this purpose.

      Breath delta value will be collected to determine its relationship to infection, no health
      outcomes are being measured.

      In this single-center study of 110 subjects, breath samples will be collected 6 times per day
      and blood samples will be collected once per day for 7 days. Subjects will be followed for an
      additional 3 days. Analysis results of these samples will be combined with data that is
      abstracted from the subjects' medical records. The investigators hypothesize that the
      measurement of 13C/12C delta value in the exhaled breath of adults is an early indicator of
      infection in subjects with systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary to trauma.
