        Pregnant women aged 18 years or older within the US who were immunized with the Flucelvax
        vaccine at any time during pregnancy.The registry will allow eligible pregnant women to
        selfenroll and also allow HCPs to report de-identified data on pregnancy exposures and
        outcomes

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy women pregnant women aged 18 years or older within the US who were immunized
             with the Flucelvax vaccine at any time during pregnancy.The registry will allow
             eligible pregnant women to selfenroll and also allow HCPs to report de-identified data
             on pregnancy exposures and outcomes.

          -  Sufficient evidence to confirm that Flucelvax exposure occurred during pregnancy

          -  Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is prospectively or
             retrospectively registered (ie, whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the time
             of first contact with the registry)

          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is registered

          -  Full reporter (ie, HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up (name, address,etc)
             The primary population for analysis will include prospectively enrolled pregnancies
             exposed to Flucelvax that are not lost to follow-up (ie, with outcome information that
             meet the minimum criteria for evaluation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Invalid registry reports and pregnancies deemed lost to follow-up will be excluded
             from the primary analysis. Retrospective reports will not be included, although
             retrospective cases with MCMs will be reviewed and reported separately.
