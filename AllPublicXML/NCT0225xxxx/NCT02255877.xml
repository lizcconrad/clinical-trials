      Study designed to evaluate the Zip Surgical Skin Closure device versus conventional steel
      staple placement when utilized for surgical wound closure after bi lateral unicompartmental
      or bi later total knee replacement.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, within patient control study aiming to enroll up to 25 subjects
      requiring bi lateral knee arthroplasty (unicompartmental or toal) at a single study center.
      Subjects will be followed for up for 6 weeks post surgery to evaluate wound healing and
      overall satisfaction of closure methods.
