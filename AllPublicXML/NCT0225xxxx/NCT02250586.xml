  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: About 2.3 % of the adult population in Sweden is considered to be problem
      gamblers, and it is estimated that only 5 % of them seek treatment. Problem gambling can have
      devastating effects on the economy, health and relationship, both for the problem gambler and
      their concerned significant other (CSO). No empirically supported program exists for the CSOs
      of problem gamblers. Consequently, the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a program
      aimed at CSOs of treatment refusing problem gamblers. The program will be based on principles
      from cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. In order to benefit as many
      CSOs as possible, the program will be delivered via the Internet with therapist support via
      email and telephone.

      METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a randomized wait-list controlled internet-delivered trial. A
      cognitive behavioral-therapy program for the concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem
      gamblers (PGs) will be developed and evaluated. The participants will work through 8 modules
      over 10 weeks in a secure online environment, and receive support via text messages and over
      telephone. 150 CSOs over 18 years of age will be included. Measures will be taken at baseline
      3, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes concern gambling-related harm and motivating the PG to
      seek treatment. Secondary outcomes are CSO's feelings of depression, anxiety, relationship
      satisfaction and quality of life.

      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize: 1) that the CBT-CSO group will lead to a reduction
      in gambling related harm experienced by the CSO, 2) the CBT-CSO program will reduce the CSO's
      anxiety and depressive feelings, 3) the CBT-CSO program will decrease the amount of time and
      money the problem gambler spend on gambling, 4) the CBT-CSO program will increase the CSO's
      relationship satisfaction with the problem gambler.

    <description>The CBT-CSO program will be based on concepts from cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing, and is specifically developed for use with CSOs of treatment refusing problem gamblers. The program resembles the community reinforcement and family training approach that has been successfully used with CSOs of substance abusers.
The program will be given as guided self-help with guidance given via email and telephone. There are 8 modules, which all contain homework exercises and about 5-10 pages of text.</description>
