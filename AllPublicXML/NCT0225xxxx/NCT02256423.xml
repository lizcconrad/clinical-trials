      This is an open-label, randomised, 3-period, 3-sequence single-dose crossover study to
      determine the comparative pharmacokinetic profile of the Test Investigational Medicinal
      Product (IMP) Ibuprofen 200 mg soft gel capsule (lipid formulation) with that from the
      reference products Nurofen® 200 mg tablet and ibuprofen 200 mg soft gel capsule following
      single dose administration in healthy male and female subjects.

      The study comprises of a pre-study screen (within 14 days of the first dose), followed by 3
      Treatment Periods (1, 2 and 3) and a post study follow up (3 - 7 days after the last dose).
      Each Treatment Period is of 1 day in duration, from the afternoon before dosing (Day -1)
      until 12 hours (h) post-dose (Evening of Day 1). Study drug is administered on the morning of
      Day 1 following an overnight fast. PK samples will be collected pre-dose and up to 12 h
      post-dose (x15 samples) for the measurement of ibuprofen. Safety is evaluated at specified
      times throughout the study. There is at least 48 h between dose administrations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males and females between 18 and 50 years of age.

          2. Female subject of child bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at the
             Screening Visit and willing to use an effective method of contraception if applicable
             (unless of non-childbearing potential or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) from Day 1 until 3
             months afterwards.

          3. Female subject of non-child bearing potential with negative pregnancy test at the
             Screening Visit. For the purposes of this study, this is defined as the subject being
             amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months or at least 4 months post-surgical
             sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube ligation or bilateral oophorectomy
             with or without hysterectomy). Menopausal status will be confirmed by demonstrating at
             screening that levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) fall within the respective
             pathology reference range. In the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly
             established (for example, the subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10
             years), but FSH levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal condition,
             determination of subject eligibility will be at the discretion of the Chief
             Investigator following consultation with the Sponsor's Responsible Physician.

          4. Subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-30 kilogram (kg)/metre square (m2). Body
             Mass Index = Body weight in kg / [Height in m]2.

          5. Subject with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and
             urine examination values within 14 days of the first dose.

          6. Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 14 days of
             the first dose (a positive alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the
             Investigator).

          7. Subject with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.

          8. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead ECG determined within
             14 days of the first dose.

          9. Subject must be available to complete the study (including all follow up visits) and
             comply with study restrictions.

         10. Subject must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the
             study.

         11. Subject must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of allergy to NSAIDs or aspirin and history of peptic ulcer or
             gastrointestinal bleeding.

          2. A clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disorder likely to influence drug
             absorption, such as Gastroesophageal reflux disease

          3. Receipt of regular medication within 14 days of the first dose that may have an impact
             on the safety and objectives of the study (at the Investigator's discretion).

          4. Evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, respiratory, cardiovascular or
             metabolic dysfunction.

          5. A clinically significant history of previous allergy / sensitivity to ibuprofen.

          6. A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          7. Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          8. Participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 4 months or
             a marketed drug clinical study within the previous 3 months. (N.B. washout period
             between studies is defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose of the
             previous study and the first dose of the next study).

          9. Donation of 450 mL or more blood within the previous 3 months.

         10. Subjects who are current smokers, or those who have used nicotine products within the
             previous 3 months.

         11. Subject with positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.

         12. Any subject who, in the judgment of the Investigator, is likely to be non-compliant
             with study procedures and/or restrictions during the study, or unable to cooperate
             because of a language problem or poor mental development.

         13. Subjects must not have taken over the counter drugs and herbal remedies and
             supplements should not be taken from 7 days prior to the first dose and throughout the
             duration of the study dosing periods.

         14. Prescribed drugs should not be taken for 7 days before the first dose and throughout
             the duration of the study dosing periods. This does not include the oral contraceptive
             pill.
