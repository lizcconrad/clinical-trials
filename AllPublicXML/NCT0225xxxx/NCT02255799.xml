    <textblock>
      This is a four-site, randomized, parallel design, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week
      trial of donepezil 10 mg daily for verbal memory problems among adults with TBI in the
      subacute or chronic recovery period. The study will recruit 160 persons with TBI and
      functionally important memory problems during a four-year period of open recruitment.

      The study aims are:

        1. To evaluate the effects of treatment with donepezil on verbal memory as assessed by the
           Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Total Trial 1-3;

        2. To evaluate the effects of treatment with donepezil on memory-related activities as
           measured by the Everyday Memory Questionnaire;

        3. To evaluate the effects of donepezil on attention, processing speed, neuropsychiatric
           symptoms, community participation, quality of life, and caregiver experiences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Memory deficits are among the most common chronic and functionally important consequences of
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Basic and clinical research studies suggest that persistent
      deficits in verbal memory are associated with chronically reduced levels of acetylcholine in
      the brain. Medicines that increase levels of acetylcholine in the brain appear to improve
      memory and other cognitive problems experienced by persons with TBI. However, the studies
      performed thus far do not provide the level of evidence needed to establish best practices.
      This study will definitively establish whether, and to what extent, donepezil is an effective
      treatment for functionally important TBI-related memory deficit.

      The study begins with a Screening visit. After consent to participate in research is obtained
      from the participant or his or her legally-authorized representative, screening assessments
      are performed. Over the two weeks following that visit, study eligibility is determined.
      Participants meeting study inclusion/exclusion criteria are randomly assigned (1:1) to 1 of 2
      drug groups: donepezil or placebo.

      Participants then are evaluated at the Baseline (pre-treatment) Visit using assessments of
      physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning, community
      participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal. At the conclusion of this visit,
      participants begin a ten week treatment period with either donepezil 5 mg daily or matching
      placebo.

      Telephone contact occurs at the end of study week 1 and 2. Calls will assess and support
      participants' adherence to the study protocol, obtain information on treatment-related side
      effects, and address any other safety or tolerability concerns.

      At the week 2 telephone contact, participants tolerating the starting dose of study
      medication are advanced to donepezil 10 mg daily or matching placebo. Telephone contacts
      occur every 2 weeks until the Interim Assessment Visit at study week 6, at which time
      assessments of physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning,
      community participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal are performed.

      This visit is followed by a telephone contact at study week 8 and the Outcome Assessment
      Visit at study week 10. At that visit participants and caregivers complete assessments of
      physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning, community
      participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal. After completion of all week 10
      assessments, the extent to which participants and their caregivers remained blinded to study
      condition (allocation concealment) will be evaluated by inquiring whether they believe they
      received donepezil or placebo. Study staff also will offer a written opinion on the study
      condition to which each participant was assigned.

      The Discontinuation period (termination of study medication) begins upon conclusion of the
      final visit. Study teams at each site will remain available to receive questions and/or
      concerns from participants and/or caregivers during the 4-week Discontinuation period.

      Two analysis study populations will be considered in this study, a modified intent-to-treat
      (mITT) population and a clinically evaluable population. The mITT sample will include
      individuals deemed eligible for study participation based on the Screening Assessment; who
      are randomized to study treatment; who are assessed using HVLT-R at the Baseline Visit; and
      who receive at least one dose of study treatment. The analysis on the mITT sample will be
      considered the primary analysis. The clinically evaluable population will be a secondary
      analysis and called the per-protocol population. Inclusion in the per-protocol population
      will require at least eight weeks of double-blind study treatment, data on primary outcomes
      at the Outcome Assessment, at least 80% treatment adherence as determined by pill counts on
      returned blister packs, and no major protocol violations. For the primary outcome HVLT-R
      Total Trails 1-3, the primary analysis will examine the donepezil effect measured at week 10
      using a general linear model (GLM). Because the secondary outcomes are all approximately
      continuous-type, they will be tested using similar GLM procedures as stated above to estimate
      and test the effects of donepezil. Additionally, general linear mixed models will be
      performed to compare the data in the drug and placebo groups, accounting for center effect
      and other covariables. Side effects data in the form of the frequency of events (drug
      related/by severity/serious) will be evaluated using a Mantel-Haenszel test. Exact binomial
      confidence intervals for side effect event frequencies also will be generated.

      Findings from this study will influence the practices of prescribing healthcare providers and
      contribute information that will improve lives of persons with TBI and their families. In
      addition to dissemination of final study results, the MEMRI-TBI-D Study team will disseminate
      information on evidence-based treatments for memory impairment to consumer and professional
      audiences throughout the funding period. Through these knowledge translation activities,
      consumers and health care providers will be provided with information regarding the
      effectiveness of this intervention for persistent posttraumatic memory impairments.
