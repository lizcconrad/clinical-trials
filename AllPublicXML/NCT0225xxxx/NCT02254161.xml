  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      BI 1181181 in healthy young male and elderly male and female volunteers following oral
      administration of repeated rising doses of BI 1181181, given once daily over 10 days.
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of BI 1181181.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests.

          2. Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.) for young healthy volunteers or of 65 to 80 years
             (incl.) for elderly healthy volunteers.

          3. BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

          2. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          3. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          4. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          5. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             medication (except appendectomy)

          6. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), other neurological
             disorders or psychiatric disorders
