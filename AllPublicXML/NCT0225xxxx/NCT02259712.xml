      Introduction: Hipopressive Exercises are included within a method of physiotherapy which was
      created with the purpose of strengthening the deep muscles of the abdomen without damaging
      ligamentous and muscular structures of the perineum, also strengthening the muscles of pelvic
      floor reflexively. Although this technique has been included as treatment and a prevention
      method of pelvic floor dysfunction, there are few studies supporting its benefits. The
      investigators hypotthesis is that the combination of both physical therapy treatments will
      provided the best results for women who suffer pelvic floor dysfunctions.

      Objective: To determine whether Hipopressive Exercises are an option to include in the
      physiotherapy treatment of women suffer at least one pelvic floor dysfunction and whether the
      results reported are comparable to those provided by the classical perineal physiotherapy.

      Subjects and methods: A randomized clinical trial, the examiner being blinded unaware of the
      intervention group to which subjects were assigned. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      three groups:

        1. An experimental group, where the participants will be treated by Hipopressive exercises
           and hygienic and behavioral measures;

        2. Another experimental group where classical perineal physiotherapy will join with
           Hipopressive exercises and hygienic and behavioral advises;

        3. And a third group where will be done classical perineal physiotherapy and hygienic and
           behavioral measures.

      Pre- intervention, immediate post-intervention, 3, 6 and 12 months assessments will be made.
      The selection criteria will be: adult women who present signs and symptoms that indicate a
      pelvic floor dysfunction or have a medical diagnosis to confirm it. All participants must
      understand and sign freely Informed Consent.

      Sample size: Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast,
      26 subjects were required in each group to detect a difference equal to or greater than 3
      microvolts (Total of 78 subjects). It assumes a standard deviation of 4.8 microvolts and the
      rate of loss to follow up esteem 20% (Magalh√£es-Resende et al. 2012).

      Data Analysis: A descriptive analysis of all variables was performed. It establish for all
      cases a confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0.05). The effectiveness was assessed by comparing the
      experienced change of the three goups in outcome variables between physicaltherapy
      examinations.

    <description>The treatment duration is 2 days per week during 8 weks (two months). The aproximate duration of the season is 45 minutes. The protocol consists in:
Anatomical and physiological explanation of the pelvic girdle (perineal organs bony, ligaments and muscular structures of the entire abdominal and pelvic cavity).
Hygienic and behavioral advises preventing pelvic floor dysfunctions.
Awareness of the pelvic floor muscles.
Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles and the entire abdominal pelvic cavity. Use of electrostimulation and biofeedback in different positions if deemed necessary.
Treatment the abdominal-pelvic cavity pain if it requires.</description>
