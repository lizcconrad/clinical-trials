  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the high incidence of cervical cancer and high grade dysplasia and increased
      progression and incomplete treatment of CIN2 and 3 in South Africa, we propose to study the
      effect of cryotherapy among HIV-positive women diagnosed with CIN 1 versus regular 12 month
      cytology follow-up. This study will be a dual-arm, open-label, randomized clinical trial for
      HIV-infected women diagnosed with CIN 1 and receiving care at the Themba Lethu Clinic, Helen
      Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. CIN 1 will be identified from patients who have
      had a colposcopic biopsy for persistent LSIL as per standard of care.

      Women with HIV have a higher risk of cervical cancer. Screening and treatment formaly of the
      disease is limited die to poor access of screening programs and multiple visits. Women with
      HIV also have high progressions rates of disease amd my need to be treated earliers.
      Cryotherapy is a low option and very easy to implement especially in low resource provinces.

        -  It is cheaper and easier to administer than Large Loop electrosurgical excision
           procedure (LLETZ)

        -  No histology or transportation costs of specimens

        -  Less invasive than LLETZ

        -  It is nurse driven and easily learned

        -  It decreases loss to follow-up of patients due to reduced waiting time, transportation
           costs, time off work and HIV stigma

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV -infected women whose biopsy proves CIN1 and who consent to study participants and
             procedures

          -  CIN1 with no visible lesion

          -  The entire ectocervical lesion should cover less than 75% of the cervix and not more
             than 2 - 3mm into the endocervical canal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Known and previous treatment for HSIL by any method (Cryotherapy, LEEP or cone biopsy)

          -  Women who are menstruating or who have active pelvic inflammatory disease will be
             deferred from the study until the infection is cleared or the menstrual cycle has
             ended; the patient may then participate in the study.

          -  Unsatisfactory colposcopic examination defined as inability to see the extent of the
             lesion in the endocervical canal and lesions deemed ineligible for cryotherapy by an
             OB/GYN specialist.

          -  Previous hysterectomy with removal of the cervix
