  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new drug called ibrutinib in combination with the
      standard drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) as a possible treatment for
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is believed to block a protein
      called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By blocking this,
      it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.
      Ibrutinib has been FDA approved for the treatment of CLL patients who have received at least
      one prior treatment; however, the FDA has not yet approved ibrutinib as the first treatment
      for previously untreated CLL. Therefore, ibrutinib is still considered to be study drug,
      which means it is still being studied.

      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) are intravenous chemotherapy and antibody
      drugs that together are a standard chemotherapy regimen used for younger patients with CLL.
      Although FCR is highly effective, it does not typically lead to cure.

      In this research study, the investigators are combining a new treatment for CLL, ibrutinib,
      with a standard chemotherapy regimen for CLL, FCR, to determine whether this combination
      (iFCR) is safe and effective for patients with previously untreated CLL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic
             lymphoma. as per IW-CLL 2008 criteria. Patients must also require therapy for that
             diagnosis, based on meeting at least one of the following criteria:

          -  evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or
             worsening of, anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11.0 g/L) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100 x
             10^9/L)

          -  massive (≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic
             splenomegaly

          -  massive nodes (at least 10 cm longest diameter), progressive, or symptomatic
             lymphadenopathy

          -  progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month period or
             LDT of &lt;6 months. Lymphocyte doubling time may be obtained by linear regression
             extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts obtained at intervals of 2 weeks over an
             observation period of 2 to 3 months. In subjects with initial blood lymphocyte counts
             of &lt;30 x 10^9/L, LDT should not be used as a single parameter to define indication for
             treatment. In addition, factors contributing to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other
             than CLL (eg, infections) should be excluded

          -  autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids
             or other standard therapy

          -  documented constitutional symptoms, defined as 1 or more of the following
             disease-related symptoms or signs:

               -  unintentional weight loss &gt;10% within 6 months prior to screening

               -  significant fatigue (inability to work or perform usual activities)

               -  fevers &gt;100.5° F or 38.0° C for 2 or more weeks prior to screening without
                  evidence of infection

               -  night sweats for more than 1 month prior to screening without evidence of
                  infection

                    -  No prior CLL-directed therapy that was instituted due to patient previously
                       meeting IW-CLL 2008 criteria for treatment

                    -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 65. Because
                       CLL is extremely rare in persons &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded
                       from this study. Because iFCR is an aggressive therapy that is likely to be
                       less well-tolerated even in fit elderly subjects, persons &gt; 65 years of age
                       are excluded

                    -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

                    -  Adequate hematologic function independent of growth factor support for at
                       least 7 days prior to screening and randomization, with the exception of
                       pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) and darbepoetin which cannot be administered
                       within 14 days of screening.

          -  Patients must meet the following hematologic criteria at screening:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750 cells/mm3 (0.75 x 109/L).

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000 cells/mm3 (50 x 109/L).

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/L - Adequate hepatic and renal function defined as:

          -  Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN)

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of
                  non-hepatic origin)

               -  PT/INR &lt;1.5 x ULN and PTT (aPTT) &lt;1.5 x ULN.

               -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason and because similar agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
                  child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation.

          -  History of other malignancies, except:

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in

             outcomes at undue risk.

          -  Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled
             arrhythmia or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart
