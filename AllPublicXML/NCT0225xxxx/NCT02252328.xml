  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will compare the effect on disease control and immunosuppression treatment of
      adding simvastatin 80mg once daily, over a follow-up and treatment period of 2 years.
      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to standard treatment with placebo or standard
      treatment with the addition of simvastatin (80mg daily). They will be followed at 3 months
      intervals for 2 years with a primary end point of mean reduction in corticosteroid dosage at
      the 12 month follow-up visit.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-commercial trial to explore the effect of simvastatin 80mg od on the dose of
      corticosteroids and immunosuppression in patients with sight-threatening uveitis.

      In order to detect a clinical effect the study is designed as a double blinded, parallel
      group, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. Double blinding will be achieved through the use
      of a placebo as well as a masked clinical assessor.

      Based on the reported effect of simvastatin on brain atrophy among multi[le sclerosis
      patients after 12 months treatment, patients will receive treatment or placebo and will be
      treated and followed up for 24 months.

      Patients randomised to simvastatin will receive a dose of 80mg od. There will be no dose
      escalation.

      Patients will be reviewed every 3 months and will undergo a complete ophthalmic examination
      with treatment adjustment accordingly.
