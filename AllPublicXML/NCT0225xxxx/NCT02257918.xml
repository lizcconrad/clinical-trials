    <textblock>
      Uncomplicated gonorrhea is currently the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) worldwide and, accordingly, is a serious public health problem. This is a
      multi-center Phase 2 randomized, open-label study in approximately 180 adult male and female
      subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, with uncomplicated cervical or urethral gonorrhea.
      The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of an antimicrobial investigational
      product, AZD0914 manufactured by AstraZeneca, administered to adults to treat uncomplicated
      urogenital gonorrhea compared to treatment with intramuscular ceftriaxone. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned 70:70:40 to receive a single, oral dose of 2000 mg of AZD0914, 3000 mg of
      AZD0914, or intramuscular dose of 500 mg of ceftriaxone. The study duration is 11 months and
      subject participation of 30 days. Subjects with 1) untreated urethral or cervical gonorrhea
      identified via laboratory testing at a prior visit, or 2) untreated subjects acknowledging
      anal, oral, or vaginal sexual contact in the past 14 days with someone diagnosed with
      gonorrhea, or 3) signs and symptoms of urethral or cervical gonorrhea will be offered
      enrollment in the study and consented. The primary objective assess the efficacy by
      microbiological cure rate of 2000 mg or 3000 mg AZD0914 compared to 500 mg ceftriaxone for
      the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. The second primary objective assess the
      safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of 200 mg or 3000 mg AZD0914 compared to 500 mg
      ceftriaxone in adult subjects with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. The drug name is also
      known as ETX0914.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Microbiological Cure at Urethral or Cervical Sites in Each Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological cure was assessed at the Test of Cure visit (TOC). Microbiological Cure was derived from the Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture result and assessed by anatomical site. Male participants were swabbed at the urethral site and female participants at the cervical site. Remel RapID NH tests were performed on pure cultures obtained from swab specimens. A participant was defined as a microbiological cure if N. gonorrhoeae was not detectable by culture at TOC.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 31</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. Serious adverse events included any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life threatening; was a persistent/significant disability/incapacity; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation thereof was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes. Relationship to study product was determined by the investigator and defined as a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Cure in Each Study Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical cure was defined as the resolution of all signs and symptoms of gonorrhea (e.g. cervical/vaginal/urethral discharge, dysuria, dyspareunia, vulvovaginal irritation, sore throat) that were present at enrollment with the exception of vaginal discharge due to yeast vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis. A clinical failure was defined by the presence of any sign or symptom of gonorrhea that was also present at enrollment with the exception of vaginal discharge due to yeast vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis. The investigator also submitted his/her determination of whether the participant met or did not meet the criteria for clinical cure (or whether it is unknown if the participant met the criteria). In the event the investigator's assessment of clinical cure did not coincide with the definitions of clinical cure/failure, the investigator's assessment was the final adjudicator.</description>

    <measure>Median in Vitro Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) Against AZD0914/ETX0914 and Ceftriaxone of Gonococcal Isolates From Culture of Isolates From the Urethral/Cervical Sites at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>For all positive cultures of specimens collected from the urethra or cervix, isolates were collected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation. The MIC breakpoint was a chosen concentration of an antibiotic which defines whether a bacterial isolate is susceptible or resistant to the antibiotic. If the MIC was less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint, the bacteria was considered susceptible to the antibiotic. If the MIC was greater than this value, the bacteria was considered intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic.</description>

A clinical failure was defined by the presence of any sign or symptom of gonorrhea that was also present at enrollment with the exception of vaginal discharge due to yeast vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis. The investigator also submitted his/her determination of whether the participant met or did not meet the criteria for clinical cure (or whether it is unknown if the participant met the criteria). In the event the investigator’s assessment of clinical cure did not coincide with the definitions of clinical cure/failure, the investigator’s assessment was the final adjudicator.</description>

        <description>For all positive cultures of specimens collected from the urethra or cervix, isolates were collected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation. The MIC breakpoint was a chosen concentration of an antibiotic which defines whether a bacterial isolate is susceptible or resistant to the antibiotic. If the MIC was less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint, the bacteria was considered susceptible to the antibiotic. If the MIC was greater than this value, the bacteria was considered intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic.</description>

        <title>Median in Vitro MIC Against AZD0914/ETX0914 and Ceftriaxone of Gonococcal Isolates From Culture of Isolates From the Urethral/Cervical Sites at Day 6</title>
        <description>For all positive cultures of specimens collected from the urethra or cervix, isolates were collected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the MIC was determined. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation. The MIC breakpoint was a chosen concentration of an antibiotic which defines whether a bacterial isolate is susceptible or resistant to the antibiotic. If the MIC was less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint, the bacteria was considered susceptible to the antibiotic. If the MIC was greater than this value, the bacteria was considered intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic.</description>

If the MIC was less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint, the bacteria was considered susceptible to the antibiotic. If the MIC was greater than this value, the bacteria was considered intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic.</description>
