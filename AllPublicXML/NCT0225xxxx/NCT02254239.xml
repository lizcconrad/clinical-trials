      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of everolimus when given
      together with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has come
      back (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (refractory). Everolimus may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Brentuximab
      vedotin may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread by binding to a
      protein on the surface of cancer cells and then releasing a cancer-killing substance to them.
      Giving everolimus together with brentuximab vedotin may be a better treatment for Hodgkin
      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and optimal dose of everolimus given in combination with
      brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with brentuximab vedotin in
      relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To evaluate duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate response by positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT)
      based response criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess cytokines and free light chain before and after therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) or every other day (QOD) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1
      and everolimus PO QD or every other day on days 1-84 for 1 course.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning on course 17, patients receive everolimus PO QD, QOD, twice
      weekly, or thrice weekly on days 1-84. Courses repeat every 84 days in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.
