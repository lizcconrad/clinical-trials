      To test the hypotheses that plasma and intracellular coenzyme Q10 levels will decline after
      burn injury and that ubiquinol supplementation will increase plasma and intracellular
      coenzyme Q10 levels in burn patients.

      To test the hypothesis that ubiquinol supplementation ameliorates mitochondrial
      dysfunction/disintegrity and metabolic derangements, and decreases circulating alarmins
      (a.k.a. endogenous DAMPs) in burn patients as compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous clinical studies and our preliminary preclinical data, we want to test the
      hypotheses that plasma and intracellular coenzyme Q10 levels are decreased after burn injury
      and that coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation reverses or ameliorates insulin resistance,
      metabolic derangements, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased circulating DAMPs in burn
      patients. The aforementioned previous studies and preliminary data warrant a small-scale
      clinical study to evaluate coenzyme Q10 status, and bioavailability and efficacy of coenzyme
      Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation in burn patients. Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation
      could represent a novel, safe and low-cost strategy to improve the clinical outcome of burn
      patients. We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study
      with anticipated enrollment of 50 subjects. Adult burn patients with 5% or greater of total
      body surface area (TBSA) burn at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Burn Center will be
      approached to consider study participation. All enrolled patients will be randomized to
      receive coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) supplementation or placebo. Blood samples will be used for
      evaluation of coenzyme Q10 concentration, mitochondrial DNA copy number, non-mitochondrial
      DAMPs (e.g., cell-free total DNA), and defective neutrophil migration.
