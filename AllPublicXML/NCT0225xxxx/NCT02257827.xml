  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) versus
      the Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) in terms of toxicity and disease control. Data
      from retrospective studies show that IMRT reduces the risk of severe late complications. More
      recently, the results from the RTOG 0126 study have also confirmed the benefit from IMRT in
      reducing acute toxicity for prostate cancer treated with conventional dose escalation.
      Therefore, to investigate the real clinical benefit of the IMRT over 3DCRT using a
      hypofractionated schedule in prostate cancer, the investigators developed a RCT.

    <description>The primary study outcome was acute treatment reactions from the beginning of treatment to 6 months after the end of treatment. Patients were seen weekly, or as required, during treatment by a radiation oncologist. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were prospectively assessed and graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system for the rectum and bladder.</description>

    <measure>Gastrointestinal and geniturinary late toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any toxicity developed after 6 months from radiotherapy treatment was considered as late toxicity. Late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were prospectively assessed and graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system for the rectum and bladder.</description>

    <description>The IMRT plan consisted of five - seven fields to deliver the same dose prescribed at the isodose line covering 95% of PTV.By the linear-quadratic formula, considering an α/β ratio of 1.5 Gy for prostate cancer, 70 Gy/25 fractions is equivalent to 86 Gy in 43 fractions of 2 Gy. All patients were simulated on CT simulator.</description>

By the linear-quadratic formula, considering an α/β ratio of 1.5 Gy for prostate cancer, 70 Gy/25 fractions is equivalent to 86 Gy in 43 fractions of 2 Gy.
