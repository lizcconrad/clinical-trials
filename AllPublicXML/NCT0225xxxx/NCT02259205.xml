      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a yogurt enriched with bioactive lipids extracted
      from olive mill waste in platelet aggregation and other inflammatory and oxidative stress
      markers. The study will include three groups: the intervention group will receive the
      enriched yogurt while the other two groups will serve as controls (plain yogurt and no yogurt
      consumption).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Data from the
      investigators research group indicate that platelet activating factor (PAF) is one of the
      most important inflammatory factors and the main mediator of thrombosis during the formation
      of atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, dietary interventions aimed at inhibition of PAF is of
      particular importance in public health level. The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy
      of administering in humans bioactive lipids extracted from olive mill waste (with proven in
      vitro anti-thrombotic activity and in vivo anti-atherosclerotic properties in rabbits fed an
      atherogenic diet) to inhibit the activity of PAF and other inflammatory mediators.

      Bioactive lipids are isolated by standardized methodology of oil manufacture byproducts.
      Preliminary studies have been done in animals to establish the safety of administration of
      these compounds and to clarify the effective dosages of administration for inhibiting
      formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The effectiveness of these compounds in humans will be
      examined in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in subjects aged 40-60 years, lasting
      eight weeks. Supplementation with the bioactive lipids will be in the form of an enriched
      yogurt provided daily. The study includes three groups: treatment group, where enriched
      yogurt will be provided, plain yogurt treatment group and no consumption of yogurt group .
      Parameters that will be assessed are the inhibition of platelet aggregation (with three
      different stimuli, including PAF), lipid profile, inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6,
      TNFa, and oxidative stress markers.
