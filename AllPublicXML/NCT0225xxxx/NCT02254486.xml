      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NER1006 versus Trisulfate
      Solution (TS) in adult patients requiring bowel cleansing prior to any procedure that
      requires a clean bowel, using a 2-Day evening/morning Split-Dosing regimen. Approximately 540
      patients will be randomised with the aim of achieving a minimum of 245 patients in each of
      the 2 groups.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Successful Bowel Cleansing (Overall Colon)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days (from day of first dosing to day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). A final HCS grading of A, B, C or D was derived. Grades A and B are classified as successful (i.e., all mucosa could be visualised) and C and D are classified as unsuccessful. Comparison of overall success of cleansing with NER1006 versus Trisulfate solution was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With 'Excellent Plus Good' (Highly Effective) Bowel Cleansing (Colon Ascendens)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days (from day of first dosing to day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). Highly effective cleansing in the colon ascendens corresponded to scores 3 (Good) or 4 (Excellent) of the HCS. Adequate plus failure of cleansing corresponded to score 0-2. Comparison of 'Excellent plus good' cleansing of the colon ascendens using NER1006 versus Trisulfate Solution was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) defined as the number of patients with at least one adenoma in the colon ascendens.</description>
