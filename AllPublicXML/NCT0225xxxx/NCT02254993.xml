      healthy adult male and female subjects 18-75 years of age. All subjects will be assessed for
      safety and microbiology parameters. A subset of subjects will be assessed for pharmacokinetic
      parameters. No longer enrolling study subjects in Part A.

      Open-label, multiple arm, safety, microbiology and pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy
      adult male and female subjects 18-75 years of age conducted in two parts.

      Part A of the study will evaluate up to 6 study arms, depending on the microbiology response
      evaluated. Before dosing of C16G2, eligible subjects will undergo professional dental
      prophylaxis on Day 0. Clinic visits for all Study Arms include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to
      0), Treatment Visits 2 through 6 (Baseline/Day 0 through Day 4), and follow-up Visits 7
      through 11 (Day 5, 8, 12, 19 ± 1 and 33 ± 2).

      All subjects will be assessed for safety and microbiology parameters for approximately 5
      weeks. A subset of subjects in Study Arms 2 and 4 will be assessed for pharmacokinetic
      parameters. Part A of the study is no longer enrolling study subjects.

      Part B of the study will evaluate up to 5 study arms, depending on the microbiology response
      evaluated during 2 interim microbiology reviews. Clinic visits for all study arms except
      Study Arm 5 include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0), Visit 2 (Baseline/Day 0), Visits 3
      through 17 (Days 1 through 6, morning and evening visits, and Days 7, 10 and 14). All
      subjects will be assessed for safety and microbiology parameters for approximately 2 weeks.
      Before dosing of C16G2, eligible subjects will undergo professional dental prophylaxis on Day
      0. Study drug will be administered for 7 consecutive days. The Sponsor will perform a
      microbiology review to evaluate the S. mutans response in Study Arms 1 &amp; 2 and, if
      applicable, in Study Arms 3a or 3b. In Study Arm 5, subjects will receive multiple C16G2
      doses on a single day and will be evaluated for safety, microbiology and pharmacokinetic
      parameters. Clinic visits for Study Arm 5 will include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0),
      Visit 2 (Baseline/Day 0), Visit 3/Day 1 and Visit 4/Day 6.

             the study due to completion or Early Termination

          4. Healthy, as determined by the Investigator (in consultation with the Medical Monitor,
             as needed), based on medical and dental history, concurrent illnesses, laboratory

             products during the study

          9. Willing to postpone elective dental procedures (e.g., dental cleanings) between
             Screening and final post-treatment visit (End of Study or Early Termination)

             study dentifrice and oral care products, or interfere with the ability to comply with
             study requirements
