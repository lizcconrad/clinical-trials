  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to refine, implement, and evaluate a multi-component
      intervention that achieves sustainable and meaningful impact on healthcare quality, safety,
      and costs while ensuring dignity and respect for adult oncology and intensive care patients
      and their care partners. The PROSPECT (Promoting Respect and Ongoing Safety through
      Patient-centeredness, Engagement, Communication, and Technology) framework will achieve this
      by enhancing the patient-provider relationship and introducing patient-centered approaches to
      multi-disciplinary communication and patient education. The PROSPECT framework is based upon
      a validated structured, team-work training model and novel web-based technology. The
      overarching goals of this project are to achieve the following:

        1. Optimize the overall experience of patients (including their family/care partners) by
           promoting dignity/respect, encouraging engagement, improving care plan concordance, and
           enhancing satisfaction.

        2. Minimize preventable harms in two environments: intensive care and acute care oncology
           units.

        3. Reduce unnecessary healthcare resource utilization and associated costs.

      This overarching project aims are to refine, implement, and evaluate a multi-faceted
      intervention composed of the Patient-SatisfActive® model, developed by Drs. Ronen Rozenblum
      and David Bates at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a web-based Patient-Centered Toolkit
      (PCTK), developed by Drs. Dykes and Dalal, on quality, safety, and cost outcomes in the
      intensive care and oncology units at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The specific aims of the
      project are as follows:

        -  Aim 1: To refine and implement the Patient-SatisfActive® model to promote respect,
           dignity, and satisfaction of patients, care partners and staff on intensive care and
           oncology units.

        -  Aim 2: To refine and implement a web-based, Patient-Centered Toolkit (PCTK), comprised
           of an electronic bedside communication center (eBCC) and a patient-centered microblog,
           to promote tailored patient and care-partner education, communication, collaboration,
           and engagement.

        -  Aim 3: To evaluate the relative impact of this intervention compared to usual care on
           patient reported outcome measures, adverse events (harms), post-discharge healthcare
           utilization, concordance in understanding the care plan, and satisfaction among care
           team members (patients/care partners, profession providers).

        -  Aim 4: To identify the barriers and facilitators of implementing this intervention to
           support dissemination.

    <measure>Preventable Harms (Adverse Events) in the Acute Care Setting</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrolled patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, typically ranging from 5 to 30 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Preventable adverse events in the acute care setting include medication errors, patient falls, veno-thromboembolism, hospital acquired infection, central line related bloodstream infection, ventilator associated pneumonia, catheter associated urinary tract infection, newly acquired physical harm/injury. We will measure the rate of adverse events acquired from the time of admission to study units through hospital discharge. Using an adaptation of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Global Trigger Tool, we will randomly sample charts of enrolled patients from intervention and control units during the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods to identify adverse events. The length of hospital stay for patients admitted to medical intensive care and oncology units at our institution is variable, typically ranging from 5 to 30 days.</description>

    <description>Randomly selected patients transferred from the MICU units will receive FS-ICU survey, semi-structured interviews, and 45-day post-hospitalization phone survey
Randomly selected patients discharged from Oncology units will receive semi-structured interviews and 45-day post-hospitalization phone survey. Data from national patient satisfaction survey, HCAHPS, will be collected and analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare Resource Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of hospital admission through 30-days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Inpatient healthcare utilization measures: Total cost of hospitalization and hospital length of stay (total, ICU, and non-ICU) from administrative data for each enrolled patient.
Post-discharge healthcare utilization measures: Rate of unscheduled utilization of health care resources (ambulatory/urgent care visits, emergency room visits, hospital readmissions) during the 30-day post-discharge period using the combination of administrative data and patient reports during their 30-day interview.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Plan Concordance</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 48-72 hours after admission to study unit</time_frame>
    <description>Structured interviews (9-question survey) with patient/care partners, a member of the inpatient medical team (attending, resident, or intern), inpatient nurses, and one additional care team member (e.g., PCP, ambulatory specialists) will be conducted after admission to MICU or Oncology units. Concordance for each item of survey will be rated on a 3-point scale (0, 1, 2) for each dyad. The scores of all dyads will be summed as a global concordance score for each patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of Communication/Collaboration</measure>
    <time_frame>Once during baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention periods, approximately 12 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dignity and Respect</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of transfer/discharger from study unit and up to 45-days post-hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Randomly selected patients transferred from the MICU will receive the FS-ICU survey, which contains several questions related to dignity and respect. Randomly selected patients will also receive semi-structured interviews to enhance understanding of dignity and respect.
Randomly selected patients discharged from Oncology units will receive semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of dignity and respect and a 45-day post-hospitalization phone survey. Relevant data from national patient satisfaction survey, HCAHPS, will be collected and analyzed.</description>

    <description>The PCTK provides patients/care partners tailored health information regarding conditions, test results, and medications presented at a consumer health literacy level, and the ability to communicate with care team members via &quot;patient-facing&quot; tools accessible from bedside tablet computers. The PCTK allows patients to post questions to their care team members via a patient-centered microblog. The microblog facilitates development of a collaborative patient plan of care. The &quot;provider-facing&quot; PCTK includes tools that engage care team members in 1) completing a safety checklist and viewing a safety dashboard; 2) viewing patient-inputted information (goals, preferences, concerns) regarding the plan of care; 3) identifying clinical problems, care team goals, and patient schedules for education and multidisciplinary communication; 4) messaging patients on the &quot;patient thread&quot;; and 5) discussing patient's plan of care with other providers via the &quot;provider thread&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Patient-SatisfActive Model is a structured, pro-active, patient-centered care model that aims at improving patient satisfaction by enhancing the degree to which patients' needs, concerns and expectations are met and by preserving dignity and respect. The model comprises steps that enhance interpersonal communication between clinicians and patients, incorporates clinicians' efforts to ascertain, address and document patients' needs, concerns, expectations and perceptions throughout hospitalization, and includes elements that empower and engage patients in their care.</description>
