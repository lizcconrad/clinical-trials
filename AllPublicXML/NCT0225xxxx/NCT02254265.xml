    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 different dose
      concentrations of OTX-101 dosed twice a day in both eyes for 84 days compared to placebo
      (vehicle) in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is a common multifactorial ophthalmologic disorder of the
      tears and ocular surface characterized by symptoms of burning, stinging, itching, grittiness,
      scratchiness, foreign body sensation, dryness, stickiness and tired eye sensation.

      This study is the first clinical safety and efficacy study with OTX-101 and is designed to
      compare two dose concentrations of OTX-101 against vehicle (placebo) in reducing the signs
      and symptoms of KCS and evaluate safety when dosed twice a day in both eyes over an 84 day
      period.

             the study.

         26. Has a severe/serious ocular condition, or any other unstable medical condition that,
             in the Investigator's opinion, may preclude study treatment or follow-up.

         28. Participation in any drug or device clinical investigation within 30 days prior to
