      This study evaluates pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag 50 mg after the oral administration in
      Mexican healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. The study will be an open label, single
      dose study with 26 subjects planned to be enrolled. Healthy subjects (male and female) aged
      between 18 - 50 years of age (inclusive) and a Body Mass Index within the range of 18-27.0
      kg/meter (m)^2 (inclusive) were enrolled according to Quetelet. REVOLADE is a registered

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects' participation must be voluntary according to the General Health Law and an
             informed consent form must be obtained for each subject before their participation.
             Compliance to HelsinkiÂ´s Declaration, its Japan Review and good clinical practice
             (GCP) should be followed.

          -  Mexican male and female healthy volunteers with 18 to 50 years old will be included. A
             female subject is eligible to participate if she is of, Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             &gt; 40 milliinternational units per milliliter (MlU/ml) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per
             milliliter [pg/ml] [&lt;147 picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory). Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the
             Investigator/designee, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to
             study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method). Child-bearing potential
             with negative pregnancy test as determined by (serum or urine) human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing abbr de ante meridiem (AN ).
             Agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed by Investigator/designee for an
             appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior
             to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception until seven days after the drug
             administration. or has only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual
             lifestyle.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18-27.0 kilogram per meter (kg/m^2) according to
             Quetelet.

             physicians in the center and by their safety labs results done at a certified local
             laboratory.

          -  Variation limits within normal ranges on their screening visit are: Blood pressure
             (BP) (seating) between 90 and 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for Systolic pressure
             and between 60 and 90 mmHg diastolic pressure, heart rate (HR) between 55 and 100
             beats per minute (bpm) and respiratory rate (RR) between 14 and 20 per minute.

          -  Safety laboratory tests to be done include: Hematology: Complete blood count with
             differential, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, platelet count, etc; Blood chemistry: Albumin,
             Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase

             Leukocytes, Microscopic examination; Hepatitis B and C tests; human Immunodeficiency
             Virus (HIV) test; Serum pregnancy test; Drug abuse test; Alcohol detection test; Urine
             Pregnancy test; ECG; Chest X ray. Normal variation limits for laboratory values will
             be +/- 10% from normal range, unless the principal investigator (PI) considers another
             deviation as clinically non-significant. In that case, values should be documented in
             the volunteer's clinical file as well as the decision to include the subject prior
             consult with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor. For safety reasons and as per the
