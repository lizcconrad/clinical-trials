    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the biological responses elicited by
      endotoxin inhalation applied to healthy subjects, and to assess the effect of standard
      anti-inflammatory agents (i.e. adalimumab and methylprednisolone) on these biological
      responses.

      This open-label, single-center, parallel-group clinical trial is designed to evaluate Humira®
      or methylprednisolone versus no treatment in healthy subjects applied inhaled endotoxin
      challenges.

      A total of 30 healthy adult subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1 subjects receive no study drug during the study.

        -  Cohort 2 subjects receive an oral 7-day course of the corticosteroid
           (methylprednisolone) during the study, starting on study Day 1. The daily dose is 20 mg.

        -  Cohort 3 subjects receive a single subcutaneous injection of the anti-tumor necrosis
           factor (TNF) (adalimumab) on study Day 1, administered as a 40 mg dose.

      The study will include a Screening period of up to 21 days, during which subject eligibility
      will be assessed and Screening responses to endotoxin exposure challenge will be collected.
      Eligible subjects will initially undergo an 8-day treatment period, during which they will
      receive treatment based on their assigned cohort (or will receive no treatment if assigned to
      Cohort 1) and will be applied with the endotoxin challenges. After the treatment period,
      subjects will be followed up until study Day 42.

      Efficacy evaluations will include specific responses to endotoxin challenge, and effects of
      methylprednisolone and adalimumab on these responses. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
