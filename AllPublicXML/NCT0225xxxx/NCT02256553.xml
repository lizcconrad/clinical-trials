  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of MK-3641 (short ragweed
      [Ambrosia artemisiifolia] extract, SCH 039641, RAGWITEK®) sublingual tablets and MK-7243
      (Timothy grass [Phleum pratense] extract, SCH 697243, GRASTEK®) sublingual tablets
      co-administered in participants 18 through 65 years of age with both ragweed- and grass
      polled-induced allergic rhinitis, with or without conjunctivitis and with or without asthma.
      The primary endpoint is the percentage of participants who experience at least one event of
      local swelling after co-administration of MK-3641 and MK-7243 sublingual tablets.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Event of Local Swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>During Period I, Period II and Period III (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Events of local swelling included pharyngeal edema, laryngeal edema, mouth edema, oropharyngeal swelling, palatal edema, tongue swelling/edema, or throat tightness. Events that occurred during in-clinic dosing were to be monitored and recorded by clinic staff. A Side Effect Report Card was used in Periods I-III to collect information on adverse events identified by the World Allergy Organization (WAO) as local side effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) that occurred within the first 60 minutes after study drug intake. During Period I, participants were to complete the report card once a day after MK-7243 was administered. During Period II, participants were to complete the report card twice a day, once after each tablet was administered. During Period III, participants were to complete the report card once a day after both tablets were administered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Event of Local Application Site Reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>During Period I, Period II and Period III (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Events of local application site reactions included pharyngeal edema, laryngeal edema, mouth edema, oropharyngeal swelling, palatal edema, tongue swelling/edema, throat tightness, lip swelling/edema, ear pruritus, dysphagia, oral discomfort, glossodynia, oral pruritus, hypoaesthesia oral, throat irritation, paraesthesia oral or stomatitis. Events that occurred during in-clinic dosing were to be monitored and recorded by clinic staff. A Side Effect Report Card was used in Periods I-III to collect information on adverse events identified by the WAO as local side effects of SLIT that occurred within the first 60 minutes after study drug intake. During Period I, participants were to complete the report card once a day after MK-7243 was administered.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>During Period I, Period II and Period III (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, was also an AE.</description>

        <description>Events of local swelling included pharyngeal edema, laryngeal edema, mouth edema, oropharyngeal swelling, palatal edema, tongue swelling/edema, or throat tightness. Events that occurred during in-clinic dosing were to be monitored and recorded by clinic staff. A Side Effect Report Card was used in Periods I-III to collect information on adverse events identified by the World Allergy Organization (WAO) as local side effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) that occurred within the first 60 minutes after study drug intake. During Period I, participants were to complete the report card once a day after MK-7243 was administered. During Period II, participants were to complete the report card twice a day, once after each tablet was administered. During Period III, participants were to complete the report card once a day after both tablets were administered.</description>
