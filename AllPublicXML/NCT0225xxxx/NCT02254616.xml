  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contemporary behavior interventions focused on upper limb training such as robotic-assisted
      training and constraint-induced movement therapy have been proven to promote motor recovery.
      However, the improvement is often of limited in practical significance. Mirror therapy (MT)
      and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain based on similar principle of
      utilizing brain plasticity have shown benefits in promoting motor function recovery and are
      particularly easy to apply in different settings. tDCS activates a bulk of neural circuits in
      a non-specific way, coupling tDCS with MT could steer plastic process toward a functional
      direction. However, current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of tDCS as an
      adjuvant to upper limb training, and long-term effect has yet to be explored.

      Cortical stimulation clearly has its role in stroke rehabilitation. However, current evidence
      is insufficient to support the efficacy of tDCS as an adjuvant to MT, and long-term effect
      has yet to be explored. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial will aim to examine (1) the
      beneficial effects of hybrid therapy (i.e., MT with tDCS) on health-related outcomes in
      patients with chronic stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of the hybrid therapy on activity
      participation at 6-month follow-up; (3) the underlying mechanisms of the hybrid therapy on
      motor control and brain organization; (4) the correlations between brain excitability
      patterns and movement kinematics/health-related outcomes. Accordingly, we will compare the
      hybrid therapy vs MT with sham tDCS vs MT vs conventional intervention (CI) on motor
      performance, daily function, and activity participation. We will also examine underlying
      mechanisms by kinematic measures for motor control and fMRI analyses for brain
      reorganization. The MT with sham tDCS group is included to achieve a double-blinded design
      (patient and evaluator blinded) with the MT with real tDCS group. The MT only group is
      included to examine if there exist a placebo effect of the presence of tDCS setting in the MT
      with sham tDCS. The CI group is included to provide a baseline treatment to see if the other
      three therapies induce larger improvements compared to currently standard therapy. We
      hypothesize that (1) the hybrid therapy will induce greater improvements on some
      health-related outcomes compared to other therapies; (2) such benefits will retain at 6-month
      follow-up; (3) better motor control and brain reorganization will be found in the hybrid
      therapy than the other therapies; (4) correlations will be found between brain activity and
      movement kinematics/health-related outcomes. This study will be the first to investigate
      effects of the hybrid therapy, MT with tDCS, in chronic stroke. This study is unique in
      examining changes at different levels including motor performance, daily function, and
      activity participation, as well as brain and motor organization. To address the inconsistent
      benefits in daily function outcomes in previous research in MT and tDCS in stroke
      rehabilitation, we will modify the existing treatment protocols and include a 30-minute
      functional training into each treatment session in all groups. The result of this project
      might unveil a potentially better hybrid intervention for chronic stroke population to choose
      from, compared to a stand alone therapy such as MT and CI. And the result will also provide
      information on changes in motor control and brain organization which help understand the
      underlying mechanism. The follow-up examination will provide information on long term effect
      at the level of activity participation, which is crucial considering that chronic stroke
      patients are most likely living in community. In addition, we may provide critical
      information on the association between brain activity and movement patters/functional
      outcomes in terms of analyzing the correlation of fMRI data with hand kinematics/
      health-related outcomes.

      Chronic stroke participants will be recruited from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and then
      were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 groups: MT+tDCS, MT+sham tDCS, MT, and CI groups. The
      participants in each group receive equivalent amounts of treatment.

      Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for the pretest differences, will be separately
      performed for each outcome measure to test the effects of different intervention groups.

    <measure>Change scores of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity subscale of the FMA will be used to assess motor impairment. The 33 upper limb items measure the movement and reflexes of the shoulder/elbow/forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. They are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully). The maximum score is 66, indicating optimal recovery. The sub-score of a proximal shoulder/elbow (FMA s/e: 0-42) and a distal hand/wrist (FMA h/w: 0-24) will be also calculated to investigate the treatment effects on separate upper extremity elements. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the FMA in stroke patients have been shown to be good.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment requires the participant to perform 15 function-based and 2 strength-based tasks. The tasks are averaged to produce a score in seconds that ranges from 0 to 120 seconds. For functional ability scoring, we used a 6-point ordinal scale where 0 indicates &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;arm does participate; movement appears to be normal.&quot; The clinimetrics of the WMFT has been ascertained in stroke patients (Wolf et al., 2005).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL consists of 30 structured questions to interview how the patients rate the frequency (amount of use subscale) and quality (quality of movement subscale) of movements while using their affected arm to accomplish each of the 30 daily activities. The score of each item ranges from 0 to 5, and the higher scores indicate more frequently used or higher quality of movements. The clinimetric properties of the MAL in stroke patients have been validated (Uswatte, Taub, Morris, Light, &amp; Thompson, 2006).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Stroke Impact Scale Version 3.0 (SIS 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS 3.0 is a stroke-specific instrument of health-related quality of life. It contains 59 items measuring 8 domains (i.e., strength, hand function, activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion. memory and thinking and participation) with a single item assessing perceived overall recovery from stroke. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with lower scores indicating greater difficulty in task completion during the past week. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness have been shown to be satisfactory in stroke patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (rNSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The rNSA includes tactile sensation, kinesthetic sensation, and stereognosis. The rNSA is reliable measure of sensory function in stroke patients. For tactile sensation, the patient will be asked to indicate whenever he or she feels the test sensation. For kinesthetic sensations, all 3 aspects of movement will be tested: appreciation of movement, its direction and accurate joint position sense. The limb on the affected side of the body will be supported and moved by the examiner in various directions but movement is only at one joint at a time. The patients will be asked to mirror the change of movement with the other limb. For stereognosis, the object will be placed in the patient's hand for a maximum of 30 seconds. Identification is by naming, description or by pair-matching with an identical set. The object may be moved around the affected hand by the examiner. The rNSA has good intrarater and interrater reliability (Lincoln, Jackson, &amp; Adams, 1998).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 4 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AAP will be applied to indicate the level of participation in household and community activities. This profile includes 21 activities in the four areas: domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others, and social activities. It scores on a scale of 0-3, with higher point meaning more frequent participation. The AAP is found to have good validity and reliability (Bond &amp; Clark, 1998). The Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) Scale (Nouri, &amp; Lincoln, 1987) is frequently used in clinical practice and research in rehabilitation to assess patients' independence in activities of daily living. Twenty-two activities are considered, which full in to 4 subscales: mobility, kitchen, domestic, and leisure activity. Responses are using 1 of 4 options (0 = not at all, 1 = with help, 2 = on my own with difficulty, 3 = on my own).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10MWT assess mobility function by measuring the time and the numbers of strides required to walk 10 meters under two conditions: (1) with the self-pace of each participant (self-pace); (2) with the speed that the participants walked as soon as possible. The velocity and stride length of the participant are calculated. Research has validated the 10MWT in measuring mobility in stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The activity monitors will be used to provide a direct and objective measure of the amount of the impaired arm movement outside the laboratory. This measure, quantitatively recording the amount of activity in free-living conditions, will be used to reflect increase in the amount of affected arm use over time. The participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor, Actigraphy (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York), on each wrist for 3 consecutive days to measure what amount they actually do in their daily life before and immediately after treatment. The Actigraphy can be attached to the subject's limb and measures the motion of that limb through an accelerometer. In this project, acceleration will be sampled at 10 Hz and summed over a user-specified epoch. The recording epoch will be 2 seconds; recording capacity will be approximately 72 hours. The ratio of affected to non-affected arm movement is a reliable and valid real-life measure of treatment outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Kinematic analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The kinematic analysis will involve unilateral and bilateral tasks, in which the participants will be asked to perform by using the affected upper limb or both upper limb simultaneously. A motion analysis system with 7 cameras (VICON MX 30d, Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK) will be used to capture the motion of arm (s) in kinematic testing. The markers will be attached on the styloid processes of the ulna. Depending on the unilateral or bilateral tasks, the makers will be placed on the affected arm or the both arms, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of hand strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Baseline digital hydraulic hand dynamometer and pinch gauge (Fabrication Enterprises Inc, NY.) were used for measurement of grip and pinch strength. For the grip strength measurement, participants were instructed to squeeze the dynamometer with their hand as hard as they could. For the lateral pinch strength measurement, the pinch gauge was positioned between the pad of the thumb and the radial side of the middle phalanx of the index finger. For palmar pinch strength measurement, the pinch gauge was grasped between the pad of the thumb and the pad of the index finger. Participants were told to pinch as hard as they could. This method shows high repeatability (Haidar, Kumar, Bassi, &amp; Deshmukh, 2004).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Commander Algometer (JTECH Medical, USA) is designed for easy handling and fine resolution to identify clinically significant pain sensitivity changes. The Commander Algometer provides a convenient, efficient, objective pain evaluation tool for treatment planning, progress evaluation and case management. The measured pressure thresholds/tolerances and trigger point tenderness will be reported by patients.</description>
