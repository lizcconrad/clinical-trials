  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized phase II trial studies how well photodynamic therapy using blue light
      or red light works in treating basal cell cancer (carcinoma) in patients with a genetic
      condition that causes unusual facial features and disorders of the skin, bones, nervous
      system, eyes, and endocrine glands, also called basal cell nevus syndrome. Photodynamic
      therapy uses drugs, such as aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, that are taken up by tumor
      cells and when exposed to an intensive light source (blue light or red light) become active
      and may kill the cells. It is not yet known whether photodynamic therapy is more effective
      with blue light or red light in treating basal cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cyclic photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment is effective in curing
      existing basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tumors in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS),
      and whether red light or blue light is more effective in this regard.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability (pain during treatment) of red light versus blue light in this
      patient population.

      II. To assess patient satisfaction with the technique.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically. Beginning 4 hours later,
      patients undergo photodynamic therapy using blue light on the left side of the body and red
      light on the right side of the body on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 2 months for 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically. Beginning 4 hours
      later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy using blue light on the right side of the body
      and red light on the left side of the body on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 2 months
      for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
