    <textblock>
      This study evaluates that P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, K. pneumonia and Staph aureus which
      are obtained from patients' tracheal aspiration culture who treated with mechanical
      ventilation will be compared with Lactobacillus (LAB) members and nisin bactriocin in the
      laboratory. The aim is to investigate the probiotics' antimicrobial properties and effects on
      these bacteria's growth rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most commonly seen hospital-acquired
      infections that occurs in patients who receive mechanical ventilation. VAP usually occurs
      48-72 hours after mechanical ventilation and is related increased incidence of
      multidrug-resistant infections, increased antibiotic use, extended mechanical ventilation
      time, increased patient stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and increased patient stay in
      the hospital. One recent intervention is the probiotic therapy which is a nonantibiotic
      strategy for maintenance of the host's aerodigestive microbial balance and VAP
      prevention.Common causative pathogens of VAP include Gram negative bacteria such as
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species, and Gram-positive
      bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, these Gram negative pathogens obtained
      from mechanical ventilated patients' tracheal aspiration culture and reference bacteria
      strains will be compared with Lactobacillus (LAB) members and nisin in the laboratory.
      Probiotics' antimicrobial properties and effects on these bacteria's (obtained from patients
      and reference strains) growth rate will be investigated.

    <description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staph aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae will be isolated from tracheal aspiration cultures. 80 isolates associated with pneumonia will be identified and made antibiogram with VITEK. Then antimicrobial effects of Lactobacillus bacteria (LAB) (Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (ATCC 11454), Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris (DSMZ 20346), Streptococcus thermophilus (NCFB2392), Pediococcus acidophilus (ATCC 25741)) and nisin bacteriocin will be investigated on the bacteria's growth rate in the laboratory.</description>

        Patients who mechanically ventilated at least 48 hours will be included. Patients' tracheal
        aspirate cultures will be used for study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii,
        Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae will be isolated from tracheal aspiration
        cultures.Antimicrobial effects of Lactobacillus members will be investigated on the
        bacteria's growth rate in the laboratory.
