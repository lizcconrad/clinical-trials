      This study aims to study the efficacy of a preoperative &quot;bundle&quot; of interventions, which
      consists of preoperative physiotherapy, nutritional support and cognitive exercises on
      elderly frail patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, and evaluating their outcomes.
      There will be two arms, intervention and control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome, defined as an increased vulnerability to stressors leading
      to a state of decreased physiological resistance. It is characterised by a &quot;constellation of
      symptoms and signs that describe the heterogeneous response of older adults to physiological
      and metabolic challenges.&quot; While frailty is not necessarily synonymous with chronological
      age, it is more prevalent among the older adult population and is associated with up to a
      threefold increased risk of mortality or major morbidity postsurgery. Thus, it has become
      critically important for healthcare systems to develop strategies designed to improve
      clinical outcomes in this high-risk population when undergoing surgeries.

      Currently there is no clear intervention that has been proven to modify the syndrome of
      frailty or its impact on postoperative outcomes. This study investigates a novel
      multidisciplinary approach that can be implemented within a short time frame prior to
      surgery.

      We plan to study the efficacy of a preoperative &quot;bundle&quot; of interventions, which consists of
      preoperative physiotherapy, nutritional support and cognitive exercises on elderly frail
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, and evaluating their outcomes based 1) length of
      hospital stay 2) Functional recovery from surgery 3) post-operative complications.

A 'Threshold' Inspiratory Muscle Trainer
A nutritional assessment: if needed, dietary supplements prescribed (i.e Ensure, Glucerna).
Cognitive exercise in the form of the 'Memory' card game will be taught to the patients and the caregiver (if available), to be done twice a day.
Patients will be provided with a protocol activities log and a study assistant will be conducting a telephone conversation on day 1, 4 and 7 to encourage compliance to the protocol and answer any queries with regards to the research study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients attending the Preoperative Evaluation Clinic, SGH at least 11 days prior to
             his/her elective major abdominal surgery. Major abdominal surgery is defined as an
             intraperitoneal surgery with expected length of stay beyond 2 days. For patients who
             attended the clinic more than 11 days prior to surgery date, they will be informed to
             start their prehabilitation bundle 10 days prior to surgery.

          2. Aged 65 and above

          3. Diagnosed as frail based on Fried criteria score 3and above

          4. Able to understand and follow the prescribed cognitive and physical exercise

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Parkinson disease, previous stroke, neuromuscular disorders and those
             taking carbidopa/levodopa, donepezil hydrochloride or antidepressants as previous
             studies have found that these medications may cause symptoms that are similar with
             domains of frailty.

          2. Patients who are not able to communicate
