  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      With the existing biologic anti-inflammatory product patents expiring and the FDA approval of
      new biosimilar and innovator biologics, patients with rheumatologic (RA), psoriatic
      (PsO-PsA-AS), and gastrointestinal (GI) conditions will have additional therapeutic options.
      This observational study will describe the patient characteristics of new users of Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-α (TNF) antagonists, non-TNF- α antagonists, oral DMARD, and non-biologic
      agents. It will describe in the treatment cohorts outcomes of serious infections that require
      hospitalization. The BBCIC will use the findings from this descriptive analysis to design a
      comparative study evaluating the real-world effectiveness and safety of biosimilar and
      innovator anti-inflammatory biologics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Additional information:

      To most effectively interpret results from this descriptive analysis it is important to
      consider that this protocol was not designed to support a hypothesis. This information is
      being provided to the public in the interest of transparency and for demonstrating the
      BBCIC's Distributed Research Network's (DRN) ability to define exposures, outcomes,
      covariates and confounders. When published, the report will caution that the protocol does
      not support any ability to compare safety or effectiveness but instead is to be used only to
      explore the feasibility of future, more detailed comparative analyses and to better
      understand the capabilities of the BBCIC project. Further, the report will caution that
      information from this protocol should not affect use of the medical products described in any
      way and the fact that the BBCIC is performing this descriptive analysis in no way suggests
      there is a safety or effectiveness issue with any of the products described.

        Health Cooperative, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and HealthPartners. The time period
        assessed will be 1/1/2006 - 9/30/2015.
