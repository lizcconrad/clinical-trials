  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore how feedback of cellular DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
      damage, as a marker of exposure to the genotoxic agents of tobacco smoke, promotes cessation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to recruit 50 smokers who are not engaged in quitting. The study will involve
      two in-person visits. During visit 1, participants will complete a baseline survey and have
      their blood drawn. Approximately two weeks later, in visit 2, smokers will be randomized in a
      1:2:2 ratio to one of three arms:

        1. education about harms of smoking (control group);

        2. same education plus information on DNA damage and biomarker feedback (biomarker arm)
           without visual of damage; or

        3. same as arm 2 except accompanied with visuals of participants' normal and DNA damage
           cells. Participants in the this arm will be informed of their proportion of leucocytes
           showing DNA damage with pictures of their normal and damaged cells.

      The goal of the analyses is to obtain effect size estimates (direction, confidence intervals)
      to inform if results align with hypotheses and obtain insights about reactions about the
      feedback (Aim 1). The study will collect feasibility data from baseline to three months
      (e.g., percentage who show up to the sessions, attrition).
