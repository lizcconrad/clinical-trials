      1. Identify the tissue proteins associated with early breast cancer invasion phases without
           lymph node involvement .

        2. Consider their role in the invasion and the risk of tumor spread .

      This proteomic study is performed on biological samples originally as part of a diagnostic
      approach reclassified in the absence of opposition from patients, from the Biobank of Nîmes
      University hospital (Ministry of Higher Education and Research No. AC-2008-107; South
      Mediterranean CPP III No. COL2008.04.02).

      For validation part, the investigators will work on sections of TMA already made from samples
      drawn between 2000 and 2003.
