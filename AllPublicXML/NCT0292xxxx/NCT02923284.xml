  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC or kidney cancer) in men exceeds that of
      pancreatic cancer or leukemia. In women, the incidence of RCC is similar to that of leukemia,
      ovarian, or pancreatic cancer; thus, RCC is significant health issue. This study focuses on
      identifying specific molecules [biomarkers] of RCC that can be used to develop a reliable
      low-cost screening method at the point of service. If successful, our method would provide a
      diagnostic test to distinguish benign kidney masses from malignant ones, eliminating the need
      to surgically remove a kidney with a benign tumor.

        Patients that are 18 years of age and older and undergoing planned surgical procedure for
        removal of an imaged renal mass will be consented in the Center for Preoperative Assessment
        and Planning (CPAP), the holding area on the day of surgery, and the holding area of
        radiology. A urine sample will be collected from subject following informed consent.
        Additionally, discarded urine samples will be collected from the BJH Chemistry Labs from
        patients admitted for surgery for non-kidney cancer as a comparator group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients 18 years of age and older undergoing surgery. Patient samples are divided into 2
        groups based on their surgery: Patients with an imaged renal mass, encompassing about 300
        patients/year (about 1200 total) of both malignant (about 80-85% of time) and benign (about
        15-20% of time), and patients with non-kidney cancers, encompassing about 6,000
        patients/year (about 24,000 total),

        Age &lt;18 years and prisoners.
