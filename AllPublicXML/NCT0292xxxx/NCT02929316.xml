  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is characterized as an autoimmune disorder whereby gluten (a protein
      found in wheat, barley, rye, malt) induces an immunological response in genetically
      susceptible individuals. The prevalence of CD has been estimated to affect 0.5-1% of the
      population worldwide. Long term sequelae are numerous and include risk of lymphoma,
      malabsorption leading to weight loss, anemia, multiple vitamin deficiencies,
      osteoporosis/osteopenia, secondary autoimmunity, etc. (1)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects with CD will be recruited through our clinic. All patients enrolled will have
      established CD diagnosed &gt; 6 months. All patients will have history of abnormal MARSH score
      on initial duodenal biopsy at diagnosis and MARSH 0 on repeat biopsy following a gluten free
      diet (GFD). All patients will also have positive celiac serologies (anti-TTG, anti-gliadin,
      etc.) at diagnosis, as well as, positive HLA DQ2/DQ8 genetic profile. At enrollment, all
      patients will have negative celiac serologies, indicative of serologic remission on a gluten
      free diet. Female subjects of childbearing potential (does not include those with history of
      tubal ligation/surgical sterilization, hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) who are sexually
      active with a non-sterilized male partners agree to routinely use adequate contraception from
      signing informed consent, during study process and for an additional 18 weeks after the last
      dose of vedolizumab. A male subject who is non-sterilized and sexually active with a female
      partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing informed
      consent throughout the duration of the study and for 18 weeks after the last dose.
