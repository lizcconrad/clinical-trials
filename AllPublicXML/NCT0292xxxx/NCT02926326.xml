      An open-label, single-sequence study to evaluate the effect of azithromycin on BCT197
      exposure in healthy male subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open study conducted in healthy male subjects at a single centre. Each
      subject will participate in a screening visit and 2 study periods. At the first study period,
      all subjects will receive a single dose of BCT197 and at study period 2, all subjects will
      receive 3 daily doses of azithromycin and a single dose of BCT197.
