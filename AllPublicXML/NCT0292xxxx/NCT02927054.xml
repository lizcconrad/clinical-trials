    <textblock>
      A questionnaire was provided, including clinical vignettes and free text answers, to assess
      and evaluate the ability of resident physicians to identify systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and severe sepsis. Questionnaire scores were compared between
      specialties. A whole-hospital educational campaign was provided with the aim to improve
      sepsis recognition, and the questionnaire survey was repeated after one year to assess the
      effect of the education on the recognition of sepsis.

      Sepsis is the number one cause of mortality in US hospitals. An aim of this study was to
      evaluate the ability of resident physicians with different training backgrounds to recognize
      SIRS, sepsis, and severe sepsis. A survey assessment of the definition of SIRS, sepsis, and
      severe sepsis was administered to internal medicine, emergency room, orthopedic,
      neurosurgery, and general surgery residents. Then, an intensive educational campaign designed
      to improve recognition of the patient with sepsis was launched. For approximately 1 year,
      posters with this educational information were displayed in the hospital, one-on-one
      educational sessions were provided to residents, and didactic sessions focusing on sepsis
      were conducted. The survey was then redesigned and administered it to the same groups as
      described previously.
