  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to see if, after tasting specific things, whether a child's facial
      pattern and voice pattern can determine the difference in something that has a sweet taste,
      no taste, and a bitter taste. The investigators will do this by comparing video recordings of
      a child's facial expression and voice to the child's response to follow-up questions after
      tasting three (3) different substances.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will taste three different substances in random order: 1. Prednisone liquid (a
      commonly used medicine to treat swelling which is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration) for use in children; 2. A solution of table sugar in water (simple syrup);
      and 3. Ora-Plus, which is a solution that can be added to medicines. Ora-Plus is considered
      safe for use in children's formulas and all of the ingredients of Ora-Plus are on the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) list. About 1 ml of each
      substance will be placed directly onto the tongue. Each substance will be tasted for 5-10
      seconds and then, expectorated. Participants and investigators recording responses will be
      blinded with regard to the identity of test substances.

      Facial expression will be recorded prior to administration of the taste substances and for
      approximately 2 minutes thereafter. An audio recording of the participant's voice will also
      be made during this time. At about 5 and 10 minutes after a given taste substance is
      administered, participants will be asked to identify a face on a 5-point facial hedonic scale
      which shows the participant's taste perception. Participants will also be asked to describe
      the taste sensation experienced as sweet, bitter or neutral (no apparent taste).

      Participants will have a 30-minute rest period after administration of each taste substance
      which will include the administration of water and a neutral food to enable cleansing of the
      palate. The procedure above will be repeated in the same way for each of the 3 test
      substances.

    <description>The investigators propose that Noldus Facereader 7 can adequately discriminate between bitter, sweet, and neutral tastes in children and adolescents. Data collected through these recordings will be compared to ratings of liking/disliking of liquids using a 5-point facial hedonic scale and compared to a questionnaire after each tasting.</description>

  <biospec_descr>
    <textblock>
      Using a sample of saliva or swabbed buccal mucosa, a given DNA sample will be analyzed for
      allelic variants of a gene (TAS2R38), which controls the expression of the bitter taste
      receptor in each subject. This analysis will be exploratory in nature and its value would be
      to investigate any potential genotype-phenotype discordance in a given participant in
      response to the bitter (Prednisone) test substance. The DNA samples will only be used to
      assess genomic interactions in taste response.

        Study participants will be recruited via IRB approved advertisements and from the ACRI
        database for which subjects have given prior permission to be contacted for research
        studies. A convenience sample will be comprised of 10 children and/or adolescents ranging
        in age from 7 to 16 years of age. A total of 13 subjects may be enrolled in the event that
        a subject is unable to meet criteria and/or needs to withdraw. If the study attains 10
        evaluable subjects, then additional participants will not be enrolled.
