      The purpose of this study is to see if adding Mindfulness training to diabetes education
      reduces feelings of stress and makes it easier to adhere to healthy behaviors that improve
      diabetes outcomes (such as hemoglobin A1c).

      Background: One million Veterans (25%) who receive health care through Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA) have diabetes and are therefore responsible for daily diabetes
      self-management (DSM). DSM is essential for glycemic control and prevention of potentially
      life threatening and disabling complications such as severe hypoglycemia, kidney failure,
      acute coronary syndrome and stroke. Importantly, 40% of individuals with diabetes suffer from
      diabetes-related distress (DRD) that interferes with their ability to sustain healthy
      self-management behaviors, and may be particularly problematic for Veterans who are at higher
      risk for comorbid negative emotional states such as depression and post-traumatic stress
      disorder.

      Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has traditionally contained little content or
      skill-building directly related to stress management, leaving this critical component of
      diabetes self-management largely unaddressed in DSME. In the investigators' pilot work, the
      investigators have developed a brief stress management intervention known as Mind-STRIDE,
      which contains mindfulness training and home practice and is easily integrated into existing
      DSME. While the investigators have previously demonstrated the feasibility, patient
      acceptability, and initial efficacy of Mind-STRIDE, its effects on diabetes-related
      psychological and physiological patient outcomes remain unknown. There is, therefore, a
      critical need to determine the efficacy of this targeted mindfulness intervention for
      improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM behaviors, and metabolic control of Veterans with
      diabetes in order to offer comprehensive, evidence-based DSME that improves Veteran-centric
      diabetes outcomes.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of Mind-STRIDE for
      improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM, and metabolic control, and to characterize
      distinctive Veteran experiences with DRD and Mind-STRIDE.

      Methods: To achieve these objectives, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled
      trial of 126 Veterans at a large VA medical center in southwest PA. Participants will be
      assigned to one of two study conditions: an experimental group that receives routine diabetes
      education plus Mind-STRIDE, or to a usual care group that receives diabetes education alone.
      DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, and DSM will be assessed using self-report questionnaires.
      Metabolic control (Hemoglobin A1c) will be assessed using standard laboratory procedures.
      Data will be collected at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks, and will be analyzed using
      mixed-effects models. Telephone interviews will be conducted at 15-weeks post-intervention in
      a subset of participants from the experimental group, and will be analyzed using modified
      Grounded Theory methods. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be compared and
      interpreted using Convergent Parallel Design.

      Status: The project team is completing study start up activities and will begin recruitment
      in October 2016.

    <measure>Change in Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID) -(measures diabetes-related distress) at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item psychometrically validated self-report questionnaire on a 5 point Likert scale. Higher scores denote higher levels of diabetes related distress. PAID will be administered at 3 times point: baseline, 3 months and 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-efficacy Scale (DSES) at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item psychometrically validated self-report questionnaire on a 10- point Likert Scale (1= Not confident at all; 10 = Totally confident) that measures diabetes self efficacy. Diabetes self-efficacy is a critical pathway to improved self-management and refers to an individual's confidence in their ability to perform health behaviors that influences the behaviors in which they actually engage. DSES will be administered at 3 times point: baseline, 3 months and 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-item psychometrically validated questionnaire on a 6-point Likert scale (1=Almost Always and 6= Never) Higher scores reflect high states of Mindfulness. Mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. MAAS will be administered at 3 times point: baseline, 3 months and 6 months</description>

    <description>A test that measures the level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood as a means of determining the average blood sugar concentrations for the preceding two to three months. All tests will be performed at VAPHS according to national Glyco-hemoglobin Standardization Program approved methods. Hba1c will be measured at 3 times point: baseline, 3 months and 6 months</description>
