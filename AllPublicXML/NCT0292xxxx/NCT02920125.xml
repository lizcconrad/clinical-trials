           plaques; improves functional life

        -  Improvements in Cardiac Function : LVEF; Global perfusion

        -  Rejuvenation of endothelium, vascular function.

        -  Improved physical strength: digestion; GI function; immunity; accelerated internal
           healing

        -  Secondary prevention to avoid incidences in post event treatment.
