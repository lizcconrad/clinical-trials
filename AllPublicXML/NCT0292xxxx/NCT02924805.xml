      Comparison of telemedical prehospital emergency care and conventional on-scene physician
      based care of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The adherence to current Guidelines
      should be researched.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedically guided cases of hypertensive emergencies (april 2014 - March 2015) and
      urgencies are compared with a historical control group of conventional emergency medical
      service physician care on-scene for these scenarios. The historical control group is a time
      period prior to implementation of the telemedicine system and after a research project with a
      precursor telemedicine system. No telemedical support but only conventional on-scene EMS
      physician care was available (November 2013 - March 2014).
