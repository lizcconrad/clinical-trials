        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Healthy men and women (not of child bearing potential) as determined by medical
             history, surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG),
             and clinical laboratory tests including coagulation parameters.

          3. Subjects with body mass index of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive.

          4. Women participants must have documented proof that they are not of childbearing
             potential.

          5. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with BMS-986141 plus 5 half-lives plus
             90 days for a total of 100 days post-treatment completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute or chronic medical illness, subjects with bleeding diathesis, gastrointestinal
             ulcer, hepatic disease.
