      This study will use a traditional cluster randomized crossover design with patients in five
      medical intensive care units at the Cleveland Clinic to evaluate the efficacy of silk-like
      bed sheets and underpads for prevention of Unit-Acquired Pressure Ulcers (UAPU). Adult
      hospitalized patients in beds with standard bed linens versus those with silk-like linens
      will be compared for 1) rate of development of UAPU, 2) time to develop the first UAPU, and
      the maximum severity of any UAPU that develop. Bed linens will be changed per unit protocol.
      Patient characteristics will be summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical
      factors and means, standard deviations, percentiles and median and range for continuous
      measures. For the primary outcome of unit-acquired pressure ulcer rate, generalized linear
      mixed models, assuming a Poisson distribution for the outcome, and unit length of stay as an
      offset will be used. For the time to event analysis, frailty models will be used to assess
      whether time to first pressure ulcer differs between treatment types. Generalized linear
      mixed models will be used for other secondary endpoints, including maximum severity of
      observed pressure ulcers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there has been a large amount of research published on contributing factors to
      pressure ulcers, there has been little research related to the role that bed linens play in
      affecting moisture, friction, and shear that may lead to development of unit-acquired
      pressure ulcers (UAPU) for patients in acute care settings. This study will use a traditional
      cluster randomized crossover design with patients in five medical intensive care units at the
      Cleveland Clinic to evaluate the efficacy of silk-like bed sheets and underpads for
      prevention of Unit-Acquired Pressure Ulcers (UAPU). Nurses will assess all patients on the
      units for three months on the standard bed linens and three months on the silk-like linens.
      For each unit, the order of intervention will be randomized. Adult hospitalized patients in
      beds with standard bed linens versus those with silk-like linens will be compared for 1) rate
      of development of UAPU, 2) time to develop the first UAPU, and the maximum severity of any
      UAPU that develop. Upon entry into the study, all patients will be assessed for baseline skin
      integrity by the admitting nurse. Demographic data (MRN; unit name; type of linen on bed;
      admitting diagnosis; dates of admission/discharge; age; gender; race; weight; Braden score;
      date, location, and stages of UAPU development; lab values (albumin, total protein); and
      categories of the Charlson Comorbidity Index will be recorded on data collection form by
      research nurse. Bed linens will be changed per unit protocol. A sample size of 3456 patients
      is estimated. Patient characteristics will be summarized using frequencies and percentages
      for categorical factors and means, standard deviations, percentiles and median and range for
      continuous measures. Comparisons of these patient characteristics, including Braden score,
      Charlson comorbidity index, unit length of stay and hospital length of stay, will be compared
      between linen types using generalized linear mixed effect models. For the primary outcome of
      unit-acquired pressure ulcer rate, generalized linear mixed models, assuming a Poisson
      distribution for the outcome, and unit length of stay as an offset will be used. In these
      models, linen type and study period will be used as fixed effects and each unit will be
      included as a random effect. For the time to event analysis, frailty models will be used to
      assess whether time to first pressure ulcer differs between treatment types. Generalized
      linear mixed models will be used for other secondary endpoints, including maximum severity of
      observed pressure ulcers.
