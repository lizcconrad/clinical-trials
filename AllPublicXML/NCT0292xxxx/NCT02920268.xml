  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent abdominal pain affects up to 37% of school-age children, mostly girls. These
      problems results in decreased quality-of-life, absence from school, lower sleep quality and
      increased health-care consumption. Long-term effects are lasting pain-symptoms and increased
      risk for psychiatric illness.

      The scientific evidence for interventions towards long-term pain in children is limited and
      pharmacological treatment is not effective. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown some
      effect but is time- and resource consuming. Dance and yoga can enhance positive protective
      factors through better body awareness and increased self-regulation. Relaxation in yoga also
      has positive effect on abdominal pain.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an intervention with dance and yoga for
      girls, 9 to 12 years old, with recurrent abdominal pain. The participants will be identified
      through pediatric clinics in Örebro County, primary health care and school health care. They
      will be randomized to intervention with weekly dance- and yoga class for 8 months or control
      group with standard treatment. Primary outcome is the fraction of girls in each group who,
      direct after intervention, has decreased their maximum pain measured by Faces Pain Scale.
      Secondary outcomes are stress, psychical health, well-being, school and sleep functions,
      physical activity and health-economy. The study group will be followed up for two years.

      Just-in-TIME is an interdisciplinary research group with expertise in interventions for
      psychosomatic problems in children and adolescents. TIME, which stands for Try, Identify,
      Move and Enjoy, also characterizes this project, aiming at decreasing recurrent abdominal
      pain through an intervention with dance and yoga for 9-12 year old girls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Girls born in 2004-2007 (9-12 years) as of pediatricians receive or have received the
        diagnosis functional abdominal pain or IBS according to the ROME III criteria and stating
        that they have persist symptoms for at least 2 months after completed investigation from
        pediatricians. Persistent symptoms are measured by pain diary at baseline and means that
        the girl at least once in the pain diary estimates 4 or higher as measured by the Faces
        Pain Scale (FPS-R).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Simultaneous celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

          -  Difficulties in following verbal instructions such as hearing impaired or mentally
             retarded.

          -  Girls who are deemed to have such serious psychological symptoms that other treatment
             is required. All participants in the study, which estimates over 13 at the Children's
             Depression Screener (Child-S), will meet a psychologist / psychiatrist to assess
             whether they can participate in the study or have direct access to the Children and
             Youth psychiatry.

          -  Children treated with CBT.
