  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cell infiltration of tumor lesions is a known prognostic factor in several tumor types and
      is used as treatment mechanism in some of these tumor types. In metastatic melanoma,
      treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors induces clinical benefit in about 30-50% of the
      patients. These immune-based therapies are however accompanied by serious immune-related
      adverse events and high costs.

      Tumor infiltrating T cells express the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor on their
      surface. These T cells could therefore be visualized by molecular imaging with a
      radio-labelled ligand for this receptor. For this purpose, the investigators have developed
      the PET tracer [18F]FB-IL2.

      The study commences with a biodistribution study (phase 1) in 5 subjects. Thereafter the main
      study (phase 2) starts, in which 25 subjects will receive two [18F]FB-IL2 PET scans at
      baseline and week 6 of treatment with either ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or the
      combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. If [18F]FB-IL2 PET is able to detect a response to
      treatment, it could serve as a non-invasive early indicator of T cell response to the
      treatment. Besides, accumulation of the PET tracer in non-target tissue could indicate
      infiltration of activated T cells in normal organs and thus may predict the development of an
      immune-related adverse event.

    <description>Biodistribution and kinetics will be assessed in the first five patients that participate in this trial (phase 1). A 60-minute dynamic PET scan of the chest and 2 total-body PET scans at 60 and 120 minutes will be acquired to determine tracer kinetics and residence time of the tracer in major organs.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For detection of a treatment-induced immune response the absolute tracer uptake in tumor lesions will be compared between the scan at baseline and the scan after 6 weeks of treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab.</description>

    <measure>Correlation between tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2 with response to therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The increase in tumor uptake of [18F]FB-IL2 ofu the tumor lesions on the PET scan at baseline and week 6 of treatment with immunotherapy, will be correlated to radiological response as measured on the CT scans at week 6, 12 and 16 according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

    <measure>To analyze heterogeneity in immune response to treatment between separate lesions, as determined by [18F]FB-IL2 PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both the heterogeneity between separate lesions in one patient and between lesions in different patients will be determined and if possible will be correlated to treatment response (lesion based).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment induced immune cell activation in non-target tissues and if possible the correlation of PET observations with side effects related to the tissue involved.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment induced immune cell activation in non-target tissue will be determined by visually comparing the PET results at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. In regions with a higher tracer uptake on the week 6 scan the absolute uptake will be determined and this will be correlated to the development of an immune-related adverse event. In case of immune-related side effects localized to the skin or colon, biopsy samples are optional and tissue infiltration of IL2 receptor positive cells can be correlated to [18F]FB-IL2 uptake on PET.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events of [18F]FB-IL2 PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded. Vital signs and blood parameters will be determined before and after tracer injection and directly after the PET scan for safety reasons.</description>
