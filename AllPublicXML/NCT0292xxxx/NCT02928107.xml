  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop evidence that can inform hearing health care best
      practices for adults between the ages of 65-75, and to determine what level of involvement by
      the primary care practitioner (PCP) is required to inform and encourage adults age 65-75 to
      follow through with routine hearing screening. The ultimate goal is to provide information to
      implement changes in health care policy to facilitate accessible and affordable hearing
      health care.

      This project will compare implementation of three PCP-based hearing screening strategies that
      include progressive levels of PCP time and guidance to complete telephone-based hearing
      screening.Those who fail screening go on to a medical referral study and receive (1)
      diagnostic audiological testing and (2) determination of the reliability and validity of
      identification of conditions that should require medical referral prior to hearing aid
      provision (called FDA 'Red Flag' conditions, including conditions such as sudden hearing
      loss, cerumen impaction, conductive hearing loss, dizziness, external deformity, ear
      drainage). Adults between the ages of 65-75 years old who are being seen for a routine
      appointment at a participating Duke primary care site may be eligible to participate.

      The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of subjects in Groups 1 and 2 who dial the
      phone number and complete the test at or within two months of their PCP visit, relative to
      Group 3.

      Secondary outcome measures will be the proportion of subjects in all groups who: a) schedule
      and b) complete the visit for diagnostic audiological testing, and subsequently, c) complete
      a plan for appropriate hearing loss intervention, if indicated, within four months of initial
      hearing screening. Physical exams and procedures associated with this study present no
      significant risk to the participant.These are conducted routinely in the clinical
      setting.There is the potential for loss of confidentiality.

    <ipd_description>A process will be developed to facilitate providing other investigators with access to de-identified data in the format that is most helpful to them. Trial description information, data collection forms, and data structure will be posted on a website after the primary manuscript is published, whichever comes last. Data will be posted to the Data Share Site after publication of the primary manuscript. Until that time, a message will also appear stating that the trial data will be available within two weeks of publication of the primary manuscript.</ipd_description>
