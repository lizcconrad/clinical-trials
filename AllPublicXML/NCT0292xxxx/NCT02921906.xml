  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal diabetes is diagnosed before 6 months of age and causes high blood glucose levels
      due to the pancreas not secreting insulin. Neonatal diabetes can be caused by a change in a
      DNA region called the KCNJ11 gene. KCNJ11 encodes a channel in the pancreas that acts as a
      switch to turn 'on' and 'off' insulin secretion. A change in KCNJ11 results in a faulty
      channel, which keeps insulin secretion 'switched off'. The diabetes can be treated with
      tablets called sulphonylureas that switch the pancreatic channel 'on', allowing it to secrete
      insulin in response to gut hormones called incretins. Previous research has shown that
      patients who switch from insulin to sulphonylureas have better blood glucose control,
      including fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia (glucose dropping too low), and also avoid the need
      for injections. It is thought that serious side effects from sulphonylureas are uncommon in
      KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes. Some patients report low glucose after meals and we think this may
      be because they make too much insulin if they eat a meal with protein but low amounts of
      carbohydrate. The investigators will test this by giving study participants different meals
      and measuring the amount of insulin, glucose and incretin hormone in the blood afterwards.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anecdotal evidence from routine clinical care suggests that patients with
      sulphonylurea-treated KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes, when they eat, may experience mild
      hypoglycaemia if the food consumed lacks carbohydrate. It has been suggested that this may be
      due to regulation of insulin secretion via the incretin pathway as opposed to the classical
      ATP pathway. Therefore the investigators hypothesise that foods with a relatively high
      protein content compared to those with a relatively high carbohydrate content will result in
      excessive insulin secretion and relatively lower glucose values in KCNJ11 patients. This
      would be in contrast to healthy control subjects or subjects with SU-treated T2D where the
      insulin secretion will be moderated by the ambient glucose via the classical ATP pathway. The
      investigators will formally study this hypothesis by comparing the insulin, glucose and
      incretin hormone responses to a high protein meal with a high carbohydrate meal in people
      with KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes, people without diabetes and people with sulphonylurea-treated
      Type 2 Diabetes. To assess whether any effect seen is due to direct stimulation of the beta
      cell by the sulphonylurea itself, people with KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes will also undergo the
      same tests in the fasting state, having taken the sulphonylurea in the absence of any food.
