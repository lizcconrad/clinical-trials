      Evaluation of a new technique of liver retraction for the exposure of the His angle in
      gastric bypass Roux-en-Y surgery.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease of clinical treatment initially, but with precise surgical
      indications regulated by national and international health organizations. Among the surgical
      techniques, the gastric bypass Roux-en-Y is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for its efficiency
      and low morbidity and mortality. In gastric laparoscopic surgery it is necessary to move the
      liver in order to ensure adequate working space and a good view. Conventional laparoscopic
      retractors surgery are generally coarse, require an additional incision for its installation,
      or handling by an assistant during surgery and involve risk of liver injury. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a flexible liver retractor in the exposure of the
      His angle in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. This was a prospective, controlled,
      open and comparative study, with 100 patients randomly divided into two groups (conventional
      and flexible retractor), with medical indication for bariatric surgery. Data were recorded
      during surgery in both groups for comparison of the two hepatic retraction techniques.
