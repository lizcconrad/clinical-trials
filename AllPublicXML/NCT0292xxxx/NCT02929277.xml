    <textblock>
      PASTURE is a birth cohort of children born to farm and non-farm women from rural areas across
      Europe. Five study centres Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France and Finland enrolled 1133
      children (farmers in about half of the children) to study the origins of asthma and atopy and
      to develop potential preventive strategies.

      Previous results show a protective effect of farm exposure on allergic risk by livestock
      contacts and microbial exposures and by raw cow milk consumption in early age.

      PASTURE Part IV is the 10-year follow up of this birth cohort. The primary objective is to
      characterize the allergic phenotype between 6 and 10 years old (asthma and allergic rhinitis)
      and to explain how early age exposures and particularly milk products consumption contribute
      in the process of allergic illness in childhood. A focus on the characterization of the
      protective biologically active components in raw milk and identification of immunological
      mechanisms are involved.
