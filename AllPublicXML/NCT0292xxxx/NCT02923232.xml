      Presbyopes (people who might have a significant loss of their ability to accommodate their
      crystalline lens in the eye) will be recruited to wear a test lens and perform typical
      clinical tests of visual acuity with different luminance levels and viewing distances/angles.

      In the proposed study we plan to recruit presbyopes (people who might have a significant loss
      of their ability to accommodate their crystalline lens in the eye) to wear a test lens and
      perform typical clinical tests of visual acuity with different luminance levels and viewing
      distances/angles. These are similar to the typical examinations conducted for regular contact
      lens wearers. Results of this testing will be used to evaluate the efficacy of test lenses
      and to provide additional information for revision of test lenses. If shown to provide
      adequate eye comfort and intended vision correction, this lens design has the potential of
      allowing tens of millions of presbyopes to adapt to contact lenses and significantly improve
      their vision and well-being.
