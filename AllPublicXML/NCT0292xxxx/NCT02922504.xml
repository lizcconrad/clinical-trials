      A surgical abortion under local anesthesia is potentially painful. A protocol using analgetic
      is systematically used. Also the protocol is relevant , the question of taking care of the
      pain in a safe manner remains.

      The use of Music during surgery can have a real effect on pain and anxiety. This study has
      for goal to evalued the use of music on pain as adjuvant treatement instead of a standard

      A surgical abortion under local anesthesiac is potentially painful. A protocol using
      analgetic is systematically used. Also the protocol is relevant, the question of taking care
      of the pain in a safe manner remains.

      The use of Music during surgery can have a real effect on pain and anxiety. This study has
      for goal to evalued the use of music on pain as adjuvant treatment instead of a standard care
      for an abortion.

      The number of patients needed is estimate to be seventy five patients per group.

      The result of the study could allow :

        -  Showing the effectiveness of music intervention as adjuvant treatment on the pain,
           anxiety and nausea during a surgical abortion by suction aspiration under local
           anesthesia.

        -  Improving the experience of an abortion and the satisfaction of the patients as well as
           lowering the use of drugs.
