    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for ALK-positive or
      ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The following drug will be involved in this study :

        -  Lorlatinib

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The FDA (the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Lorlatinib as a treatment for any disease.

      All participants in this study will receive Lorlatinib. Lorlatinib targets the abnormal ALK
      or ROS1 proteins in NSCLC cells. Lorlatinib has been tested in other research studies and
      results show that the medicine may help to control the growth of NSCLC even after it has
      spread to the CNS. The CNS is a term used to refer to the brain and spinal cord, including
      the lining of the brain and spinal cord which is called the meninges.

      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether lorlatinib is
      effective in controlling the growth of cancer cells after they have spread to the CNS.
      Another purpose of this study is to determine why the cancer cells that have spread to the
      participant CNS have continued to grow despite treatment with other drugs. For this reason,
      blood samples will be collected as part of this study to assess the DNA released by the
      participants cancer cells into their blood when the cells travel to other sites in their
      body.

                  pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator's

                  least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment
                  period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception.

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of
                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom
                  and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.
                  Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.

               -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception
                  (e.g., condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the
                  last dose of study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this
                  same period

               -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for
                  the duration of the pregnancy.

               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception.

        study.
