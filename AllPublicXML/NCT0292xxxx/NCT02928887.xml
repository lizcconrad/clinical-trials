      The goal of this study is to determine whether or not exposure to blue spectrum light reduces
      acute kidney injury and systemic inflammation in subjects undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
      Subjects scheduled to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will be exposed to either bright
      (1000 lux) blue spectrum (480nm) light or to ambient, white fluorescent light for a 24 hour
      photoperiod the day prior to surgery and for a 24 hour photoperiod in the immediate
      postoperative period.

      Light modifies the biology and physiology of mammals, including humans. The cellular biology
      of both the immune system, as well as, the cells comprising tissues and organs (e.g., kidney,
      liver) are under the regulation of light and exhibit circadian rhythms. Studies show that the
      severity of organ injury varies with the time of the day, the duration of the day, and the
      season. This variation is due to the biology of circadian rhythms, and light is the principle
      environmental cue entraining circadian biology. More recent data suggest that modulating the
      spectrum of light to which an organism is exposed may therapeutically modulate the cellular
      response to stress or injury. Specifically, exposure to a short (24 hour) photoperiod of high
      illuminance, blue spectrum light attenuated liver and kidney injury when animals were
      subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), a model in which the blood flow to an organ is
      temporarily reduced and then restored. A predominant cause of organ injury in this model is
      the misdirected and exacerbated inflammation of a type of immune cell called the neutrophil.
      However, blue light inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic kidney and liver, and
      thereby reduced inflammation and neutrophil-mediated organ injury.

      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery is an operation characterized by excessive inflammation
      and a high risk of organ injury, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). Thus, we hypothesize
      that exposure to blue light, by comparison to standard environmental, white fluorescent
      light, will reduce inflammation, organ injury and improve the outcome of patients undergoing
      CPB.
