  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the non-inferiority of oral flucloxacillin
      alone compared with a combination of oral flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin for the
      emergency department directed outpatient treatment of cellulitis, wound infections and
      abscesses, recently renamed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as acute bacterial skin
      and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Half of the trial participants will receive
      flucloxacillin and placebo in combination, and the remaining half will be treated will
      flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin.

      In a secondary objective the trial aims to measure adherence and persistence of trial
      patients with outpatient antibiotic therapy. In addition a within-trial evaluation of the
      cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the use of oral flucloxacillin
      compared with combination therapy from the perspective of the health-care payer (direct
      costs) the patient and government. Finally the study will externally validate the Extremity
      Soft Tissue Infection-score, a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaire designed
      to quantify the impact of cellulitis, wound infections and abscesses on patient HRQL in
      clinical trials.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is obvious clinical equipoise between the use of oral flucloxacillin alone or combined
      with phenoxymethylpenicillin for the emergency department treatment of cellulitis, wound
      infections and abscesses as evidenced by current disparate prescribing practice and hospital
      guidelines. Feasibility studies for the planned trial have shown that 45-50% of emergency
      department patients with these infections in Ireland are discharged on oral antibiotics which
      is consistent with findings in other jurisdictions. Despite the significant healthcare and
      economic costs associated with cellulitis, there is a paucity of scientific evidence
      concerning the appropriate antibiotic treatment for these conditions. Additionally, &quot;less
      severe&quot; infections tend to be over-treated and severe infections under-treated, indicating
      unjustifiable levels of antibiotic misuse, insufficient knowledge of therapeutics and a lack
      of evidence to risk-stratify patients with cellulitis to different treatments.The planned
      trial is therefore likely to be definitive due to the current clinical equipoise between the
      use of both penicillins for the emergency department outpatient treatment of this group of
      infections
