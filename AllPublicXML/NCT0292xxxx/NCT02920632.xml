    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of an eight-week online cognitive training program on
      objective and subjective cognitive functions in Parkinson's disease. Moreover, we intend to
      map the effect on brain network function, and if cognitive training can prevent the
      development of PD-MCI/PD-D after one- and two-year follow-up. In this study, two training
      groups will be compared (N: 70 vs 70). In a part of the participants MRI will be assessed (N:
      40 vs. 40). We expect cognitive training to improve cognitive functions, and to improve the
      efficiency of brain network function. Moreover, we expect that cognitive training can
      decrease the risk of PD-MCI/PD-D at one- and two-year follow-up.

      BACKGROUND In Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive dysfunction is frequently reported -
      approximately 50% of PD patients experience cognitive impairment (Litvan et al., 2011). Of
      these impairments, executive dysfunction is most frequently reported early in the disease
      trajectory (Bosboom, Stoffers, &amp; Wolters, 2004; Muslimovic, Post, Speelman, &amp; Schmand, 2005),
      while impairments in other cognitive domains (i.e. attention, episodic memory, visuospatial
      functions) are also highly prevalent (Bosboom et al., 2004). The majority of PD patients
      ultimately develops PD dementia (PD-D; Aarsland, Andersen, Larsen, Lolk, &amp; Kragh-Sorensen,
      2003; Hely, Reid, Adena, Halliday, &amp; Morris, 2008). Moreover, about 10% of the PD patients
      develops PD-D every year (Aarsland &amp; Kurz, 2010). Cognitive dysfunctions in PD have a
      significant negative influence on the quality of life (Klepac, Trkulja, Relja, &amp; Babic,
      2008), while treatment of these dysfunctions is in its infancy.

      Cognitive training may provide a new intervention for reducing cognitive complaints and
      delaying the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or PD-D. This intervention has been
      widely studied in other diseases (Cicerone et al., 2011; Olazaran et al., 2010). Moreover,
      studies have provided evidence not only for behavioral influences, but also for brain
      connectivity and activity effects of cognitive training (Chapman et al., 2015; Castellanos et
      al., 2010; Subramaniam et al., 2012; Subramaniam et al., 2014; Belleville et al., 2011;
      Rosen, Sugiura, Kramer, Whitfield-Gabrieli, &amp; Gabrieli, 2011). This suggests a restorative
      effect of cognitive training on disrupted brain networks.

      In PD, cognitive dysfunction - mainly executive dysfunction - is associated with disruption
      of the cortico-striato-thalamo-corticale circuits by depletion of dopamine. Dysfunction of
      these circuits seems to disrupt several cognitive networks, which leads to cognitive
      dysfunction (Baggio et al., 2014). Cognitive training could counteract these disruptions by
      normalising activity and connectivity, and ultimately lead to a reduction of impairment.
      Since earlier studies in different patient populations have shown that cognitive training has
      lasting effects (Petrelli et al., 2015), normalising disruptions underlying cognitive
      impairment could prevent cognitive deterioration and therefore prevent or delay the
      development of PD-D.

      Few studies in PD have focused on cognitive training and its neural correlates. A
      meta-analysis by Leung et al. (2015) showed positive effects of cognitive training on mainly
      'frontal' cognitive functions (i.e. working memory, executive functions, processing speed).
      In addition, earlier research has described a neuroprotective effect of cognitive training on
      the development of MCI in PD (odds ratio: 3; Petrelli et al., 2015). Until now, however,
      studies have been relatively small and mainly without a controlled design - consequently,
      there is a need for large randomized controlled studies (Hindle, Petrelli, Clare, &amp; Kalbe,
      2013; Leung et al., 2015). Moreover, neural effects of cognitive training are largely unknown
      in PD. Furthermore, it is important to study the improvement of patients on daily functioning
      after cognitive training, rather than solely focusing on cognitive tasks and neural measures.
      Finally, cognitive training has been performed mainly in hospital settings, while PD patients
      have mobility problems - a training method suitable to perform from home is therefore needed
      for this population.

      OBJECTIVES The study objective is primarily to measure the effect of an online cognitive
      training in patients with mild cognitive complaints in PD. An online training, specifically
      altered for PD patients (BrainGymmer) will be compared with an active comparator. In both
      conditions, participants will train eight weeks, three times a week during 45 minutes.

      Primary objective:

      - To measure the effect of an online cognitive training (as compared to the active
      comparator), eight weeks, three times a week, on executive functions in patients with mild
      cognitive complaints in PD.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To measure the effect of online cognitive training on daily functioning.

        -  To measure the endurance of the training effect after six months, one and two years.

        -  To assess the reduced risk of MCI and PD-D development by cognitive training.

        -  To assess the effect of cognitive training on brain network efficiency and connectivity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjective cognitive complaints, measured by the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive
             Functional Rating Scale score &gt; 3 (PD-CFRS). A score above 3 indicates significant
             cognitive complaints, that are milder than complaints associated with Parkinson's
             disease dementia. This questionnaire is filled in by the patient.

          -  Participants' Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage is lower than 4. Patients are stable on dopaminergic
             medication at least a month before starting the intervention. During the intervention,
             patient and neurologist will be asked to keep the dopaminergic medication dosage as
             stable as possible.

          -  Participants have access to a computer or tablet, with access to the Internet. If the
             participant uses a computer, he or she is capable of using a keyboard and computer
             mouse.

          -  Participants are willing to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General criteria:

          -  Indications for a dementia syndrome, measured by the Self-administered Gerocognitive
             Examination score &lt; 14 or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 22.

          -  Current drug- or alcohol abuse, measured by a score &gt; 1 on the four CAGE AID-questions
             (according to the Trimbos guidelines).

          -  The inability to undergo extensive neuropsychological assessment, or eight weeks of
             intervention.

          -  Moderate to severe depressive symptoms, as defined by the Beck Depression Inventory
             score &gt; 18.

          -  An impulse control disorder, including internet addiction, screened by the impulse
             control disorder criteria interview.

          -  Psychotic symptoms, screened by the Questionnaire for Psychotic Experiences. Benign
             hallucinations with insight are not contraindicated.

          -  Traumatic brain injury, only in case of a contusio cerebri with 1) loss of
             consciousness for &gt; 15 minutes and 2) posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 1 hour.

          -  A space occupying lesion defined by a radiologist, or significant vascular
             abnormalities (Fazekas &gt; 1).

        For participation in MRI research:

          -  Severe claustrophobia

          -  Metal in the body (for example, deep brain stimulator or pacemaker)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Problems with or shortness of breath during 60 minutes of lying still.
