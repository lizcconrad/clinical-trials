  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to document the clinical efficacy and complications of
      endoscopic pyloromyotomy in patients with refractory gastroparesis (diabetic, post-operative
      and idiopathic), compared to Botulinic toxin injection intra-pyloric the results of which are
      close to the placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a functional disease affecting 4% of the population, which is consecutive to
      diabetes in 30% of cases and considerably alters the patients' quality of life. The diagnosis
      is based on gastric fullness symptoms, endoscopy and gastric emptying scintigraphy. The
      therapeutic alternatives including drug therapies (Metoclopramide, Erythrocin), surgery
      (Electric gastric stimulation) or endoscopy (Botulinic toxin), are insufficiently effective.
      Two surgical series suggested an interesting efficacy of laparoscopic pyloroplasty, which
      remains invasive for a motility disorder. More recently, an US team performed the first case
      of G-POEM with an excellent outcome and no adverse event. This promising result was confirmed
      by a Brazilian case, a short retrospective series (7 patients) and the first European case
      performed and published by our team that has performed 5 cases since. Based on experience, it
      is proposed a prospective monocentric study to evaluate the efficacy of the G-POEM technique
      on refractory gastroparesis. This study will include 40 patients on a period of three years,
      whom suffer from refractory gastroparesis, confirmed by clinical evaluation (GCSI and
      analogic visual scale), upper GI endoscopy and gastric emptying scintigraphy at the
      inclusion.
