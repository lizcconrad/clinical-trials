  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics prescribed by dentists may contribute to the larger national issue of the
      use and abuse of the drug. On occasion dental pain may be sufficiently severe to support the
      use of opioids. This study used both dentist and patient input to evaluate the use of opioid
      and over-the-counter analgesics following one of seven coded common dental procedures. The
      study includes a five day patient follow up assessment of the effectiveness of the analgesic.
      Baseline questionnaires were completed by eligible participants, and they responded to the
      day 5 follow up questionnaires.

      Specific Aims The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine (1) the pattern of
      analgesic prescriptions (Rx and OTC) and recommendations (OTC) in dental practices; and (2)
      the effectiveness of and side effects associated with these medications as measured by
      patientreported outcomes (PROs).

      Specific Aim 1: To document (a) dentists' postprocedural prescriptions and recommendations
      for analgesic medication: and (b) the effectiveness of these medications and side effects
      associated with their use as measured by PROs.

      Specific Aim 2: To analyze by procedure class and anticipated pain severity the PROs of Rx
      and OTC analgesic medications.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the incidence of analgesic side effects of Rx and OTC analgesic
      medications.

      The outcomes of Specific Aims 1-3 will be:

        -  The distribution of dentists' Rx/OTC prescriptions/recommendations by dentists for
           anticipated pain severity.

        -  The effectiveness of different types of Rx and OTC analgesics (e.g., Rx NSAIDs vs. OTC
           NSAIDs, Rx NSAIDs vs. Rx narcotics) by procedure class and anticipated pain severity.

        -  The incidence of analgesic side effects for Rx and OTC analgesics. Analysis of the
           results and methods of the proposed research will furthermore serve as guidance in
           designing a randomized PBRN clinical trial comparing the efficacy of and complications
           associated with two or more analgesics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of erupted second molar teeth.

          2. Scheduled for treatment in one procedure of the following six procedure classes:

             extraction, endodontic therapy, pulp capping, crown preparation, periodontal surgery,
             abscess treatment

          3. Expected by the P-I to experience postoperative pain sufficient to require an
             analgesic

          4. Permanent dentition (erupted 2nd molar teeth)

          5. Capacity to judge pain level

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Under treatment for medical disorders, including dementia, Parkinson's disease,
             depression, severe anxiety, or any other medical condition, that, in the opinion of
             the P-I, would affect the subject's judgment of postoperative pain

          2. Current participation in another dental or medical research study.
