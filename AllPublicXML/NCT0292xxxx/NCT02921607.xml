  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to define a set of clinical pathways for heart failure patients, reflecting the
      period from prior to admission to the post-discharge period following hospitalisation, under
      the current system that exists at the two clinical sites [as mentioned previously, the main
      site is at St Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin, but to ensure generalizability the
      project team will also carry out similar work Portsmouth Hospital, United Kingdom]. These
      pathways have been drawn up using the experience of the clinical investigators, using an
      interactive workshop approach and a pilot study.

        1. Pre-Admission Pathway

        2. Emergency Department Pathway

        3. In-Hospital management Pathway

        4. Pre-discharge Pathway

        5. Post-Discharge Pathway

      During identification of these pathways, the research team identified the settings/personnel
      that require study to more fully comprehend the methods, strengths and weaknesses of the
      present processes. Study activities are focused on two aspects of the patient journey,
      immediately before discharge and three months post discharge during the outpatient phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a significant public health issue with a prevalence of over 2%, and is among
      the leading causes of hospital admission worldwide, particularly in those over-65 years.
      Patients with heart failure frequently require acute hospitalisation and are at increased
      risk of mortality (more than half of heart failure patients will die within five years of
      initial diagnosis, American Heart Association). The high hospital admission rate and
      readmission reduce quality of life and significantly drive up the costs of health care
      provision for these patients. Moreover, there is a high variability in the reported
      readmission rates across institutions and countries, indicating that the structure of health
      care delivery is variable and of significant importance to outcome in this population. This
      study sets out to investigate the most clinically effective and cost- efficient method of
      delivering care to patients with heart failure focusing on the phase immediately before
      hospital admission, the hospital stay and the immediate discharge period, through analysis of
      the current standards of practice in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.
