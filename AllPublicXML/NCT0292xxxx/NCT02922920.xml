    <textblock>
      Tart cherries are a rich source of antioxidants. Studies have shown that tart cherries exert
      anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of this study is to learn about
      the effects of drinking tart cherry juice on cardiovascular and cognitive health.

    <textblock>
      Thirty-seven older adults were randomly assigned to drink 16 oz per day of either tart cherry
      juice or placebo drink for 12 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline and
      12 weeks to assess biomarkers. Physical activity and 3-day diet records were also collected
      throughout the study.
