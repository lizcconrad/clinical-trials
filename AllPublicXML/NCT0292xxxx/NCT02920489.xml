    <textblock>
      Neuraxial analgesia is the gold standard to relieve labor pain. A recent &quot;Practice guidelines
      for obstetric anesthesia&quot; suggests that neuraxial analgesia should be provided in the early
      stage of labor (cervical dilation &lt; 5 cm) or on a individualized basis. The purpose of this
      randomized controlled trial is to investigate whether neuraxial labor analgesia administered
      on an individualized basis can improve analgesia quality and maternal satisfaction.

      Neuraxial analgesia is the gold standard to relieve labor pain. It also helps to attenuate
      maternal anxiety and improve maternal satisfaction. A recent &quot;Practice guidelines for
      obstetric anesthesia&quot; suggests that neuraxial analgesia should be provided in the early stage
      of labor (cervical dilation &lt; 5 cm) or, for some special patients, be provided on a
      individualized basis. Studies showed that, when compared with late administration, early
      administration of labor analgesia resulted in equivocal findings for spontaneous,
      instrumented, and cesarean delivery. The investigators hypothesize that neuraxial labor
      analgesia provided on an individualized basis will further improve analgesia quality and
      maternal satisfaction. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate
      whether neuraxial labor analgesia administered on an individualized basis can improve
      analgesia quality and maternal satisfaction.

    <description>Epidural catheterization will be performed after the beginning of the first stage of labor. Epidural analgesia will begin when asked by parturients and the numeric rating scale of pain is 5 or higher. A loading dose (10 ml mixture of 0.1% ropivacaine and 0.5 ug/ml sufentanil) will be administered through the epidural catheter. After a 20-minute observation, a patient-controlled analgesia pump (containing a mixture of 0.08% ropivacaine and 0.4 ug/ml sufentanil) will be connected to the epidural catheter and programmed to deliver a 6-ml bolus with a 20-minute lockout interval and a 4 ml/h background infusion. Analgesia will be terminated at the end of the third stage of labor.</description>

A loading dose (10 ml mixture of 0.1% ropivacaine and 0.5 ug/ml sufentanil) will be administered through the epidural catheter. After a 20-minute period observation, a patient-controlled analgesia pump (containing a mixture of 0.08% ropivacaine and 0.4 ug/ml sufentanil) will be connected to the epidural catheter and programmed to deliver a 6-ml bolus with a 20-minute lockout interval and a 4 ml/h background infusion.
