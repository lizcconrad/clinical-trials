    <textblock>
      In this study, people who suffer from strong self-critical tendencies will be randomized to
      two study conditions. The first group receives an account to an internet-based self-help
      intervention. The second group is a waiting control group. In both conditions additional care
      or treatment is allowed. The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of an
      internet-based self-help intervention on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms compared to
      a waiting list. Assessments are at baseline, 8-week and 6-months post-randomization. After 8
      weeks, participants in the waiting control group get also access to the intervention and fill
      out questionnaires after 8 weeks again.
