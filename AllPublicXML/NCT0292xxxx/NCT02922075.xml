      This study evaluates the impact of soft tissue grafts on soft tissue recession following
      immediate implant, provisional and bone graft placement in compromised sockets. One third of
      the patients received a collagen matrix (CM group), another third received a connective
      tissue graft removed from the palate (CTG group) and the final third did not receive any soft
      tissue graft (CTL group).

      Preventing soft tissue recession following flapless immediate implant and provisional
      placement (IIPP) in sockets with facial bone dehiscences is a challenge, mainly in esthetic
      areas. This study evaluated the impact of soft tissue grafts on peri-implant alterations
      after 1-year follow-up. Twenty-four patients with one single failing maxillary incisor
      presenting facial bone dehiscence and receiving IIPP were randomly divided in three groups
      (n= 8 in each group): Control (CTL); Collagen Matrix (CM); Connective tissue graft (CTG). In
      addition to soft tissue grafts, all groups were treated with collagen membrane and
      deproteinized bovine bone mineral containing 10% of porcine collagen. Clinical, photographic
      and tomographic analyses were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months after surgery to
      evaluate tissue alterations.
