  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the impact of an e-learning course in neuromuscular monitoring on the frequency of
      application of objective neuromuscular monitoring for assessment of depth of neuromuscular
      blockade in general anaesthesia and secondarily on the incidence of residual neuromuscular
      blockade after anesthesia.

      We will collect data prospectively from 6 Danish anaesthesia departments from the time of
      intervention, using data from the Anaesthesia Information Management System (AIMS). Baseline
      data is obtained from another study based on the same data extraction procedure
      (NCT02914119).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Departments We will include the 6 largest anaesthesia departments in the Zealand
        Region of Denmark.

        Anaesthetists We will include the following anaesthesia personnel as anaesthetists: nurse
        anaesthetists in training, nurse anaesthetists, first year residents in anaesthesiology,
        residents in the last 4 years of training in anaesthesiology, and specialist consultants in
        anaesthesia.

        Patients We will include and collect data from all patients undergoing general anaesthesia
        with neuromuscular blockade in each data collection period. Patients, who are eligible more
        than once, i.e. undergoing general anaesthesia on more than one occasion, will be included
        in the analyses with a case for every general anaesthetic received.

        Exclusion criteria We will exclude personnel without clinical functions, i.e.
        administrative personnel.
