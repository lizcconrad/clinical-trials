  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate Aftobetin-HCl and florescence detection as measured
      by the Sapphire II device.

      Performance of Part I of the study has been completed (15 subjects received a single
      administration of Aftobetin HCL followed by Sapphire II measurements) and indicated that 3
      administrations of Aftobetin-HCl are necessary. For Part II, a second group of up to 30
      subjects (CN =10 and mild AD or MCI =20) will receive three Aftobetin HCL administrations. If
      three administrations of Aftobetin HCL are optimal, up to an additional 30 MCI and 30 mild AD
      subjects will be entered.

      The purpose of the study as Part II is performed is to determine the ability of the Sapphire
      II device to detect B-amyloid in the lens of the eye in subjects with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI), and mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) after three Aftobetin-HCl
      administrations. Subjects with Normal Cognition (CN) will also be tested to further establish
      that subjects who are highly unlikely to have B-amyloid deposits in the lens of the eye will
      have close to baseline post ligand fluorescent uptake value (FUV) using the Sapphire II
      technology.

      Open label study. 45-105 subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Complete physical and neurologic examination (Screening)

        -  Neuropsychological testing (Screening)

        -  Ophthalmologic examination (Screening and Visit 4 (Safety follow up visit))

        -  Administration of ointment - 3 administrations (Visit 1)

        -  Sapphire II Fluorescent Eye Measurements (Visits 1-3): Prior to first administration of
           ointment and then 24 +/- 2 hours, 28 +/- 30 minutes and 48 +/- 2 hours following first
           ointment administration

        -  Amyvid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Amyloid Scan (only required for MCI and mild
           AD subjects who have not had a positive amyloid PET scan in the last 3 years)

      Subjects will also be asked to participate in an elective second Sapphire II assessment to
      assess its reproducibility. Repeatability testing is optional and will require a separate
      consent. Subjects will come back for Visits 5-9 (ointment administration and eye scans and a
      follow up safety assessment).
