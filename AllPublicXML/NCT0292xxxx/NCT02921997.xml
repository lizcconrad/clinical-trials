    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted,
      prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18
      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine given with and without
      AS03 adjuvant, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v
      virus vaccine. The primary objectives include assessing the serum anti-HA
      hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A, identifying differentially
      expressed genes in human immune cells, and identifying differentially abundant cellular
      proteins in human immune cells.

      This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted,
      prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18
      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi
      Pasteur given with and without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and an
      intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine
      manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. The primary objectives include assessing the serum anti-HA
      hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without
      adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9
      vaccine ± AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v antigen at Day 29, identifying differentially expressed
      genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29, and identifying differentially abundant
      cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29. The secondary objectives are to
      compare plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles at specific time points and between treatment
      arms at post vaccination points, assess the neutralizing antibody responses to influenza
      A/H7N9 antigen, identify differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4,
      and 8 following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v , and identifying differentially
      abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8 following one
      intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v vaccine compared to baseline assessments performed
      prior to study vaccination.

        a. As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated based
        on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or
        conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, that would affect
        the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.
        Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This
        includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of
        deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
        enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
        insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
        class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any
        change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by
        the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a
        deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
        medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
        reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or
        condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are
        acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition
        that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or
        interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal,
        and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the
        Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.1.2)), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are
        permitted.
