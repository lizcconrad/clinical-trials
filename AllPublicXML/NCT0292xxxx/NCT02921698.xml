        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is aged ≥18 years

          2. Patient has an unruptured or recanalized intracranial aneurysm :

               -  for which an endovascular treatment has been determined appropriate

               -  that can not be treated by standard techniques (coiling with or without
                  remodeling)

               -  and for which the FRED® Flow Diverter has been determined an appropriate
                  treatment

          3. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative has been informed about the
             confidentiality of the study and agrees to the collection of his/her personal data

          4. Patient presents with an mRS score between 0 and 2

          5. Patients who have already been treated with a stent or a flow diverter for another
             aneurysm may be included if:

               -  the previous treatment was more than three months prior to enrollment in this
                  study

               -  the aneurysm to be treated for this study is a new aneurysm located on a
                  different parent vessel unless the stent already in place is implanted on the
                  proximal carotid artery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a known allergy to antiplatelet therapy, heparin and/or contrast medium

          2. Patient has contraindication to antiplatelet therapy and/or heparin

          3. Patient is pregnant and/or breastfeeding

          4. Patient may not benefit from imaging and clinical monitoring

          5. Patient has a medical or surgical co-morbidities limiting his/her life expectancy to
             less than 1 year

          6. Patient will be treated with a flow diverter other than FRED®

          7. Patient had an intracranial hemorrhage within the 30 days preceding treatment

          8. Patient has an aneurysm(s) with one or more of the following characteristics:

               -  associated with an arteriovenous malformation

               -  dissecting or &quot;&quot;blister-like&quot;&quot;

               -  multiple (unless only one aneurysm requires treatment)

               -  located in the posterior circulation

               -  treated with a stent or a flow diverter on the same parent vessel (excluding
                  proximal carotid artery) or in the 3 months prior to inclusion

          9. Patient has stenosis of the aneurysm parent artery.
