  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carnosine, a naturally-occurring dipeptide (β-alanyl-L-histidine) first described in 1900 by
      Gulewitsch and Amiradzibi, is found predominantly in post-mitotic tissues (e.g. brain and
      innervated muscle) of vertebrates . Carnosine is claimed to decrease oxygen free-radical
      mediated damage to cellular macromolecules either by chelating divalent cations or scavenging
      hydroxy radicals with its imidazole moiety. Free-radical damage is not the only process to
      affect the structure of proteins and nucleic acids.

      To the best of our knowledge, no previous study assessed the role of carnosine in diabetes
      associated complications in particular diabetic nephropathy and there is insufficient
      evidence to recommend its supplementation in those patients. Therefore, this study was
      undertaken to investigate the role of carnosine as an adjuvant therapy for diabetic
      nephropathy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and assess its relation to
      microalbuminuria, tubulointerstitial damage marker, glycemic control and oxidative stress.
