      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the bleselumab regimen (basiliximab
      induction, tacrolimus, steroids and bleselumab) compared with the Standard of Care (SOC)
      regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) in the
      prevention of recurrent Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (rFSGS) defined as nephrotic range
      proteinuria with protein-creatinine ratio (≥ 3.0 g/g) through 3 months post-transplant.
      Death, graft loss or lost to follow-up will be imputed as rFSGS.

      The study will consist of the following periods: Screening (Days -21 to -1), Transplant (Day
      0), Post-Transplant (Day 0/post-skin closure through 12 months post-transplant). All subjects
      will enter into a Screening Period (Days -21 to -1 prior to transplant), undergo a Transplant
      (Day 0 [zero]), and are then to be followed for up to 12 months in the Post-Transplant Period
      (Day 0 through 12 months post-transplant).

    <measure>Recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defined as nephrotic range proteinuria with protein-creatinine ratio (≥ 3.0 g/g) through 3 months post-transplant. Deaths, graft loss and lost to follow-up will be imputed as rFSGS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>All episodes of kidney dysfunction based on clinical signs and symptoms will be evaluated by a biopsy at the local pathological laboratory for recurrence of FSGS and for possible rejection. The same slides and images of the biopsy will also be sent to a central pathology lab and read by an independent pathologist to determine recurrence of FSGS.</description>

    <measure>Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (Banff Grade ≥ 1, local read)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>All episodes of kidney dysfunction based on clinical signs and symptoms will be evaluated for possible rejection. All subjects should have biopsy confirmation of rejection before treatment is begun or within 48 hours of initiation of treatment for acute rejection. The pathologist at the clinical site will grade all biopsies using the 2007 Banff criteria (Grading of Acute Kidney Allograft Rejection). Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR, T- or B-cell) will be determined by local review.</description>

    <measure>Biopsy-proven (blinded, central read) rFSGS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Biopsy-proven rFSGS will include only those for whom slides are reviewed by the independent pathologist who will be the blinded, central reader. All subjects are required to provide a biopsy either after the appearance of symptoms for rejection or rFSGS, or at the day 90/month 3 visit, if there has not been a previous biopsy indicating rFSGS in the transplanted kidney. The blinded, central reader will objectively assess podocyte changes to identify those with rFSGS.</description>

             Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) criteria. (A kidney that meets either ECD OR DCD

          -  Subject has significant liver disease, defined as having during the past 21 days
             consistently elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) levels greater than 1.5 times the upper value of the
