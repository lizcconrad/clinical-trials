  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) is devastating outcome for some patients
      with epilepsy. It ranks second only to stroke among neurological diseases in years of
      potential life lost. Patho-mechanisms of SUDEP remain not well understood, however peri-ictal
      respiratory dysfunction likely plays an important role in many cases.

      Literature supports a critical role for the serotonergic system in central control of
      ventilation. Serotonin neurons in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem sense rising carbon
      dioxide and low pH, thereby stimulating breathing and arousal. These responses may serve as
      mechanisms that protect against asphyxia, particularly during sleep or the post-ictal state.
      In mouse models of seizure-induced sudden death, pre-treatment with selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) agents prevents death following seizures. Hence, the investigators
      hypothesize that a subset of drug resistant epilepsy patients who have impaired central
      chemo-responsiveness have a greater degree of peri-ictal respiratory depression, therefore a
      higher risk of SUDEP. The investigators further hypothesize that fluoxetine will improve
      central chemo-responsiveness and therefore will reduce peri-ictal respiratory depression.
