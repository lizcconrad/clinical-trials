  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily involving the colon and has
      long been considered to be due to a dysregulated immune response targeting the colon, and
      involves unknown environmental factors. Currently, no effective therapy targets the
      microbiota or its interaction with the colonic epithelium. Diet has a significant impact on
      the composition of the microbiota; however, no dietary intervention to date has proven
      effective for induction of remission. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      whether the Ulcerative Colitis Diet (UCD) can induce remission or response in pediatric UC
      patients with active mild to moderate UC on a stable medication.
