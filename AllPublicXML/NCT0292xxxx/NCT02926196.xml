    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized trial of the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab as adjuvant or
      post-neoadjuvant treatment for high-risk triple negative breast cancer patients. The overall
      protocol-defined patient population will include the following two strata of patients:

        -  Stratum A - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery
           of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and (if indicated) radiotherapy.

        -  Stratum B - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery of the primary tumor and (if indicated)
           radiotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      -  to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS)
           compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer
           (all comers, unselected for PD-L1 status) who have completed treatment with curative
           intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if
           indicated) radiotherapy.

        -  to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS)
           compared to observation in PD-L1-positive (as determined by a companion diagnostic test
           under development) patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who
           have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor,
           neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy.

        -  to determine whether Avelumab improves overall survival (OS) compared to observation in
           patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed
           treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant
           chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy.

        -  to assess the overall safety of Avelumab administered as adjuvant treatment in patients
           with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with
           curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy,
           and (if indicated) radiotherapy.

             while she or her partner is participating in this trial, the treating physician should
             be informed immediately).

         10. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria Stratum A (Adjuvant patients)

          1. Non-metastatic, histologically confirmed primary invasive breast carcinoma

          2. Triple negative breast cancer: hormone receptor negative (ER &lt; 10% and PgR &lt; 10%) and
             HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH non-amplified), as defined by the local pathology
             laboratory. In case of discordance between pre-operative core-biopsy and the surgical
             sample, the receptor assessment performed on the surgical sample has to be considered
             for inclusion criteria evaluation.

          3. Availability of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block containing tumor tissue or
             at least 7 unstained tumor slides.

          4. Adequately excised: patients must have undergone either breast-conserving surgery or
             mastectomy/nipple- or skin-sparing mastectomy. The margins of the resected specimen
             should be free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (no ink on tumor). In
             the case of breast-conserving surgery patients with margins positive for lobular
             carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection. For patients who
             undergo mastectomy, patients with a microscopic positive deep margin are eligible,
             provided they have received radiotherapy on chest wall.

          5. Pathological node staging (Union for International Cancer Control-American Joint
             Committee on Cancer [UICC/AJCC] 7th edition): patients must have had axillary lymph
             node dissection for evaluation of pathologic nodal status. Only patients with &gt; 4
             metastatic axillary node will be eligible (&gt;pN2).

        Inclusion criteria:

        Stratum B (Post-neoadjuvant patients)

          1. Non-metastatic histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma.

          2. Triple negative breast cancer: hormone receptor negative (ER &lt; 10% and PgR &lt; 10%) and
             HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH non-amplified), as defined by the local pathology
             laboratory. Both the diagnostic core-biopsy performed prior to neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy and the residual disease assessed on the surgical specimen should show a
             triple negative receptor status, as defined by the protocol. Patients with discordant
             triple negative status will not be eligible.

          3. Adequately excised: patients should have undergone adequate tumor excision after
             preoperative chemotherapy, which means surgical removal of all clinically evident
             disease in the breast and lymph nodes.

               1. Breast surgery: patients must have undergone either breast-conserving surgery or
                  mastectomy/nipple- or skin-sparing mastectomy. The margins of the resected
                  specimen should be free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (no ink on
                  tumor). In the case of breast-conserving surgery patients with margins positive
                  for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.
                  For patients who undergo mastectomy, patients with a microscopic positive deep
                  margin are eligible, provided they have received radiotherapy on chest wall.

               2. Lymph node surgery:

             i. Axillary dissection without sentinel node evaluation is permitted after
             preoperative therapy.

             ii. In case of positive results from a fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or
             sentinel node biopsy performed prior to preoperative therapy, additional surgical
             evaluation of the axilla following preoperative therapy is required.

             iii. If sentinel node biopsy performed before preoperative therapy was negative, no
             additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is required after preoperative therapy.

             iv. Sentinel node after preoperative therapy is allowed if no evidence of axillary
             node involvement was documented by ultrasonography at diagnosis. If sentinel node
             biopsy after preoperative therapy is negative, no further additional surgical
             evaluation of the axilla is required. If sentinel node biopsy performed after
             preoperative therapy is positive, additional surgical evaluation of the axilla is
             recommended.

          4. Pathologic evidence of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast and/or axillary lymph
             nodes on the surgical specimen obtained after preoperative therapy (ypT1micN0,
             ypT1micN0i+, ypT0N0i+ will be excluded).

          5. Clinical stage at presentation: T1-4, N0-3, M0 (Exception: Patients with T1a/bN0
             tumors at presentation will not be eligible).

          6. No more than 8 weeks may elapse between the date of last treatment (surgery or
             post-surgery radiotherapy if indicated) and the date of randomization. In case of
             positive margins after the first intervention requiring additional resection, in a
             patient for whom post-surgery radiotherapy is not indicated, the interval of 8 weeks
             will be calculated from the date of last surgery.

          7. Availability of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block containing tumor tissue or
             at least 7 unstained tumor slides (tumor sample from the diagnostic core-biopsy
             obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy). In case only 7 unstained slides from the
             bioptic sample will be available, the investigator must ensure that the sample
             contains tumor tissue by performing an hematoxylin and eosin staining.

        Exclusion criteria: Stratum A (Adjuvant patients) &amp; B (Post-neoadjuvant patients)

          1. Stage IV breast cancer.
