  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant patients are at increased risk of colonization and infection with Multidrug
      Resistant Organisms (MDROs) due to medications that modify their immune systems, increased
      healthcare and antibiotic exposure, and surgical manipulation of mucosa. In this study,
      kidney transplant patients who have infections with resistant bacteria will be given a Fecal
      Microbiota Transplant (FMT), also known as a fecal transplant, after they receive antibiotic
      treatment. This study will see if FMT will eliminate the resistant bacteria so that the
      kidney transplant patients do not have to use last resort antibiotics.

      This Phase 1 pilot study is to obtain preliminary safety data for FMT in renal transplant
      patients to support the rationale for a subsequent clinical trial, not to establish efficacy
      or toxicity. This trial is designed to test the safety of FMT, identify clinical outcomes,
      assess feasibility, and refine the target population in participants with MDRO colonization
      and intestinal dysbiosis. Data from this study should provide directions for the design of
      future clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants who meet key eligibility criteria [adults who have undergone renal
      transplantation and have a history of infection with the Target Multidrug Resistant Organisms
      (MDRO)] will be approached for consideration of study participation. For this study, Target
      MDRO colonization is defined as a positive bacterial culture of either carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Extended Spectrum
      Beta-Lactamases (ESBL), and/or multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas from perirectal swab
      sampling.

      The 20 trial participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms: the control
      arm [not receiving Allogeneic Human Stool in Glycerol (10%; AHSG) via Fecal Microbiota
      Transplant (FMT)] and the experimental arm (receiving AHSG via FMT). Participants in the
      control arm participants can crossover to receive the treatment after completing a study
      cycle without FMT. Each cycle lasts 6 weeks and participants will complete a maximum of 2
      treatment cycles; participants randomized to the experimental arm will complete a maximum of
      two cycles and those randomized to the control arm will complete up to three cycles. Upon
      completion of the final cycle, all trial participants will be followed for just over 6
      months.

      In addition to the trial participants, there will also be one stool donor participant. The
      consented, screened, and eligible stool donor will be identified from an established group of
      stool donors and will undergo screening procedures that are specific to this study. This
      individual will donate human stool for the preparation of the AHSG (known as the IND product
      for this study). Upon processing of AHSG, the stool donor will enter the Follow-Up Period and
      remain available for communication to the study team (if necessary) until the Study
      Completion Date. However, no scheduled study assessments are required of the stool donor.
