      This is a randomized controlled pilot study aimed at testing different outreach strategies
      (opt-in versus opt-out) to increase colorectal cancer screening through completion of mailed
      home fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT).

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study aimed at testing different outreach strategies to
      increase colorectal cancer screening using mailed fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT).
      The investigators will randomize a cohort of subjects between the ages of 50-74 into 2 arms:

        1. Opt-In - subject must actively choose to receive a home FIT kit.

        2. Opt-Out - a FIT kit is sent as a default unless the subject actives chooses not to
           receive the kit or reports prior screening.
