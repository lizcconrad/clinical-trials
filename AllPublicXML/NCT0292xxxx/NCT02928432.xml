  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate (AA) has shown a favourable impact in overall survival, administered with
      prednisone to decrease the adverse event related to CYP171A suppression.

      Our hypothesis is that the change of prednisone to dexamethasone in CRPC patients that
      progress biochemically to AA + prednisone can improve the number and the length of the
      responses, and also improve tolerance to treatment, decreasing the adverse events associated
      to a moderate dosage of steroids used chronically.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II multicentric-study analyse the role of the steroid switch in patients receiving
      AA. Previous retrospective data (Lorente et al, BJC 2014) has shown that the change of
      prednisone by dexamethasone in CRPC patients treated with AA post-docetaxel leaded to durable
      biochemical responses in 40% of cases. Recently, superiority of dexamethasone over prednisone
      in PSA response has been reported by a phase II trial that included 82 chemotherapy-naive
      metastatic CRPC patients.

      In our study patients with biochemical and/or limited radiological progression to AA +
      prednisone are prospectively enrolled. The principal objective was to evaluate the percentage
      of PSA responses in clinically stable metastatic CRPC patients after at least 12 weeks of AA
      + prednisone. Secondary aims will include time to biochemical progression, time to first
      radiological progression, overall survival and the evaluation of the safety profile.

      Biochemical response was monitored with PSA determinations every 4 weeks, and defined as a ≥
      30% decline in PSA from baseline, confirmed with a second reading. PSA progression was
      evaluated according to PCWG2 criteria. Radiological response was re-evaluated every 12-16
      weeks using bone and CT-scan according to RECIST v1.1 and PCWG2 criteria.

      Translational studies: archival tissue will be obtained from all patients, to perform PTEN
      and TMPRSS-ERG rearrangements evaluation. Plasma will be collected after AA + prednisone
      progression to study the androgen receptor status in plasma.
