  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to document the acceptability of the Tonic and Phasic
      Alertness Training (TAPAT) training program in older adults with chronic late-life insomnia.
      The goal of this study is to employ a computerized attention-training program, TAPAT,
      designed for chronic late-life insomnia in a randomized, controlled trial to assess
      feasibility and initial efficacy in this population.
