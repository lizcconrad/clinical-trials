    <textblock>
      Comparison of two techniques of central venous cannulation of subclavian vein using
      ultrasound was performed. ultrasound guided central venous cannulation is the standard
      practice today but its use in subclavian vein is technically challenging and not much
      literature is available. In this study 96 Patients were randomized into one of the groups and
      compared for various outcomes. The primary outcome studied was the time taken for procedure.
      Secondary objectives included comparison of total access time using both the
      techniques,comparison of first attempt success rate, comparison of the quality of needle
      visualization and the comparison of immediate (mechanical) and delayed complication rates.

    <description>ultrasound is a medical device which is frequently used for safe venous punctures as you can visualise the structures.so, device ''ultrasound'' will be used for intervention ''central line insertion'' in subclavian vein. ultrasound guided cannulation of the subclavian vein was done by supraclavicular or infraclavicular approach after randomization into either of the two groups.In the supraclavicular approach the puncture site is above the clavicle while in the infraclavicular group the puncture site is below the clavicle. Central venous cannulation is done after identifying the vein on ultrasound and using standard seldinger technique with full asepsis.</description>
