  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised, subject-masked, crossover, bilateral study, controlled by cross
      comparison. Fifty subjects will use each lens type for a week in random sequence. Follow-up
      visits for each lens will be performed after one week of wear. Lenses will be worn on a daily
      wear, daily disposable wear schedule.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will only be eligible for the study if:

               1. They are of legal age (18) and capacity to volunteer.

               2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to
                  sign a Statement of Informed Consent.

               3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

               4. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
                  study.

               5. They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -1.00 to - 6.00D
                  (Diopters) (inclusive)

               6. They have a spectacle cylindrical correction of -0.75D or less in each eye.

               7. At dispensing, they can attain at least 0.10 logMAR distance high contrast visual
                  acuity in each eye with the study lenses within the available power range.

               8. They currently use soft contact lenses or have done so in the previous six
                  months.

               9. They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least five days per week
                  and for at least eight hours per day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will not be eligible to take part in the study if:

               1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens
                  wear.

               2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens
                  wear.

               3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

               4. They have had cataract surgery.

               5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

               6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear
                  or have keratoconus.

               7. They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

               8. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

               9. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have
                  any immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe
                  allergic reaction.

              10. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
                  research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
