        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subject, aged 19- 45 years at screening.

          2. Body weight of ≥ 55 kg and within ± 20% of ideal body weight (IBW)(kg) = {height (cm)
             - 100} * 0.9

          3. No morbid symptom or sign, based on physical examination, with no innate or chronic
             disease.

          4. Subject that is considered appropriate for participating in the study by an
             investigator, based on clinical laboratory test (hematology, clinical chemistry,
             urinalysis) that is performed according to the characteristics of investigational
             drugs.

          5. Subjects must be able to listen to and understand the detailed statement of informed
             consent, and willing to decide to participate in the study, follow the study
             directions and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinically significant disease or history in hepatobiliary system, kidney, digestive
             system, respiratory system, hemato-oncological system, endocrine system,
             neuro-psychiatric system, musculo-skeletal system, immune system,
             otorhinolaryngological system or cardiovascular system.

          2. A history of gastrointestinal system disorder(i.e, Crohn's disease, ulcer, acute or
             chronic pancreatitis) or surgery (excluding simple appendectomy or herniorrhaphy) that
             may affect absorption of investigational drugs.

          3. A history of hypersensitivity to investigational drugs and its additives or clinically
             significant hypersensitivity to any other drug.

          4. Galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption and
             any other hereditary disorder.

          5. Vital sign measured in sitting position meets any one of following results; systolic
             blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or &lt;100 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg or &lt;60
             mmHg, pulse ≥ 100 times/min.

          6. Aspartate aminotransferase(AST) or Alanine aminotransaminase(ALT) &gt; 2 times upper
             normal limit, or Total bilirubin &gt; 2 times upper normal limit.

          7. Renal disorder (Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault
             formula)

          8. Positive in serologic tests (RPR Ab(VDRL), HBsAg, hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, anti
             HIV(AIDS))

          9. History of drug abuse, or positive in drug screening test.

         10. Use of inducer or inhibitor of metabolic enzymes for drugs like barbiturate.

         11. Use of any prescribed drugs or herbal remedies within 2 weeks, or use of any
             over-the-counter medication within 1 week prior to the first administration of
             investigational drug, and this will affect this study or the safety of the subjects at
             discretion of study investigator.

         12. Participation in another clinical trial or a bioequivalent study within 3 months prior
             to the first administration of investigational drug (The finish time of previous study
             is the day of the last administration of study drug)

         13. Whole blood donation within 2 months or component donation within 1 month, prior to
             the first administration of investigational drug, or transfusion within 1 month prior
             to the first administration of investigational drug.

         14. Prolonged excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;21 units/week, 1 unit=10g of pure alcohol),
             or subjects who can not abstain from drinking from 24 hours prior to hospitalization
             until the discharge.

         15. Smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, excessive caffeine consumption (example:
             instant coffee &gt; 5 cups/day)

         16. Subjects planning to get a dental treatment(tooth extraction, orthodontic treatment,
             endodontic treatment etc) and a selective surgery(aesthetic surgery, LASIK, LASEK etc)
             during the period from informed consent form(ICF) to post-study visit, which is
             impossible to be postponed.

         17. Subjects who are judged to be inappropriate for this study by investigators according
             to other reasons including clinical lab test result
