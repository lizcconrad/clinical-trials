      To test the hypothesis that increasing the sinus node rate with atropine treatment prior to
      exercise will reduce exercise-triggered ventricular ectopy compared to baseline in patients
      with CPVT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross-over trial that will enroll eligible patients with CPVT and
      perform a baseline treadmill exercise tolerance test (ETT) followed by a repeat treadmill ETT
      with I.V. atropine administered immediately prior to exercise. Atropine is a parasympathetic
      blocker and results in sinus tachycardia, which is expected to reduce the diastolic interval
      thereby reducing delayed after depolarizations and ventricular ectopy compared to baseline.
      Both ETTs will be performed on the same day with two hours of rest scheduled between ETTs.
      The primary analysis will be a paired comparison of the number of ventricular ectopic beats
      recorded during exercise (and recovery) at baseline and following pre-treatment with
      atropine. Secondary endpoints will include the presence of ventricular ectopy (yes/no),
      complex ventricular ectopy (couplets or greater, yes/no), and the number of runs of complex
      ventricular ectopy.
