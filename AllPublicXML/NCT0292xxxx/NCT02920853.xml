  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a novel, enhanced form of biofeedback can help
      individuals regulate their chronic musculoskeletal pain more effectively.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relaxation is a low-cost treatment for managing pain with little or no side effects. The
      proposed study will use a novel biofeedback treatment to try and enhance the capacity of
      relaxation to engage pain inhibitory circuits. Specifically, a biofeedback system
      (Biofeedback Training for Conditioned Pain Regulation, BT-CPR) will be used to monitor the
      participant's level of sympathetic arousal and will use this to control the intensity of
      painful stimulations delivered to the participant during biofeedback training. Thus, when the
      participant successfully relaxes (and reduces their arousal), the intensity is lowered and
      produces pain relief. Efficacy of the treatment will be tested in a small, randomized
      controlled trial in which individuals with a verified diagnosis of chronic musculoskeletal
      pain will receive 10 treatment sessions, or 10 sessions of a control condition (traditional
      biofeedback, to control for the effects of relaxation on pain). The aim will be to assess
      whether the treatment results in improvements in clinical pain outcomes (e.g., pain
      intensity, quality of life, pain interference) and psychosocial variables (e.g., coping,
      self-efficacy, mood).

    <description>Participants will receive training in relaxation and biofeedback to develop skills in relaxation/arousal reduction, and pain reduction. Then they will practice relaxing and reducing their arousal as they view graphical arousal feedback. Electric stimulations will be delivered throughout the biofeedback training to provide pain relief when relaxation is achieved.</description>
