  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze quality and adverse events of analgesia
      by telemedically supported paramedics in comparison to conventional treatment by on-scene
      emergency medical service (EMS) physicians in the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard emergency medical service (EMS) in Germany consists of a two-tiered system with
      ambulances (paramedics) and prehospital EMS physician units. For example, legal conditions
      restrict opioid-based analgesia to physicians. Based on pre-defined standards regional
      emergency dispatch centers deploy both kinds of emergency units.

      In recent years telemedicine emerged as a complementary system in EMS that may provide remote
      medical expertise and sustain or even improve quality of medical treatment on-scene.
      Particularly, based on the results of the projects Med-on-@ix and TemRas (telemedical rescue
      assistance system), emergency telemedical services were gradually implemented in daily
      routine of the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.

      In this retrospective study the quality and adverse events of analgesia by telemedically
      supported paramedics shall be compared to conventional treatment by on-scene EMS physicians
      in the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.

    <description>Ambulances in the EMS of the city of Aachen are equipped with a portable telemedicine system. In emergencies requiring intravenous analgesia paramedics can use this system to contact the tele-EMS physician with an audio-connection. Vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) can be transferred in real-time. The transmission of still pictures - taken with an official smartphone - and video streaming from the inside of the ambulance are also possible. The tele-EMS physician supports the paramedics and can delegate the application of morphine and other analgesics based on two predefined algorithms for trauma and non-trauma cases that are displayed on a context-sensitive telemedical documentation system in the teleconsultation center.</description>

    <description>This (control) group represents the conventional treatment in German emergency medical service (EMS). In addition to an ambulance manned with paramedics, a prehospital EMS physician is deployed to conduct analgesic treatment on-scene. Treatment data for this group are selected from the time period before implementing teleconsultation in routine and therefore represent a historical control group.</description>
