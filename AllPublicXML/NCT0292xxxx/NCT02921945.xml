    <textblock>
      In this trial safety and efficacy of SCT800 (B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII) is
      being evaluated in 50 subjects, 12 to 65 years of age, with moderate to severe Hemophilia A.
      These subjects will receive open label treatment with SCT800 for approximately 6 months for
      on-demand treatment.
