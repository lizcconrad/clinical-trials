  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a risk factor for carotid atherosclerotic whose progression is associated with an
      increased risk of vascular events. Investigators assessed prospectively by arterial duplex
      ultrasonography the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in a cohort of people with
      diabetes to assess the importance of progression and to analyze the impact of this
      progression on vascular events. The main hypothesis is that people with carotid
      atherosclerosis progression are at higher risk of vascular events than those without any
      progression.

    <description>At each visit, carotid arteries were examined by duplex ultrasonography. The most severe lesion for each patient was selected. Results were classified in three Strandness categories: normal (no atherosclerotic lesions), stenosis &lt; 50% (systolic ratio Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)/Common Carotid Artery (CCA) &lt; 2) and stenosis ≥ 50% (systolic ratio ICA/CCA ≥ 2). A progression was the move to a higher category.</description>
