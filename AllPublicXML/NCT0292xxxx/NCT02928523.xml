  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (AFMT) to acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with intensive chemotherapy and antibiotics in order
      to restore the balance of their intestinal microbiome and thereby eradicate treatment-induced
      multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB), infection-related complications, as well as sequelae to
      the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the investigators propose to perform a single-arm
      multicentre prospective fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) trial in AML patients
      receiving intensive chemotherapy, and who are usually heavily treated with broad-spectrum
      antibiotics during aplasia that generate a profound status of dysbiosis. For this purpose, at
      the time of admission and AML diagnosis, patients will be requested to donate stools that
      will be comprehensively screened, and if deemed appropriate according to protocol criteria,
      conditioned and stored frozen until future processing and transplantation after aplasia
      completion.
