    <textblock>
      Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has achieved
      impressive clinical results with durable complete responses in patients with metastatic
      melanoma. The TILs are isolated from patients own tumor tissue followed by in vitro expansion
      and activation for around 4-6 weeks. Before TIL infusion the patients receive 1 week of
      preconditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. After TIL infusion
      Interleukin-2 is administered to support T cell activation and proliferation in vivo.

      Recent studies suggest, that TIL therapy works in other cancers than Metastatic Melanoma,
      including Renal Cell Carcinoma. In this study TIL therapy is administered to patients with
      metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

      melanoma. The TILs are isolated from patients own tumor tissue followed by in vitro expansion

      Interleukin-2 is administered to support T cell activation and proliferation in vivo.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate safety and feasibility when treating patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma with ACT with TILs.

      To evaluate treatment related immune responses . To evaluate clinical efficacy.

      Design:

      Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood samples, pulmonary
      function test, Cr-EDTA clearance, MUGA scan and ECG.

      Patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production.

      Patients is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.

      On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 administration with
      high-dose bolus IL-2 every eight hour for up to 5 days (maximum of 15 doses).

      The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.

    <description>All patients receive the same treatment.
Surgical removal of tumor tissue for T cell production, which takes 4-6 weeks, is performed initially.
All patients are hospitalized during treatment (one week in advance of the T cell product being ready and for approximately 3 weeks in total) and receive treatment only once.
The patients are admitted to hospital day -8 and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on day -7 to day -1.
The TILs are infused on day 0 and Interleukin-2 therapy is administered on day 0 to day 5. Interleukin-2 is administered as high-dose i.v. bolus every eight hour starting approximately 6 hours after TIL infusion and for up to 5 days (maximum of 15 doses).</description>
