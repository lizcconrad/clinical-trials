  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether early administration of aspirin in acute
      ischemic stroke patients treated with systemic thrombolysis is safe and can improve outcomes
      due to decreasing the number of early rethromboses.

      According to the current guidelines (European Stroke Organisation, 2009; American Heart
      Association-American Stroke Association, 2013) on the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic
      stroke patients it is recommended (class C) to start antithrombotic therapy (including
      antiplatelets and anticoagulants) when 24 hours go after alteplase (rtPA, recombinant tissue
      plasminogen activator) administration. Meanwhile rtPA has wery short lifetime in blood (T1/2
      4-6 minutes). Some retrospective studies have found that early administration of
      antithrombotics (8-16 hours) after systemic thrombolysis can improve functional outcome and
      does not increase the risk of haemorrhage.

      The investigators suggest a controlled prospective trial to recognise risks and benefits of
      early administration of aspirin (in 12 hours) after rtPA therapy in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke.
