  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and
      toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs* prescribed for treatment of
      patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic
      or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved
      targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical
      companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses.
      Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable
      performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been
      performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable
      molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will
      be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The
      choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a
      knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The
      protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific
      eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future
      genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol
      will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free
      and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related
      toxicity will be evaluated.

      Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor
      characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and
      physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options
      have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their
      patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while
      legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label
      treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the
      research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to
      repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment
      strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan
      diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is
      a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on
      broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of
      available resources.

      Envisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are
      treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in
      which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor
      type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is
      an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and
      broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such
      therapy.

      Plan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based
      on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have
      exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable
      molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help
      physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable
      insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be
      performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the
      Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP
      and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.

      Expected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label,
      providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to
      targeted therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult (age &gt;18 years) patient with a histologically-proven locally advanced or
             metastatic solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who is no
             longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment or for whom no such treatment
             is available or indicated.

             * For GBM patients: Histologically confirmed recurrent or de novo glioblastoma
             (primary), with unequivocal first progression after radiotherapy and

          2. ECOG performance status 0-2

          3. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, specific
             inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the drug-specific study manual will take
             precedence:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l

               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l

               5. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN in patients
                  with known hepatic metastases)

               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50
                  mL/min/1.73 m2

          4. Patients must have objectively evaluable or measurable disease (by physical or
             radiographic examination, according to RECIST v1.1 for patients with solid tumors, or
             according to IMWG, Lugano, RANO or GCIG criteria, resp., for patients with multiple
             myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, glioblastoma or ovarian cancer in case of CA125-based
             evaluation (please refer to appendices for further details) [16, 17].

          5. Results must be available from a tumor genomic or protein expression test. Eligible
             tests may include any of the following technologies: fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), comparative genomic
             hybridization (CGH), next generation sequencing (NGS) or immunohistochemistry (IHC).
             The test may have been performed on the primary tumor or a metastatic deposit, in a
             diagnostic laboratory or within the context of another CPCT study, and must reveal a
             potentially actionable variant as defined in Section 5. The test results (full
             pathology or molecular diagnostics report) must be uploaded in the eCRF.

          6. Patients must have a tumor profile for which single agent treatment with one of the
             EMA approved targeted anti-cancer drugs included in this study has potential clinical
             benefit based on preclinical data or clinical information (see section 5).

          7. A new (obtained ≤2 months before inclusion, and without any type of anti-cancer
             therapy within those ≤2 months ) fresh frozen tumor biopsy specimen for extensive
             biomarker testing is mandatory before the start of treatment with a targeted agent
             included in the protocol.

             *For GBM patients:

             The mandatory fresh frozen tumor biopsy sample can be obtained through
             standard-of-care surgical procedures (i.e., performed at progression, for
             cytoreduction, to proof progressive disease, or to reduce mass effect on the
             surrounding brain tissue). Thus, surgical procedures are standard-of-care and not part
             of trial participation. Fresh frozen tumor tissue must have been obtained ≤2 months
             before inclusion, and without any type of anti-cancer therapy within those ≤2 months.
             After surgical procedures, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria:

             i. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence. ii. A post-surgery MRI should be
             available within 48 hours following surgery, and must show residual and measurable
             disease.

             iii. Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed free of drainage
             or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at the time of study
             inclusion.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          9. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.

         10. Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing foetus, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation,
             and for four months following completion of study therapy. Male patients should avoid
             impregnating a female partner. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e.
             post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the
             last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing toxicity &gt; grade 2, other than alopecia.

          2. Patient is receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or
             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol
             acetate, bisphosphonates). These medications must have been started ≥ 1 week prior to
             enrollment on this study.

          3. Patient is pregnant or nursing.

          4. Patients with known active progressive brain metastases. Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a
             seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3
             months prior to registration. All patients with previously treated brain metastases
             must be stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid
             treatment prior to study enrollment.

             * Additional exclusion criteria specific for glioblastoma patients:

               1. Patients who require anti-convulsant therapy must be taking non-enzyme inducing
                  antiepileptic drugs (non-EIAED). EIAED are prohibited. Patients previously on
                  EIAED must be switched to non-EIAED at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.

               2. No radiotherapy within the three months prior to the diagnosis of progression.

               3. No radiotherapy with a dose over 65 Gy, stereotactic radiosurgery or
                  brachytherapy unless the recurrence is histologically proven.

          5. Patients with clinically significant preexisting cardiac conditions, including
             uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or
             symptomatic congestive heart failure are not eligible.

          6. Patients with known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% are not eligible

          7. Patients with stroke (including TIA) or acute myocardial infarction within 3 months
             before the first dose of study treatment are not eligible

          8. Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, or
             severe psychiatric illness/social situations.

        For each drug included in this protocol, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (based
        on the Package Insert or manufacturers recommendations) may also apply. These can be found
        in the supplemental information about each agent included in the drug-specific study
        manuals. Drug-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will take precedence over the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above.
