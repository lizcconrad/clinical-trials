      This study aims to investigate the role of clinical pharmacist in the development of a
      pharmaceutical care program for patients with Acute coronary syndrome tailored to their
      specific learning needs and their cultural context, and to verify the program's effects on
      physiological factors and recurrent symptoms or cardiac events.
