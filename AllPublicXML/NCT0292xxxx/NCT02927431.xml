  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danirixin (DNX) is a novel, selective, and reversible antagonist of the C-X-C chemokine
      receptor (CXCR) 2 and has been shown to decrease neutrophil transmigration and activation to
      areas of inflammation. An intravenous (IV) formulation of DNX hydrobromide (HBr) is being
      developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of adults hospitalized with influenza
      (IFV). While early therapy with antivirals decreases severity and duration of symptoms of
      influenza, there are no drugs that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in randomized clinical
      trials in this population. Current treatment guidelines for hospitalized IFV recommend
      neuraminidase inhibitors as standard of care therapy. IFV studies in animals have
      demonstrated that therapeutic treatment with the combination of a CXCR2 antagonist and a
      neuraminidase inhibitor reduced lung neutrophils and showed trends for improvements in
      clinical scores, lung function and pathology with no evidence of worsening outcomes,
      including viral load. This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind (for IV DNX), placebo-controlled
      (for IV DNX) 3-arm study will be the first study to determine the efficacy and safety of IV
      DNX when co-administered (in all groups) with standard of care antiviral treatment
      (open-label oral oseltamivir [OSV]) in subjects hospitalized with IFV. The primary objective
      of the study is to assess the efficacy of treatment with IV DNX twice daily given with oral
      OSV compared to oral OSV twice daily on time to clinical response (TTCR). In this study,
      subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 15 milligram (mg) free base equivalent (FBE)
      IV DNX, 50 mg FBE IV DNX, or matching placebo twice daily. All subjects will also receive
      open-label 75 mg oral OSV, twice daily (given as standard of care). The study treatment
      duration will be for up to 5 days. The investigator may elect to continue treatment with OSV
      after 5 days of study treatment. Follow up will continue until Day 45 for all subjects. The
      study will begin with enhanced safety monitoring in sentinel cohorts, leading to stepwise
      enrollment of subjects. Subjects will be enrolled based on increasing levels of renal
      impairment, and less severe hospitalized subjects will be enrolled prior to enrollment of
      critically ill subjects, as this is the first study conducted in the hospitalized population
      with severe IFV. Approximately 300 subjects are targeted to be enrolled in the study.
