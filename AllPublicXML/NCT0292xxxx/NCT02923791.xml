    <textblock>
      This study compares the potential immunogenicity of two filgrastims, the proposed biosimilar
      Filgrastim Hospira (US) and the US-approved Neupogen reference product. Subjects will receive
      doses of one of the two filgrastims by injection of 5 micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg). Subjects
      will receive 5 consecutive daily doses in Period 1 (Days 1-5) and a single dose on Day 1 of
      Period 2. Pre-dose and serial post-dose assessments of immunogenicity will be conducted each
      of the two study periods. In addition, safety assessments will be conducted throughout the
      study.

             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; status will be confirmed by having a serum

             year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

          4. Any active systemic or immunologic disease or condition, including but not limited to
             the following general categories: cardiovascular/pulmonary, hepatorenal, or systemic
             infection, or lactation.

             years.

          6. Any disease or condition that might interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of the study drug or would place the subject at increased
             risk.

          7. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities including leukocytosis (defined as total
             leukocytes &gt;11,000/mcL), leukopenia (defined as total leukocytes &lt;4000/mcL), or
             neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1500/mcL), or
             thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count of &lt;150/mcL).

          8. Lacks adequate hepatic reserve as defined by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the
             reference lab; lack of renal reserve as defined by serum creatinine of ≥1.2 x ULN for
             reference lab or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤ 80 mg/min; or has
