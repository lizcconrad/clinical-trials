      This study assesses the feasibility of a full course of Low Pulse Amplitude-Seizure Therapy
      (LAP-ST) (primary outcome).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is hypothesized to increase stimulation focality, thus minimizing cognitive side effects
      compared to conventional ECT. The study will enroll 22 patients recruited from the Behman
      Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Patients referred to ECT service in the Behman Hospital who are
      clinically indicated to do ECT for major depressive episode of a mood disorder or psychotic
      episode of a primary psychotic disorder will be approached. Eligible participants who signed
      informed consent will be included to receive a course of Right Unilateral Ultrabrief LAP-ST.
