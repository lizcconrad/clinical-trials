  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess oral health, oral hygiene knowledge, and daily oral
      hygiene practices of women who participated in a randomized controlled trial (2011001) at
      University of Alabama Birmingham during the period 2012-2014. Additional objectives of the
      research include evaluation of possible cultural, biological or other mechanisms for outcomes
      observed in the OHMOM clinical trial, and oral health screening of children born to mothers
      during the study for the purposes of understanding possible multigenerational effects of oral
      hygiene education.
