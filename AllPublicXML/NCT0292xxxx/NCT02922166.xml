  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of SRX246 on fear and anxiety based on fear-potentiated startle in
      humans. Additionally, the effects of the compound on emotion recognition will be explored.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a double-blind, cross-over design in which each subject will receive
      placebo and SRX246 for 5-7 days before testing (given in counter-balanced order). The study
      will examine the effect of the drug on the potentiation of startle using a well-established
      paradigm that involves anticipation of no-shock, predictable shock, and unpredictable shock.
      Drug effects on emotion recognition will also be explored.

             or major depression as determined by the family history method; specifically,
             participant will know diagnosis or treatment in order to confirm presence of disorder.

          -  Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial in which (s)he is or will

             gelatin.

             startles used during the habituation visit.

          -  Subjects who would be noncompliant with the visit schedule or study procedures.
             Possible noncompliance may include planned vacations or planned hospitalizations
