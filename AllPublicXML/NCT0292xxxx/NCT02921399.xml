  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After endoscopic resection (ER) of gastric tumors, eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H.
      pylori) infection is advised to reduce metachronous recurrence. However, few studies have
      addressed factors influencing H. pylori eradication rates in the aftermath of ER, and none
      have focused on the optimal timing of therapy to eradicate H. pylori post-ER.Therefore, the
      investigators will conduct to evaluate whether differences in timing of eradication therapy
      after ER of gastric tumors.

        Patients who received proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy for H. pylori
        eradication after endoscopic resection for gastric neoplasms. Clinicopathologic
        characteristics, particularly the timing of triple therapy, were used to compare
        eradication rates, assigning patients to early- (≤2 weeks),and late-phase (≥8 weeks)
        eradication groups.
