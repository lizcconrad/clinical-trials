  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open label, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of two infusions of CYP-001, in adults who have steroid-resistant GvHD.

      Participants will receive standard of care treatment throughout the study, according to local
      procedures. The first eight participants will be enrolled in Cohort A and receive a CYP-001
      dose of 1 million cells per kg, up to a maximum dose of 100 million cells, on Day 0 and Day
      7. Subject to a safety review of data from Cohort A, an additional eight participants will be
      enrolled into Cohort B and receive a CYP-001 dose of 2 million cells/kg, up to a maximum dose
      of 200 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. The primary evaluation period concludes for each
      participant 100 days after the first dose of CYP-001. Participants will have study visits on
      Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 100. Subsequently, participants will enter a long term
      follow-up period, which concludes 2 years after the first dose of CYP-001.

    <description>The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus™ platform technology. Cymerus™ refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus™ process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique.</description>

          -  Agree to have follow-up data collected for two years after their initial dose of

             (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of IMP.

          -  Known or suspected current alcohol or substance abuse problem.

          -  Progressive or relapsing haematological malignancy, a current solid tumour, or
             previous malignant solid tumour that is likely to recur during the period of the study
             (with the exception of a past history of basal or squamous cell carcinomas).

          -  Heart failure (NYHA Functional Class II-IV) and/or pulmonary failure.

          -  Haemodynamically unstable and/or at high risk of cardiovascular events.

          -  Terminal organ failure.

          -  Meningitis, pneumonia with hypoxemia, HIV or another severe or uncontrolled systemic
             infection, which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to impact on the ability
             of the patient to participate in the trial.
