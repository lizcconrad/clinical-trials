    <textblock>
      This study investigates airway effects of PEEP during maskventilation at anesthesia
      induction. Four patient groups will be ventilated with different PEEP and driving pressures
      to evaluate time to open airway after start of positive pressure maskventilation during
      anesthesia induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of continuous positive pressure (CPAP/PEEP) during pre-oxygenation and
      mask-ventilation in patients undergoing anesthesia induction is increasing. Continuous
      positive pressures have several respiratory benefits with well-documented data on both
      spontaneously breathing patients and intubated patients. However the effects of PEEP on
      anesthetized patients during mask-ventilation is poorly investigated. In a previous trial the
      that the investigators conducted, a PEEP-level of 10 cmH2O during mask ventilation after
      anesthesia induction surprisingly delayed time to alveolar ventilation compared to ZEEP. In
      order to investigate this phenomenon, four groups of patients will be compared during
      preoxygenation and mask ventilation after anesthesia induction.

      Each group consisting of 30 patients will be pre-oxygenated and mask ventilated with
      different CPAP/PEEP levels and different driving pressures. Time to open airway is measured
      as number of respiratory cycles until detection of CO2 on the capnograph.
