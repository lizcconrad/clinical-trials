      This study is part of the Health Canada approval requirement for tolvaptan and is an
      observational, non-interventional study (NIS) describing the impact of tolvaptan on
      ADPKD-related burden of illness as measured with a set of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)
      Questionnaires. The study is also describing the time to renal replacement therapy (RRT),
      such as dialysis and transplantation, and the long-term mortality rate and causes (i.e. renal
      and hepatic), in ADPKD patients treated with tolvatan (JINARC™)
