  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective, diagnostic trial in radically treated patients with biochemical
      recurrence of prostate cancer. Patients with radically treated prostate cancer with
      biochemical relapse and negativity of all traditional morphological and functional imaging
      (transrectal ultrasound, bone scan, 18F-FMC PET/CT, CT/MRI) or doubtful imaging of
      2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] (18F)-fluoromethylcholine (FMC) PET/CT will receive a Gallio-68
      (68Ga)- Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed
      Tomography (CT) scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective, diagnostic trial. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET /CT defined as the ratio between the number of
      68Ga-PSMA PET /CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer patients with
      biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Sensitivity for different Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) values (ranges)

        -  Sensitivity for different lesion sites

        -  Treatment response assessment with a second PET

        -  False positives detection during Follow Up (FUP) (with other standard methods and
           eventually optional biopsy) for patient without any treatment

        -  safety 67 evaluable patients will be injected with 100-200 megabecquerel (MBq) 68Ga-PSMA
           intravenously
