    <textblock>
      Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), also known as restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common
      neurological sensorimotor disorder that typically impairs sleep and quality of life, likely
      consequent to a central dopaminergic dysfunction associated to brain iron deficiency.
      Periodic limb movements (PLMS) in sleep are present in 80% of patients with WED. PLMS are
      often associated with micro-arousals that contribute to sleep fragmentation and repeated
      increases of blood pressure and heart rate throughout the night, thus representing an
      increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

      Willis-Ekbom disease affects people with higher cardiovascular risk factors, such as advanced
      age, obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. However, previous observational,
      cross-sectional or longitudinal population-based studies on the association between RLS and
      CVD and hypertension showed controversial results.

      While the pathophysiology of RLS is yet to be elucidated and is likely multifactorial, one
      theory involves a reduction in dopaminergic outflow to the preganglionic sympathetic neurons
      in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Dopamine inhibits preganglionic sympathetic neurons,
      therefore a reduction in dopamine may in turn increase sympathetic outflow.

      Based on this notion, the investigators hypothesize an increase of sympathetic autonomic
      activity in Willis-Ekbom disease responsible for the recurrent increase in blood pressure and
      heart rate during sleep, which may play a role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular
      diseases.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the autonomic nervous activity in patients with WED
      compared to healthy volunteers controls. The investigators will measure primarily the cardiac
      sympathetic activity by the 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy and
      secondarily the sympathetic nerve activity by the microneurography, the plasmatic pro
      inflammatory biomarkers and urinary catecholamine levels and the circadian variation of blood
      pressure and heart rate as assessed by the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
