    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that early supported discharge and continued rehabilitation at home
      (ESD) delivered by an interdisciplinary team reduces deaths or dependency in activities in
      daily living after stroke. Despite recommendations in national guidelines ESD is only
      implemented in few places in Sweden. There are interdisciplinary teams that supply
      rehabilitation in the home but the coordinated transition is lacking. Such rehabilitation is
      not evidence based. The key components of a coordinated transition to achieve the benefits of
      ESD are not known. The aim is to design, implement and evaluate new person-centred
      transitions between stroke units and the home to achieve full ESD. The development of
      person-centred transition will be performed together by people with stroke, significant
      others, stroke unit staff and interdisciplinary teams.

      Phase 1, a prospective observational study of current transitions from stroke units to
      rehabilitation in the home without coordination. The aim is to identify factors that are
      facilitators or barriers to transitions, patient and caregiver outcomes, use of health care
      during the first year after stroke. In phase 2, a co-design process of new person-centred
      transitions will be carried out by people with stroke, significant others, stroke unit staff
      and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams. In phase 3 new person-centred transitions
      will be implemented to form a full ESD service and evaluated in a cluster randomised
      controlled trial.

      Project description A phased approach, as recommended for development and evaluation of
      complex interventions, will be used. In phase 1 the current transitions from stroke units to
      the home environment will be explored and facilitators / barriers to coordinated
      person-centred safe transitions will be identified. Knowledge generated in phase 1 will
      inform phase 2; a co-design process of new coordinated person-centred transitions conducted
      by people with stroke, significant others and staff from stroke units and interdisciplinary
      home rehabilitation teams together. Knowledge from phase 1 and phase 2 will inform phase 3;
      implementation and evaluation of the missing link.

      Phase 1 Aims: Explore current state of transitions combined with rehabilitation in the home,
      identify facilitators and barriers to person-centred transitions, current patient and
      caregiver outcome, satisfaction, and resource use of health services during the first year
      after stroke.

        1. Design: prospective longitudinal observational study. Participants: people with
           mild/moderate stroke, referred from stroke units to home rehabilitation and their
           significant others will be asked to participate before discharge from the stroke unit.
           Power calculations indicate the inclusion of 300 participants with stroke. Data
           collection: Baseline data on medical and socio-demographic aspects and functioning will
           be collected from the medical records. Data on satisfaction with the transition process
           will be collected with the Care Transition Measure (CTM) after discharge from the stroke
           unit. At 3, and 12 months people with stroke will be assessed regarding disability,
           perceived impact of stroke, participation in social activities, health related quality
           of life, perceived needs of health services and satisfaction with services received
           using reliable validated measures and structured interviews. Data on caregiver burden,
           life satisfaction and informal care will be collected from significant others. Data on
           use of health care will be obtained from the register at Stockholms LÃ¤ns Landsting.
           Analyses: Statistical analyses to identify factors at baseline associated with
           satisfactory transitions (CTM), and associations between perceived quality of
           transitions (CTM) and patient and significant other outcomes at 3 and 12 months.

        2. Data: Medical records will be reviewed on the planning and decisions regarding
           transitions e.g., criteria for referral to home rehabilitation, timing and planning,
           information exchange between stroke unit and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation
           teams, and use of decision support. Analyses: Quantitative content analyses.c)
           Participants: staff of stroke units and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams.
           Data collection: Focus group interviews with staff of stroke units on experiences of
           identifying candidates for home rehabilitation, the planning and decisions; and with the
           interdisciplinary teams on experiences of preparation for rehabilitation in the home and
           establishing new contacts with people referred for home rehabilitation. Analyses:
           Thematic analyses with constant comparisons. d) Participants: Strategic samples of
           people with stroke based on satisfaction with transition and their significant others.
           Data collection: Semistructured individual interviews on the experiences of the
           transition from the stroke unit to the home and the initiation of the home
           rehabilitation. Analyses: Thematic analyses with constant comparisons.

      Phase 2 Aims: Create prototype for a new person-centred coordinated safe transition process.

      Design: Workshops with all stakeholders using a collaborative design process which include
      reflection, analysis, and description of the problem, visualization to get a common picture,
      modelling and/or prototyping. Participants: People with stroke, significant others, staff
      from stroke units and interdisciplinary home rehabilitation teams in a series of five
      workshops. Data collection: field-notes, diaries and documentation of the design process. The
      design process comprises six phases: 1. Engage; establish relationship between the
      participants. 2. Plan; generate ideas and goals. 3. Explore; learning about experiences of
      the transition from the stroke unit to the home. 4. Develop; turning ideas into context
      specific improvements. 5. Decide; choose what improvements to make, and how to make them. 6.
      Change; put the decided improvements into action i.e., phase 3. The improvements may involve
      decision support for the staff, the patient and significant others and information and
      support with or without support by information technology.

      Phase 3 Aims: Implement the new transitions between stroke units and the home, a) evaluate
      new person-centred transitions from stroke unit to home rehabilitation compared to
      transitions without coordination in a feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial
      regarding satisfaction with the transitions, patient and caregiver outcomes and use of health
      care during the first year after stroke and explore experiences of the new transitions from
      all stakeholders involved.

      Design: a) Cluster randomized controlled feasibility study. Interdisciplinary home
      rehabilitation teams collaborating with the participating stroke units at Karolinska
      University hospital and Danderyd hospital will be randomised to deliver either the new
      person-centred transitions or initiation of rehabilitation in the home as usual. Based on
      core aspects of person-centred transitions identified in phase I and phase 2 and transition
      designs developed in phase 2 the interface to coordinate the transitions between the
      stroke-unit and each interdisciplinary team will be identified and organised. Participants:
      people with mild to moderate stroke, referred to receive rehabilitation at home in
      participating stroke units, their significant others, staff of the participating stroke units
      and interdisciplinary teams. Data on satisfaction with the transition process will be
      collected with the CTM after discharge from the stroke unit. At 3, and 12 months people with
      stroke will be assessed regarding disability, perceived impact of stroke, participation in
      social activities, health related quality of life, perceived needs of health services and
      satisfaction with services received using reliable validated measures and structured
      interviews. Data on caregiver burden, life satisfaction and informal care will be collected
      from significant others. Data on use of health care will be obtained from the register at
      Stockholms LÃ¤ns Landsting. Analyses comparing outcomes of people who receive the new
      person-centred transitions and transition as usual will be performed intention to treat.
      Analyses will include health economic aspects of the new transitions. b) In addition, open
      ended questions will be asked to the participants with stroke and the significant others
      pertaining to their experiences of the new person-centred transition and the rehabilitation
      in the home environment. Members of the participating interdisciplinary teams and staff of
      the participating stroke units will be interviewed regarding their experiences. The answers
      will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analyses: Thematic applied analyses using
      constant comparisons will be applied to transcripts of the interviews to identify experiences
      of the ESD and specifically the person-centred transition of the staff in the stroke units
      and the participating interdisciplinary teams.
