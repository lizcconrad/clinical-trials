  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of meal size and texture on the levels
      of incretin hormone, GLP-1, after Gastric Bypass Surgery (GBP). Patterns of food intake
      change after bariatric surgery and patients often eat multiple small low-calorie meals, a
      pattern that may affect blood glucose as well as incretin levels. Whether the release of
      GLP-1 after an oral challenge or a single liquid meal has any physiological relevance in
      'real life' setting of multiple small meals diet is unclear.

  <detailed_description>

      The main goal is to study the effect of meal size and texture on incretin levels after GBP.
      Patients will be studied before GBP (T0) and 12-15 months after GBP (T1). At T0 and T1,
      patients will come for 2 study days for 8 hours: On one study day, a single meal will be
      served, on the second study day, three small meals, with the order of the conditions randomly
      assigned. The total amount of calories (600 kcal) and the over all nutrient composition (55%
      CHO, 15 % protein, 30% fat) will be equivalent between conditions. The meals will be either
      all solid or all liquid. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to solid or
      liquid test meals.

      Recruitment and data gathering for this study were performed at St. Luke's Hospital in New
      York, NY. Data Analysis was performed at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY.
