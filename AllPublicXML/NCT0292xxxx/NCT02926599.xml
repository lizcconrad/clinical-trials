  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulated environment allowed safe learning of critical events and knowledge of appropriate
      response and treatment. Anesthesiology resident education curriculum in Lyon plans several
      high fidelity simulation session with a large panel of critical events. Anticipation of
      critical events before they may occur and planification of team resources and priority in the
      treatment strategy may help to improve team performance during the scenario. The
      investigators' goal is to compare individual and team performances with or without an
      optimization personal potential training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the individual and team performances for resident who were
      taught personal optimization skills (positive reinforcement, personalized
      psycho-physiological relaxation, mental rehearsal) and those who didn't.

      The investigators are going to compare groups of anesthesiology residents going through same
      scenarios of simulated critical events in high fidelity simulation session. Scenarios will be
      recorded to be analyzed by 2 reviewers independently. A specific checklist of appropriate
      treatment and a non technical skill checklist will be use to cote team performance (OTTAWA
      and TEAM scales). Stress of the participants will be assessed by visual analogic scale of
      participants anxiety and stress. The two groups will be compare to see if improvement in team
      performance is associated with the intervention.
