  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, DNA sequencing, computational biology modeling, and ex vivo drug sensitivity
      assays will be utilized to define clinically relevant gene mutations and identify potential
      therapeutics for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

  <detailed_description>

      As part of normal clinical care, patients will undergo a peripheral blood draw and bone
      marrow aspiration &amp; biopsy. Blood draws and bone marrow aspirations are performed at the time
      of diagnosis, after treatments , disease progression, and relapse. Under normal clinical
      care, patient specimens are analyzed by cytogenetics (giemsa staining), fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH), and gene mutation profiling. Clinically, treatment can begin before
      these molecular diagnostics are available.

      As part of this repository study, subjects are asked to:

        -  Allow access to banked blood and bone marrow specimens in IRB approved protocol #
           532-2012.

        -  Donate peripheral blood specimens whenever blood is already being drawn for clinical
           purposes such as at times of diagnosis, relapse, refractory disease or disease
           progression. Additional samples may be requested at other standard of care visits in the
           event that initial samples are not viable for DNA sequencing, phenotyping, or functional
           assays for patients with AML, if disease is present.

        -  Donate bone marrow aspirate specimens whenever bone marrow aspiration is already being
           done for clinical purposes such as at times of diagnosis, relapse, refractory disease or
           disease progression. If bone marrow aspirate is being collected for banking protocol
           #532-2012, then an aliquot of the banked specimen will be accessed rather than collect
           an additional bone marrow aspirate for this study.

        -  Undergo skin biopsy and donate the skin biopsy specimen for genomic profiling.

        -  Allow bone marrow, peripheral blood and skin biopsy specimens to be collected for
           genomic profiling and ex vivo drug sensitivity testing.

    <description>AML cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow samples will be examined by next generation sequencing using an Illumina DNA sequencer. DNA from the skin biopsy will be used as the constitutional reference DNA. Using skin DNA greatly improves the ability to accurately and precisely identify somatic mutations in the AML cells.</description>

    <description>Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing will be performed on each subject's AML cells derived from peripheral blood and bone marrow. AML cell viability will be recorded for each treatment condition after 72 hours of treatment. A rank-ordered list of drugs will be created in order of drug toxicity.</description>
