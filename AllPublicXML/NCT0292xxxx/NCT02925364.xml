  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is an amendment to a previously approved blinded randomized controlled
      trial (NCT02697812) which examines the rate at which the sternal retraction maneuver is
      performed during cardiac surgery (standard over 30 seconds versus. gradual over 15 minutes)
      and examines the incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain 6 months following surgery.

      Patients enrolled in the parent study will be identified at the 6 month follow-up and
      recruited in terms of whether they report chest pain. A total of 30 participants will be
      recruited (15 with and 15 with no pain) to undergo a single MRI session in which functional
      MRI will be done on the brain stem and spinal cord and anatomical MRI images will be
      collected for specific chest and neck structures. This will indicate whether there are
      long-term differences in pain processing and/or physical damage to neck and chest structures
      in those with and without chronic pain 6 months following coronary artery bypass graft
      surgery. All functional and anatomical MRI images will be reviewed and interpreted with study
      personnel blinded to whether the patient is reporting pain or no pain at their 6 month
      follow-up interview.

        The study population will be those enrolled in a parent blinded randomized controlled trial
        (NCT02697812). At their 6 month post-cardiac surgery interview, patients reporting no chest
        pain (n=15) or chest pain (n=15) will be recruited to undergo an MRI.
