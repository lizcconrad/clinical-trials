    <textblock>
      This study test whether a Continuous Glucose Monitor can pickup differences in glucose (in
      the interstitial fluid) during a dietary intervention using meals with either a high with a
      low glycemic load.

      The aim of this study is to determine the suitability of a continuous glucose monitor to
      detect the impact of a dietary intervention on postprandial blood glucose levels in normal,
      healthy, free living subjects. We will compare a dietary intervention of meals with a high
      glycemic load (high post-meal blood glucose) versus meals with a low glycemic load (low
      post-meal blood glucose) in a cross-over study. In addition, the glucose profiles obtained
      both via venous blood sampling and via continuous glucose monitor following a standard
      carbohydrate load will be compared.

    <description>Compare the difference in glucose responses to the standard meal on morning after the low and the high glycemic load diet measured in venous blood with the difference as measured in using continuous blood glucose monitor. 2-hour post prandial incremental area under the curve for glucose will be calculated for both methods.</description>

    <description>Difference in post prandial glucose concentrations between the low glycemic load and the high glycemic load diet. Incremental area under the curve after each of the three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) during the three-day dietary interventions will be calculated separately.
