      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the Bioboosti device on sleep for
      patients who have been diagnosed with insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common health complaint that is associated with discomfort, loss of
      productivity, poor health and higher use of healthcare. The use of non-pharmacologic
      treatments for insomnia has gained much attention in recent years. The investigators are
      conducting this research because a safe, non-pharmacologic treatment would benefit patients
      with insomnia, and to see if the Bioboosti device is an effective treatment for insomnia.

      Subjects will include patients from the clinics who have the diagnosis of insomnia. Study
      staff will notify the treating physician of a potential subject. If the subject gives
      permission and would like to obtain more information, study staff will approach them and
      provide them with the consent form to review. Study staff may also contact them by phone to
      explain the study and recruit.

      Subjects will be asked to make 5 visits:

      Visit 1-- consent form, physical exam, vitals, pregnancy test, sleep log

      Visit 2-- sleep questionnaires, urine test for hormones associated with sleep, sleep log,
      placement of EEG

      Visit 3-- remove EEG, beginning of treatment with Bioboosti device, sleep log Treatment
      phase-- subjects use the Bioboosti at home for two weeks

      Visit 4-- return of Bioboosti, sleep questionnaires, urine test for hormones associated with
      sleep, sleep log, placement of EEG

      Visit 5-- remove EEG, collect sleep logs

    <description>Ambulatory EEG will be used before treatment and after treatment, using sleep montage per standard American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria and scored by a registered polysomnography technologist using AASM guidelines. WASO will be reported as the amount of time the subject spent awake after the initiation of sleep during the main sleep period at night; this will be compared before treatment to after treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects indicate the times they went to sleep and the times they woke up throughout the day, by filling in the boxes corresponding to time of day.</description>
