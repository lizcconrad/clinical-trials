    <textblock>
      The three tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are: (i) upper GI malignancies
      (comprising intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal
      cancers).); (ii) neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid
      tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal
      or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer,
      mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa
      cell tumours).

      The role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of
      their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.

      This protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of
      nivolumab &amp; ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare
      cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined
      with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this
      study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these
      cancers.

      Study Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge
      because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these
      malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often
      treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies
      that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are
      often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a
      rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated
      that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every
      year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a
      rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to
      improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer
      immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of
      different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare
      cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed
      here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined,
      with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three
      tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic
      cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours
      (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours
      (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of
      the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma),
      sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response
      rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20
      patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient
      responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be
      broadened to tumour streams.

    <description>CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a key regulator of T cell activity. Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, increasing the number of tumor reactive T effector cells which mobilize to mount a direct T-cell immune attack against tumor cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce T regulatory cell function, which may lead to an increase in anti-tumor immune response.</description>

    <description>A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1,PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs (antigen presenting cells). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.</description>

                  a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status

               -  Men and women, &gt; or = to 18 years of age

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception.
                  WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30
                  days plus the time required for Nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the
                  last dose of investigational drug.

               -  Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
                  IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
                  failure rate of less than 1 percent per year. Men that are sexually active with
                  WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half life of the
                  investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued
                  for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to
                  undergo five half lives. The half life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25
                  days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of the study, men who
                  are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days
                  plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last
                  dose of investigational drug.
