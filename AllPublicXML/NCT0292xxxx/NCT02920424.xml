  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-56022473 following
      multiple subcutaneous (SC) study agent administrations in subjects with Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE) and to determine whether premedication with corticosteroids is required
      to improve the tolerability of SC JNJ-56022473.

  <why_stopped>
    The decision is based on a change in the benefit risk assessment of this drug for the lupus
    population targeted in this study.
