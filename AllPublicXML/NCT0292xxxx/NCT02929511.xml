  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers will investigate the effect of single-file reciprocating
      versus single-file rotational file systems on the postoperative pain in adult patients who
      have necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis. The participants will be assigned by chance to
      separate groups that compare 2 different treatments, reciprocating single-file system
      (Reciproc Blue) and rotational single-file system (OneShape). As a reference, Mtwo multi-file
      (full-sequence) will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The infected root canal treatments will be performed using one-visit approach with either a
      reciprocating single-file system or a continuous rotational single-file system. (Reciproc
      Blue reciprocating single-file system vs OneShape rotational single-file system). The root
      canals will be completed in single-visit. The patients will record their postoperative pain
      during the follow-up period using a VAS scale.

    <description>Endodontic treatment will be performed in teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical periodontitis. Local anaesthesia will be provided (2% Novocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine), isolation with rubber dam and standard access cavity preparation will be done.Using 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite, canal negotiation will be done. Coronal flaring with # 2 and #3 Gates-Glidden drills will be done. The canals will be obturated with gutta-percha and epoxy resin sealer. The treatments will be carried out in single-visit. In this group, intervention will be carried out by the Reciproc motor (VDW, Germany) and Reciproc Blue single-file system (VDW, Germany). The intervention is root canal treatment with the Reciproc Blue single-file system.</description>
