  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve complete remission (CR) following
      induction chemotherapy. However, a large majority subsequently relapse and succumb to the
      disease. Currently, cytogenetics and molecular aberrations are the best prognostic
      indicators; however, these factors cannot prognosticate accurately for individual patients.
      Overall, the majority of patients with favorable or intermediate-risk AML will experience
      relapse. Prognosis after relapse is dismal with a five-year overall survival rate of less
      than 10%. A leukemia stem cell (LSC) paradigm may explain this failure of CR to reliably
      translate into cure. This study is undertaken to determine whether the presence of LSCs has
      prognostic value as well as to determine whether the presence of LSCs has predictive value.
      This study has an observational component, whereby we intent evaluate whether the presence or
      absence of LSCs is prognostic. This study also has an interventional component in which it
      uses LSC status to determine whether favorable and intermediate risk AML patients in CR
      receive consolidation with chemotherapy or allogeneic HCT.
