      This is a prospective, multicentric, comparative, non-randomized interventional study in
      which subjects diagnosed with central precocious puberty (CPP) and early puberty (EP) were
      treated for 6 months to compare the effect with GnRHa and traditional Chinese medicines.

    <textblock>
      740 girls with CPP and EP participated in this study, all participates were divided into
      GnRHa group, traditional chinese medicines group and blank group. After at least six months
      therapy with GnRHa or traditional Chinese medicines, the investigators compare clinical
      parameters, sex hormone, bone age and ovarian ultrasound in three groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Premature appearance of secondary sexual characteristics: girls present with
             development of secondary sexual characteristics before 8, with breast induration as
             the earliest manifestation.

          2. Accelerated linear growth: the annual growth rate is higher than normal.

          3. Advanced bone age: the bone age is 1 or years more than the actual age

          4. Enlargement of sexual glands: B-mode ultrasonography of pelvic cavity indicates the
             volumes of the uterus and ovaries have increased, and multiple ovarian follicles with
             a diameter&gt;4mm can be found in ovaries;

          5. HPGA functions have been primed; serum gonadotropin and sexual hormone levels reach
             pubertal values.

          6. Subjects should be willing and able to follow the study protocol during the study
             period.

          7. Subjects should submit their parents' or guardians' written informed consent before
             initiation of the study procedure with non-normal medical care. They should understand
             that subjects or their parents/guardians may withdraw the consent at any time without
             impairing future medical care. If the child is old enough to read and write, she
             should submit a separate consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with central nervous system diseases and thyroid diseases;

          2. Patients with CHA-induced precocious puberty;

          3. Patients with poor compliance.
