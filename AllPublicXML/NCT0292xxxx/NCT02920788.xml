  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most pressing concerns within the VA currently is the provision of interventions
      that address the cognitive as well as emotional problems faced by Veterans with mild TBI and
      comorbid conditions. When completed, these studies will inform us whether training core
      attentional self-regulatory control functions via personally-relevant activities will be
      effective in improving daily life for Veterans with mild TBI and comorbid conditions. The
      study design will provide a test not only of potential benefits for real life functioning,
      but also determine to what extent these benefits are related to actual changes in
      cognitive/behavioral performance and brain networks corresponding to these functions. This
      project will provide a foundation for future studies to investigate the neural mechanisms
      that support improvements of cognition and behavior in mTBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and co-morbid conditions are prevalent in
      returning Veterans with the reported rates ranging from 14- 22%. Chronic sequela of mTBI can
      be highly debilitating due to deficits in the cognitive control processes, including
      attention, executive functions, and memory. In prior studies, individuals with chronic
      acquired brain injury who participated in a cognitive training program, Goal-Oriented
      Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS), which targets executive control functions of applied
      mindfulness-based attention regulation and goal management, improved cognitive performance in
      areas of: complex attention/executive function and memory, complex functional task
      performance, and daily functioning. Furthermore, functional MRI (fMRI) results after training
      indicated significantly enhanced modulation of neural processing. Preliminary data from
      recently completed randomized-control GOALS study in 32 Veterans with chronic TBI also show
      both short and longer term (up to 2 years) improvements in attention and executive function,
      complex real-life tasks, and emotional regulation.

      The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the potential short and longer term
      effects of GOALS cognitive training program, and to use advanced MRI to investigate changes
      in brain structure and function in the circuits that regulate attention, memory, executive
      function and emotion in Veterans with chronic mTBI.

      The investigators postulate that 1) GOALS training will improve neurocognitive function in
      attention and executive function domains, complex functional task performance, and emotional
      regulation in Veterans with chronic mTBI; 2) improved neurocognitive function will be
      correlated with macrostructural, microstructural and functional changes in the corresponding
      brain networks on high field (3T) and ultra-high field (7T) structural MR imaging, diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI performed pre- and post-training; 3) Changes in
      both behavioral function and imaging measures will be maintained at 6 months post-training
      and be associated with improvements in activities and participation.

      AIM 1: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on neuro-cognitive
      performance and neural plasticity of attention and executive control networks in mTBI.

      AIM 2: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on complex functional
      task performance and daily functioning, and on plasticity in pathways related to memory
      function, in mTBI.

      AIM 3: To determine the short and long term effects of GOALS training on measures of
      emotional regulation, and on plasticity of frontolimbic networks related to emotion
      processing, in mTBI In a randomized, controlled interventional study design, 36 Veterans with
      a history of chronic (&gt; 6 month) mTBI and residual cognitive difficulties will be randomized
      to participate in 5 weeks of cognitive training (GOALS) or a treatment as usual (TAU)
      comparison. At baseline, week 5 (post GOALS), and at 6 months, participants will undergo a
      multi-level assessment battery consisting of: 1) neuroimaging with high field (3T) and
      ultra-high field (7T) structural MR imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state
      fMRI; 2) neuropsychological assessment focusing on complex attention and executive function;
      3) complex 'real life' functional task performance; and 4) self-report measures of daily
      functioning and emotional regulation/heath.

      When completed, this project will determine whether training core attentional self-regulatory
      control functions via personally-relevant activities will be effective in improving quality
      of life and daily functioning for Veterans with mTBI. The study design will provide a test of
      potential benefits on real-life functioning, and also determine to what extent these benefits
      are related to actual changes in hypothetically targeted cognitive/behavioral functions and
      brain networks corresponding to these functions.

    <description>GOALS is a manualized, therapist-administered cognitive training program that targets executive control functions of applied mindfulness-based attention regulation and goal management strategies and links them to participant-defined real-life goals. In contrast to training via practice on isolated tasks, this training protocol involves application of attention regulation skills and strategies to participant-defined goals in real life, ecologically valid settings. One of main training aims is to improve self-regulatory control mechanisms as they contribute to goal attainment.</description>
