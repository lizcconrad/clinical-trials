  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although patients of colorectal cancer use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbal therapy
      extensively in China, no strong evidence exists to demonstrate the safety and survival
      outcomes of TCM herbal therapy combined with conventional western medicine for treatment of
      this disease. The purpose of this multi-center perspective cohort study is to evaluate the
      relationship between TCM herbal therapy and survival outcomes in patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer.
