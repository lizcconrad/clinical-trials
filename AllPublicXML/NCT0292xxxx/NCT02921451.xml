      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term performance of Restorelle system for
      the treatment of uterine prolapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the performance of the Restorelle system, which uses
      Smartmesh - an ultra-lightweight mesh for uterine prolapse management. Most patients undergo
      a hysterectomy i.e. removal of the uterus when they have a prolapse. However, this has often
      been found to be an unnecessary operation. The investigators are studying the use of the
      Restorelle mesh system to preserve the uterus when there is a uterine prolapse.

    <description>Success criteria will be defined through the examination of patient's Prolapse Quantification System Assessment (POPQ) score of C -1 or less and patient's report of bothersome bulge they can see or feel per Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form 20 (PFDI-20) question 3, response of 0 or 1 (i.e. response of &quot;not at all&quot;). Failure to meet this criteria will be considered recurrence of uterine prolapse.</description>
