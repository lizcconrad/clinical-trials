  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the proportion of tracheal intubations for
      which more than one person is necessary when using the McGRATH® MAC videolaryngoscope.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Videolaryngoscopes, such as McGRATH® MAC videolaryngoscope, are used to facilitate tracheal
      intubations. This study is designed to evaluate the proportion of cases requiring more than
      one member of the anesthesiology team when the video feature of McGRATH® MAC is available
      during laryngoscopy in a population of patients without a predicted difficult intubation
      (Arne's score &lt;11).

      General anesthesia from induction until tracheal intubation is recorded on a video for
      further analysis. Analysis includes characteristics of intubation, patient's monitoring and
      cooperation between anesthesiologists in two groups. In the control group, the screen of the
      McGRATH® MAC videolaryngoscope is hidden. In the experimental group, the McGRATH® MAC
      videolaryngoscope is used with its video feature.
