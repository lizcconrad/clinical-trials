  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine
      the effect of high concentrate omega-3 capsules on the omega-3 status of patients with
      non-alcoholic fatty liver.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver (simple steatosis) confirmed within the last year by
      ultrasound or other imaging modality will be recruited to the study. Subjects will be
      randomized to a treatment arm of high concentrate capsules or placebo for a 6 month treatment
      period.Omega-3 content of red blood cells (omega-3 index) will be measured for primary
      endpoint assessment. Quantitative MRI will be performed to determine the effect on liver fat
      content.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented history of clinical diagnosis of NAFLD by ultrasound, MRI or biopsy within
             one (1) year prior to screening (V1). If the diagnostic test date is greater than one
             (1) year, abdominal ultrasound will be repeated at (V1) and must confirm a diagnosis
             of NAFLD.

          2. Men or women, ≥18 years of age.

          3. BMI between 18.0 and 39.9 kg/m2.

          4. Non-smokers (&gt;3 months of non-smoking).

          5. If on a statin regimen, history (&gt; 1 month stable dose) of taking a statin medication
             (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor example: Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor, Pravachol, Lescol,
             Livalo, etc).

          6. Able to understand and cooperate with study procedures, and have signed a written
             informed consent prior to any study procedures.

             suspected cirrhosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis,
             alcoholic steatohepatitis, pancreatitis, or prescription medications known to cause
             liver damage, or known to be hepatotoxic.

          4. Subjects with a history of bariatric surgery.

          5. Significant weight loss (&gt; 5% body weight) or rapid weight loss (&gt;1.6 kg/week), within
