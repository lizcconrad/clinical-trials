  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of X4P-001 plus nivolumab is
      safe and tolerable. Secondly, the study will investigate if adding X4P-001 to nivolumab
      treatment has an effect on the body and the cancer tumor, in patients receiving nivolumab but
      not exhibiting a radiological response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, may result in the generation
      of anti-tumor immune responses. However, the objective radiological response in advanced RCC
      patients was only 21.5%. Therefore, it is important to identify additional therapies that
      could augment the anti-tumor immune activity of checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in an
      increase in the number of patients able to achieve a radiological response to treatment.

      While checkpoint inhibitors facilitate activation of cytotoxic T cells, the agents do not
      impact T cell trafficking. X4P-001, a CXCR4 antagonist, is hypothesized to impact the
      trafficking of immune cell types, for example, decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells
      and increasing cytotoxic T cells at the tumor. Giving X4P-001 treatment in combination with
      nivolumab is hypothesized to increase the clinical response to by providing an influx of T
      cells that can be further activated by the checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, CXCR4 plays a
      role in trafficking of endothelial progenitor cells which mediate angiogenesis. RCC is known
      to be responsive to anti-angiogenic agents, and thus X4P-001 targets a second mechanism of
      tumor growth inhibition.
