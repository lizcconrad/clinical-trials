  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are looking at how people make decisions about
      reward-related items, both monetary and food related after taking either the dopamine agonist
      bromocriptine or the COMT inhibitor tolcapone, in healthy control subjects. Subjects will
      fill self-report questionnaires and undergo an MRI scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to understand how the brain's dopamine system impacts monetary and
      food-related decision making. The investigators aim to use tolcapone and bromocriptine due to
      the temporary change in the levels of dopamine in the brain. The investigators also aim to
      determine if genetics, personality traits, or a family history of alcoholism change how these
      drugs affect decision making.
