  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of using a
      sterile sheath (EndoSheath®) during cystoscopy versus a standard scope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing costs in health care and enhanced infection control requirements necessitate
      the efficient and reliable use of frequently used techniques like cystoscopy. The health
      economics of cystoscopy are dependent on maintaining low levels of post-cystoscopy sequelae
      like urinary tract infection (UTI) and its potential precursors, significant asymptomatic
      bacteriuria and leukocytosis. Another key component of the economics and efficiency of
      cystoscopy is the time and cost related to the reprocessing of these devices in preparation
      for re-use. The use of disposable endoscope sheaths may limit the need for high level
      disinfection (HLD) between procedures and reduce reprocessing time and potentially prolong
      the cystoscope lifespan. The rationale for this study is to determine if a sheathed
      cystoscopy system would provide the desired cost and efficiency advantages compared to
      procedures done with non-sheathed cystoscopes. This is a prospective, randomized, parallel
      group, single center clinical trial to assess the clinical outcomes, practice efficiency and
      health economics of the use of sheathed cystoscopes (EndoSheath® System) compared to using
      standard (non-sheathed) cystoscopes. The study will evaluate the infection control (via the
      change in bacteriuria), clinical practice efficiency and costs of the EndoSheath technology
      with CST 5000 scope compared to standard cystoscopy with Olympus Visera Elite OTV-S190
      digital flexible scope. There will be 30 subjects in the control group undergoing cystoscopy
      with the standard scope at the clinic, the Olympus Visera Elite, and 30 subjects in the study
      group undergoing cystoscopy with the EndoSheath system. The study is designed as a
      prospective, randomized controlled trial. There will be no active blinding of clinicians or
      subjects; however, it is anticipated that most subjects will be unaware of differences in the
      cystoscopy equipment that will be utilized in their routine procedures.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had Post-Procedure Bacteriuria</measure>
    <time_frame>10-14 Days Post Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be the change in bacteriuria pre- and post-procedure between EndoSheath CST-5000 cystoscope and standard (non-sheathed) Olympus Visera Elite OTV-S190 cystoscope during the course of routine clinical use in a urology clinic. The pre-procedure measurement of bacteriuria will occur on the day of the procedure. The post-procedure measurement of bacteriuria will occur approximately two weeks (10-14 days) post-procedure. This will be assessed by urine culture exams.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Cystoscopes With Positive Bioburden Post-procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after cystoscopy.</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after completion of each cystoscopy procedure, the bioburden on the cystoscopes will be evaluated. The flexible cystoscope sheath was removed for bioburden assessment. For each cystoscope, whether sheathed or standard, two locations were assessed - the control body and the shaft. Cultures were obtained wiping the entire surface with sterile saline pledgets. The sample pledgets were placed in 1 ml sterile saline and shaken for 30 seconds. Ten drops of 0.02 ml aliquots from the sample were spotted on two 5% blood agar plates and incubated at 35°C in CO2.</description>

    <measure>Total Time to Reprocess a Cystoscope</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning from the time a cystoscope is withdrawn from the urethral meatus at the end of a procedure until the completion of reprocessing, approximately 3,869 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The total time required for a cystoscope to be reprocessed so that it is available for re-use in a subsequent procedure will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Assessment of Procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 min after the end of procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>After undergoing cystoscopy, patients will be asked to complete Visual Analog Scales (VAS) instruments to determine their level of pain experienced during cystoscopy as well as their perception of discomfort with the procedure. The score range is 0 to 100. Higher scores denotes worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Staff Assessment of Cystoscope Reprocessing.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of day of each procedure during 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of each day while the study is in progress, 6 members of the medical staff directly involved with the reprocessing of cystoscopes will evaluate the ease of reprocessing based on a 5-point Likert scale for the following parameters: ease of Insertion, ease of manipulation, optical quality, overall ease of use. The score range is 0 to 5. Higher score denotes better outcomes. A single value was derived per staff member and summarized for the group as a whole during 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Cost of Cystoscopy Reprocessing</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The health economics of reprocessing will be evaluated by associating personnel hourly costs with cystoscope reprocessing time segments. The total cost was averaged between pre-cleaning, cleaning, disinfection, rinsing, and drying for the 30 cystoscopes in each group for a duration of 6 months.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Had Post-Procedure Bacteriuria</title>
          <description>The primary endpoint will be the change in bacteriuria pre- and post-procedure between EndoSheath CST-5000 cystoscope and standard (non-sheathed) Olympus Visera Elite OTV-S190 cystoscope during the course of routine clinical use in a urology clinic. The pre-procedure measurement of bacteriuria will occur on the day of the procedure. The post-procedure measurement of bacteriuria will occur approximately two weeks (10-14 days) post-procedure. This will be assessed by urine culture exams.</description>

        <description>Immediately after completion of each cystoscopy procedure, the bioburden on the cystoscopes will be evaluated. The flexible cystoscope sheath was removed for bioburden assessment. For each cystoscope, whether sheathed or standard, two locations were assessed – the control body and the shaft. Cultures were obtained wiping the entire surface with sterile saline pledgets. The sample pledgets were placed in 1 ml sterile saline and shaken for 30 seconds. Ten drops of 0.02 ml aliquots from the sample were spotted on two 5% blood agar plates and incubated at 35°C in CO2.</description>
