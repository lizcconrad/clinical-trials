  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether octreotide has an effect on inhibition of the exocrine
      secretion fo the pancreas, which might lower the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula
      after pancreatoduodenectomy. Patients who will undergo pancreatoduodenectomy for
      periampullary tumors were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to intervention (use
      of octreotide) or placebo groups. Octreotide was injected subcutaneously every 8 hours for 7
      days. Every patients will undergo pancreaticojejunostomy with external stent for remnant
      pancreas management. The pancreatic juice is drained through the external stent by negative
      pressure and amounted.

      Primary endpoint was the amount of pancreatic juice for each postoperative day. Secondary
      endpoint was the rate of pancreatic fistula.

      This study aims to examine whether octreotide has an effect on inhibition of the exocrine
      secretion fo the pancreas, which might lower the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula
      after pancreatoduodenectomy. Patients who will undergo pancreatoduodenectomy for
      periampullary tumors were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to intervention (use
      of octreotide) or placebo groups. Octreotide of 100ug(1mL) was injected subcutaneously just
      before operation and every 8 hours for 7 days postoperatively. The placebo group was managed
      with normal saline (1mL) for same period. Every patients will undergo pancreaticojejunostomy
      with external stent for remnant pancreas management. The pancreatic juice is drained through
      the external stent by negative pressure (Barovac) and amounted.

      Postoperative care of patients was same between groups such as pain control and supportive
      care. The amount of drained pancreatic juice via external stent was recorded everyday.

      Primary endpoint was the amount of pancreatic juice for each postoperative day. Secondary
      endpoint was the rate of pancreatic fistula.
