    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial based on split-body was planned to compare the
      efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser and 311-nm Ti:Sapphire laser in patients with vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 308-nm excimer laser (EL) has been widely used for localized vitiligo. Recently, the
      311-nm Ti:Sapphire laser (TSL) was developed to treat patients with vitiligo. To compare the
      efficacy of TSL vs. EL in the treatment of vitiligo.

      A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial based on split-body was planned. The paired
      symmetric vitiliginous lesions will be randomized to either TSL or EL treatment groups. All
      lesions will be treated twice weekly for a total of 12-week period. The degree of
      repigmentation will be assessed as % from baseline by using a computer program every 4 weeks,
      and the non-inferiority margin was set at 10%. Overall 16 patients will be enrolled.
