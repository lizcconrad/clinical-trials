  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ixazomib citrate, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      work in treating patients with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal
      gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving ixazomib citrate, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone may work better in
      treating patients with POEMS syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Normalization of VEGF after 3 cycles of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity and safety of the combination of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib), lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone.

      II. Hematologic response after 3 cycles of therapy. III. Hematologic response rates and/or
      VEGF response at 12 months. IV. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Improvement of peripheral neuropathy (Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale [ONLS],
      Modified Neurological Impairment Score for POEMS [mNIS+7POEMS], and performance score),
      ascites/effusions, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after 3 cycles
      of therapy.

      II. Improvement of peripheral neuropathy (ONLS, mNIS+7POEMS, and performance score),
      ascites/effusions, DLCO, and positron emission tomography (PET)-scan (if abnormal at
      baseline) at 12 months (both groups) and at 24 and 36 months (group 2 only).

      III. Time to VEGF response, hematologic response, and clinical response. IV. Time to VEGF
      progression, hematologic progression, and clinical progression.

      V. Doses delivered will be tabulated to establish tolerance of study drugs. VI. To describe
      changes in bone biomarkers with treatment of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide PO
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo standard of care autologous stem cell transplant
      (ASCT) after completing 3 courses of treatment.

      GROUP II: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO, lenalidomide PO QD, and dexamethasone PO as
      in Group I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months and then every 6
      months for up to 36 months.
