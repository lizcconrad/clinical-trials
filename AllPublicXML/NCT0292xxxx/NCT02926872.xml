    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is the development of a clinical profile of pediatric
      patients with LAL-D, which will enable the Sponsor to provide more focused guidance to the
      medical community as to which pediatric patients should be tested for LAL-D.

    <measure>Eligibility Criteria for LAL-D diagnosed patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Confirmed LAL-D diagnosed patients, for a period extending up to a maximum of 6 months after the date of diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Eligibility criteria will be summarized descriptively by LAL-D diagnostic status. Statistical differences in the distributions of eligibility criteria by diagnostic status will be assessed with t test for continuous variables (e.g., lab values) and chi-square test/Fishers exact test for categorical variables (e.g., presence of hepatomegaly). Among those with confirmed LAL-D, demographic data (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, and country of origin) and clinical data (i.e., laboratory values, imaging and biopsy data, medications, physical exam findings, medical history, and family medical history) will be summarized as appropriate</description>

    <measure>LIPA gene mutations for LAL-D diagnosed patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Confirmed LAL-D diagnosed patients, for a period extending up to a maximum of 6 months after the date of diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LAL-D, specific LIPA gene mutations and type of mutation will be summarized. Listings will present patient characteristics, including signs, symptoms, and laboratory values by mutation. Patient (e.g., age) and clinical features (e.g., laboratory values, signs, and symptoms) will be summarized by genetic mutation to assess associations between phenotypes and genetic variants.</description>

        that these abnormalities are of unknown or unconfirmed etiology and the patient has not

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient is ≥ 2 to ≤ 16 years of age at the date of informed consent.
             (Note: Female patients who are of childbearing potential or are pregnant may
             participate in this study.)

          2. Patient or patient's parent or legal guardian (if applicable) consents to
             participation in the study. If the patient is of minor age, he/she is willing to
             provide assent where required per local regulations, and if deemed able to do so.

          3. Patient meets all components of Criterion A and/or Criterion B below.

        Criterion A: Patient has dyslipidemia, defined as having at least one of the following
        lipid abnormalities based on a local laboratory result obtained within 3 months prior to
        the date of informed consent (or at the screening visit, as applicable):

        LDL-c ≥ 130 mg/dL HDL c ≤ 40 mg/dL (male patients) or ≤ 50 mg/dL (female patients) Note:
        For patients receiving a lipid-lowering medication (LLM), the patient must have been on a
        stable dose of the LLM for at least 4 weeks prior to the serum lipid result.

        AND

        Patient has at least one of the following liver or spleen abnormalities:

        Hepatomegaly, as determined by the investigator based on a physical examination or imaging
        procedure; Splenomegaly, as determined by the investigator based on a physical examination
        or imaging procedure; ALT &gt;75 U/L or ALT &gt;1.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) (based on
        age- and gender-specific normal ranges of the local laboratory performing the assay) within
        3 months prior to the date of informed consent (or at the screening visit, as applicable).

        Criterion B: Patient has steatosis (microvesicular or mixed macro/microvesicular), hepatic
        fibrosis, and/or cirrhosis of unknown etiology, as determined from a liver biopsy performed
        within the previous 3 years. (Note: For patients who have received a liver transplantation,
        the liver biopsy results must have been obtained prior to the date of the liver
        transplantation.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a confirmed cause of liver disease other than LAL-D.

          2. Patient has genetically confirmed heterozygous familial hypercholesteremia or other
             secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia.

          3. Patient has current evidence of neurological dysfunction and/or a history of
             neurological dysfunction within one year prior to the date of informed consent.

          4. Patient has been previously screened for LAL-D and found to have normal enzyme
             activity based on the reference range of the laboratory performing the assay.

          5. Patient is currently receiving treatment with sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) or has
             previously participated in a clinical study with sebelipase alfa (Kanuma).
