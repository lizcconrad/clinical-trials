    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigation is to assess iodine status of pregnant women at week 16 of
      gestation targeting serum thyroglobulin as a biomarker of iodine deficiency. The
      investigators aim to assess whether pre-gestational initiation of iodine supplementation is
      more advantageous in comparison to supplementation start at the time of pregnancy detection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild iodine deficiency is still a public health issue in many industrialized countries,
      especially during pregnancy. During the last decade there was no monitoring of the iodine
      status in pregnancy in Hungary.

      Since urinary iodine concentration (UIC) only reflects recent iodine intake and carries
      limited information on individual existing iodine stores, another biomarker e.g. measurement
      of serum thyroglobulin concentration, would be useful to gain comprehensive information. In
      the present study, the purpose of the investigation is to compare UIC, UIC normalized to
      creatinine concentration and serum thyroglobulin as biomarkers of iodine supply in pregnant
      women in a geographical region where previously iodine deficiency had been found.

      UIC, serum thyroglobulin level and thyroid function are measured, and information about
      iodine supplementation and smoking before and during pregnancy are recorded.
