    <textblock>
      The cycloergometer is a mechanical device consisting of a bicycle frame fixed on a support
      base, designed to measure the amount of muscle work performed during exercise and the
      resistance to pedaling. The cycloergometer has been already employed in many fields of
      medicine.

      However, up to date, a little use of cycloergometer in the management of chronic joint
      diseases has been documented and scientific studies have not clarified if cycloergometer is
      effective in these diseases and, particularly, in Rotator Cuff Tear patients.

      To evaluate the effects of cycloergometer on pain during activities (primary outcome) and
      shoulder functionality, the investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled study
      (pilot study) in patients with a symptomatic full-thickness RCT.

      Since cycloergometer works through a continuous active and passive joint mobilization, the
      investigators expect it can reduce pain and improve shoulder functionality becoming a useful
      tool for physicians in the management of RCT patients.
