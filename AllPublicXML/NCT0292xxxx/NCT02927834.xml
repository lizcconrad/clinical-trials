  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common disease that effects millions of people world wide.
      Despite its frequency it is unclear what treatment options are the best for these patients.
      Typically patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) are given a long
      term antibiotic (3 weeks), nasal steroid sprays, saline nasal irrigation and occasionally
      oral steroids. Oral steroids benefit patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps
      (CRSwNP) however their role in non polyp patients is less clear. It is the goal of this study
      to see if oral steroids benefit the treatment outcomes in those patients with chronic
      rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. In addition this study will look to see if a short
      course (5 day burst) versus a longer course (21 day taper) of oral steroids make a difference
      in outcomes.

      The investigators will compare patients with CRSsNP who are treated with antibiotics/nasal
      steroid sprays, and compare them to chronic sinusitis patients who receive antibiotics/nasal
      steroid spray along with a course of oral steroids. The goal is to determine if oral steroids
      have a role in CRSsNP, and if so, the most effective dosage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. They have three-months of persistent symptoms meeting criteria for chronic
             rhinosinusitis as defined by the taskforce on rhinosinusitis.

          2. They have a CT-scan in the clinic or have a viewable recent (&lt; 3 weeks prior to clinic
             visit) CT-scan with a Lund Mackay score of 6 or greater. A Lund Mackay score of 6 or
             greater is felt to be indicative of at least moderate CRS.

          3. They do not have nasal polyps on initial clinic nasal endoscopy

          4. They are willing to participate in a clinical study

          5. They are between the ages of 18 to 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. They have a condition in which the use of systemic corticosteroids is contraindicated
             such as diabetes will be excluded.

          2. They are unable to or unwilling to take the prescribed antibiotics or steroids will
             excluded.

             will also be excluded.

          4. They have variants of chronic sinusitis known to be refractory to medical therapy such
             as Wegener's granulomatosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia or sarcoidosis.

          5. They have sinusitis secondary to prior surgery, a dental procedure or anatomical
             variants.

          6. They have nasal polyps on physical exam.

          7. They are pregnant. Subjects who are possibly pregnant will be excluded based on
             history. Pregnancy testing is not standard of care for diagnostic imaging.

          8. They have a Lund-Mackay score on CT scan of &lt; 6

          9. They are &lt; 18 or &gt; 80 years old
