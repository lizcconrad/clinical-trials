    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect representative clinical images (head and whole-body
      scans) of demonstrated diagnostic quality using the next-generation SIGNA PET/MR device
      equipped with investigational software components in adult population. The images and summary
      data from this study are intended for use in regulatory submission.

      Primary Objective: To demonstrate diagnostic image quality of image sets with ZTE MRAC and Q
      Static (Q. MRAC) for SIGNA PET/MR in representative clinical cases of the general imaging
      population.

      Secondary Objective(s): To verify diagnostic acceptability, ease of use, and functionality of
      ZTE MRAC and Q Static (Q. MRAC) for SIGNA PET/MR at clinical sites.

      Safety Objective(s): To collect information about safety events and device issues.

    <description>The GE SIGNA PET/MR MP26 software platform includes the zero echo time (ZTE) scan for head attenuation and Q.Static. The ZTE MR software feature has the potential to enable better visualization of bones, including those in the head, by employing optimal head attenuation correction in PET/MR.

             injection;

          4. Can hear without assistive devices and have necessary mental capacity to follow study
             instructions;

          5. Are willing and able to provide written informed consent;

          6. Are considered eligible for MRI and PET exams, according to site institutional safety
             policies.

        Exclusion Criteria:
