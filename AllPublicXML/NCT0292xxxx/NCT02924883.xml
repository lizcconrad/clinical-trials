      This Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with atezolizumab
      or atezolizumab-placebo in participants with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic BC
      who have received prior trastuzumab and taxane based therapy, either alone or in combination,
      and/or who have progressed within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy.
