  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of generation of biological samples (in blood and urine) positive to
      Epoetin alfa for laboratories that wish to perform the analysis of doping controls and
      maintain accreditation from World Anti-Doping Agency.

    <description>Urine samples will be collected in different time periods: -48 to -24h, - 24h to 0h (pre-administration), 0 to 24h, 24 to 48h, 48 to 72h, 72 to 96h, 96 to 120h and 120 to 144h (post-administration). 10 mL of blood and dried blood spot (DBS) microvolume sampling with FTA DMPK -C cards will be collected at different time points: 48-72 hours before the first administration of the drug, before administration (0h, baseline), at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after administration of the drug. In session 5, blood samples will be collected at 0h (pre-administration) and at 1h, 4h and 8h after the administration of the drug.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male volunteers aged from 18 to 50 years.

          2. A health profile devoid of organic or physiological disorders.

          3. The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should
             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted
             if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are
             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be
             justified in writing specifically.

          4. Body mass index (BMI=weigh/height2) will range between 19 and 27 Kg/m2 and weight
             between 50 and 110 kg.

          5. Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent
             form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non compliance of the inclusion criteria.

          2. Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the three months prior to
             start this study.

          3. A prior history of or presence of significant cardiovascular, neurological,
             haematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine,
             immunologic or renal disease that, in the investigator's opinion, considering the
             current state of the art, they are clinically significant, are life-threatening for
             the subjects and could interfere with the product assessment; or which may lead to
             suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion, or
             that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs.

          4. History or clinical evidence of psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse, or
             regular use of psychoactive drugs.

          5. History of hypertension, seizures, endocrine disorders (such as diabetes and
             hypothyroidism), coagulation disorders, kidney and/or liver disease.

          6. Subjects for which the drug involved in the study is counter indicated.

          7. Smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day.

          8. Taking more than 35 g of alcohol per day.

          9. Drinking more than 5 drinks containing xanthines per day.

         10. Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions. The treatment with
             single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the week prior to the
             study sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is calculated that it has been
             cleared completely the day of the experimental session.

         11. Have taken part in studies with blood donation in the last 8 weeks prior to start this
             study.

         12. History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active
             substance or any excipients.

         13. Have been volunteer in another study with drugs in the last 3 months prior to start
             this study.

         14. Subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B, C or HIV.

         15. Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures
             requested to be followed.
