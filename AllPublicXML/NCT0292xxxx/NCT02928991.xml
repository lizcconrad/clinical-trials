  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine whether fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning
      (RIC) regimens facilitate successful donor engraftment of patients with acquired aplastic
      anemia (AA) and Inherited bone marrow failure (iBMF) syndromes undergoing Matched related
      donor bone marrow transplant (MRD-BMT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired AA patients will receive the experimental regimen of fludarabine with dose-reduced
      cyclophosphamide, with results in this prospective single arm experimental group evaluated in
      the context of our institutional historical experience using HD Cy regimens as well as
      published outcomes using both fludarabine and high-dose cyclophosphamide-based regimens for
      MRD-BMT in aplastic anemia. iBMF syndrome patients will receive one of two
      fludarabine-containing regimens based on disease characteristics, and our outcomes will be
      compared to previously published data using a variety of regimens. Graft versus host disease
      (GvHD) prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine/tacrolimus alone for patients with acquired
      AA or cyclosporine/tacrolimus plus mycophenolate for patients with iBMF syndromes. For both
      acquired AA and iBMF syndrome patients, donor chimerism will be assessed at scheduled
      intervals following BMT and will be used to define patients with full donor or mixed
      chimerism for comparisons of survival, graft failure, cytogenetic, GvHD, and immune
      reconstitution outcomes.
