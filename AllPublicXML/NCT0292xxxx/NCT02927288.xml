  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new test to help diagnose mild traumatic brain
      injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers. Chemicals in the brain
      will be measured using a Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scan. In the study, the
      investigators will compare the information they obtain from scans of participants with mTBI,
      PTSD or both, to scans from healthy volunteers to understand the differences between these
      groups. If the results can tell the difference between participants with mTBI and PTSD, the
      investigators should be able to help safely diagnose patients in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soldiers from the US Army, with well characterized diagnosis of mTBI or PTSD, will be
      recruited in the first year as will age-matched healthy controls from the military and
      civilian populations. MRI, single voxel MRS, and two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (2D
      COSY) MRS will be acquired from each participant at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).
      This data will be anonymized and transferred to the Draper Laboratories. Biomarkers for each
      disease will be identified by comparison with control data. These biomarkers will then be fed
      into classifiers that will then be validated with a similar cohort acquired in the second
      year. The second cohort of subjects will then be incorporated into the classifier algorithms
      for a stronger and more robust classification from which a diagnostic test will emerge. To
      test this diagnostic evaluation the data analysis by both BWH and Draper labs will be blinded
      to the characterization of the participants and from the MRS results, the investigators will
      predict if the participant has mTBI, PTSD, both, or neither. Finally, all data will then be
      fused into the algorithms to provide a final classifier. The results of the final classifier
      will then be correlated with clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical indices of
      mTBI and PTSD. These correlations will provide the most complete biochemical analysis of mTBI
      and PTSD which may lead to insight into alternate pathways for drug development.
