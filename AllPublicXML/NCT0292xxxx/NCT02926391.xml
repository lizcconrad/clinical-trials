      Multicenter study allowing to include the first sixty patients implanted with a custom-made
      corpectomy implant (UNiD 3D VBR): 30 patient implanted in cervical region and 30 patients
      implanted in thoracolumbar region.

      The main objective is to confirm feasibilty and safety of patient-specific implants for one
      or multi-level corpectomy and fusion.

      This study was approved in March 2016 allowing to include retrospectivley all patients since
      the first implantation in January 2015 and prospectively all patients after the approval.

      Anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion (ACCF) has been demonstrated as a good alternative
      to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy
      (CSM). However, the use of vertebral body replacement (VBR) cages is technically demanding,
      especially to adjust the size of the cage to the defect without compromising the endplate
      integrity increasing the risk of subsidence. Beside recent studies advocating the interest of
      the shape, size and design of an implant to achieve fusion and stability in cervical spinal
      diseases indications, 3D printing offering rapid and patient-specific manufacturing has
      emerged over the past years. Several materials and technologies can be used and clinical and
      radiological data are still sparse.
