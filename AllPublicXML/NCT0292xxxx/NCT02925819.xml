  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect in a prospective registry all cases of French
      patients undergoing an assessment for percutaneous treatment of mitral valve disease on a
      native valve or due to deterioration after surgical valve repair or replacement. In these
      patients, valvular surgery should be considered contra-indicated or at prohibitive risk. This
      registry will evaluate the morbidity and mortality up to 24 months for those patients with
      severe mitral valve disease who are not included in a clinical trial. The association of
      demographic, clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic variables and treatment options with
      morbidity and mortality will be evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic severe mitral valve disease will have a medical evaluation visit
      (physical examination, ECG, biology) with transthoracic ± transesophageal echocardiography in
      each center. If the patient is considered not eligible for surgery by the heart-team and is
      not included in a clinical trial, the investigator informs the patient of the existence of
      the registry and verifies that it does not express opposition to the use of its clinical
      data.

      In each participating center, demographic information, clinical, laboratory,
      echocardiographic and treatment options will be collected and reported in an electronic case
      report form (e-CRF). Each center will be responsible of patient monitoring, including phone
      call at 6 months and a medical visit at 1 and 2 years. Transthoracic echocardiography will
      also be performed at 1 year and 2 years.
