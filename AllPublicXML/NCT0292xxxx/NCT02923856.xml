  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the resistant rate of the Helicobacter pylori to some common antibiotics was rising，the
      eradication rate of the Helicobacter pylori with the standard triple therapy failed to exceed
      70% in China，and had to drop out of the first-line treatment recommendations. However, with
      the increase of treatment time, patients burden, adverse reactions of antibiotics or proton
      pump inhibitor (PPI) will also increase. Resistance to clarithromycin is the major cause of
      the failure to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. But, in terms of population, there are still
      more than 70% of the patients with clarithromycin sensitive. Under the guidance with
      susceptibility test，7-day standard triple therapy could be used. In this study, investigators
      will select the patients with infection of H. pylori and with clarithromycin sensitive.
      Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with triple therapy based on accurate susceptibility
      testing of clarithromycin will be studied. The treatment time will be assigned into 7 days,10
      days and 14 days groups. Then, investigators will perform a sequencing for failed treatment
      patients in groups, such as drug resistance gene mutation, phenotype and genotype. Finally,
      investigators will compare the differences between the patients with triple therapy and
      traditional quadruple therapy.The incidence of adverse effects in the eradicate treatment
      will reduce at least 10% and avoid patients' unnecessary economic losses at least 400RMB per
      person.
