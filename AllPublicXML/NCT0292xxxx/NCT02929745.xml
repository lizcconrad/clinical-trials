    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how genetics play a role in psoriasis.
      Specifically, a genetic allele HLA-Cw6 is known to be associated with psoriasis, and this
      study aims to find out how it affects genetic and protein expression in patients with
      psoriasis, compared to healthy people, at a single-cell level using a novel flow cytometry
      and RNA-sequencing protocol.
