  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a comprehensive group education combined
      with a lifestyle &quot;activation&quot; program that includes (a) sleep hygiene course, (b) physical
      activity promotion, and (c) bright light therapy, can improve both sleep quality and
      cognitive function among 96 community-dwelling older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      96 community-dwelling older adults with sleep complaints will be randomized into either a
      6-month life style and sleep activation intervention program or a waitlist control group
      (participants in this group will be offered an abbreviated version of the program upon
      completion of the 6 month study). There are 3 measurement sessions to measure cognition,
      sleep, and physical activity at the onset of the study, the midway (3 month) point, and
      completion (at 6 months).

    <description>Participants randomized into this group will undergo a 4 week sleep hygiene course (classes 1x/week for 1.5 hours), followed by a 20 week lifestyle activation program. During the 20 week lifestyle activation program, participants wear a Fit Bit and receive a call from a fitness professional every other week for motivation and recommendations, and receive a bright light therapy program from a sleep expert based on their initial sleep results at the baseline measurement session.</description>

After completion of the final measurement session (6 months), participants will be offered an abbreviated version of the Life Style and Sleep Group intervention including the sleep hygiene course, consultation with sleep expert to go over individual sleep patterns and be given recommendations, along with physical activity recommendations from a fitness expert.</description>
