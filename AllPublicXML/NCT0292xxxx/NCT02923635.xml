      The aim of this study is to asses the oncological safety of oncoplastic breast surgery, and
      its impact on patient satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      This non-randomized prospective trial was conducted on70 female patients presented to
      tertiary breast unit-Ain Shams University hospitals with breast cancer during the period from
      September 2012 to February 2013. All patients sharing in the study signed an informed consent
      that was approved in the ethical committee held on April 2012. Patients were classified in
      two groups each one 35 patients: group (A) standard wide local excision and group (B)
      oncoplastic group. Standard wide local excision done by general breast surgeons while
      oncoplastic surgeries done by breast surgeon assisted by plastic surgeon. The following data
      were recorded: Age, family history, margin length, weight and volume of the specimen, margin
      status and patient satisfaction.
