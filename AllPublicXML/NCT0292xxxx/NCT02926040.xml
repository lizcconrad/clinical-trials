  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A. Pancreatic cancer background In 2012, 1,172 new pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed
      in Switzerland. Only 20% of the patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer are
      candidates for surgical resection, the only potential treatment for cure. Over 30% of the
      patients initially present with locally advanced disease. Patients with locally advanced
      disease have no evidence of metastatic spread to the liver, lung, and peritoneum but present
      with local involvement of vital structures that prohibits reasonable tumor resection.
      Currently, those patients are evaluated for palliative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy.
      However, even with best conventional medical therapy, median survival of patients with
      locally advanced disease is mostly below 1 year. Over the last years, loco-regional therapies
      gained increased attention including radiofrequency-, cryo-, and microwave ablation as well
      as electrochemotherapy. However, all those entities are criticized by their complication
      rates leading to morbidity and mortality, limited area of application given the complex
      anatomical structures around the pancreas, and ill-defined improvements in overall survival.

      B. Irreversible electroporation (IRE):

      Irreversible electroporation is an emerging ablative modality that gained enormous interest
      over the last five years. For locally advanced pancreatic cancer, it was introduced in 2009.
      IRE is mainly non-thermal and primarily works through apoptosis. Its well studied safety
      profile allows ablation also within the context of locally advanced pancreatic cancer given
      it mainly spares vessels from destruction.

      Increasing evidence shows that IRE for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is
      effective compared to historic controls with a significant prolongation of local progression
      free survival, distant progression free survival and overall survival. The improvement in
      overall survival is about double the amount of what is seen with best new chemotherapy and
      chemoradiation regimens used at the present time. Those results are even more impressive
      given the discouraging improvements among palliative systemic options.

      The NanoKnife IRE device (Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY) is commonly used to perform IRE
      procedures in pancreatic cancer patients and is commercially available since 2009 and got
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K clearance for soft tissue ablation in October 2011 in
      the United States.

      C. Quality of life and nutritional status/long term outcomes Given the overall poor long-term
      outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures
      are of utmost importance when treatment recommendations are discussed with patients. This is
      especially true for patients with more advanced staged disease where definitive surgical
      resection with curative intent is not possible. However, HRQoL reports for patients with
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing IRE are very limited. To the best of the
      investigators' knowledge, no other specific investigations exist that assessed HRQoL measures
      for patients undergoing IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, no specific assessment
      exists that focuses on nutritional status for this patient group. In addition, impact on
      local and distant recurrence as well as cancer-specific and overall survival are still
      ill-defined and further information is needed.
