    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) candidate vaccine when first administered via intramuscular
      (IM) injection according to a 0, 1-month schedule to RSV-seropositive infants aged 12 to 23
      months.

      The RSV PED-002 study, designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      the RSV candidate vaccine when administered in 3 sequential doses to seropositive infants
      aged 12 to 23 months, will be conducted in an observer-blind manner in Epoch 1 and
      single-blinded in Epoch 2.
