      Bipolar disorder patients frequently presents recurring episodes and often experience
      subsyndromal symptoms, cognitive impairment and difficulties in the functioning with a low
      quality of life, relapses of disease and recurring hospitalization. Early diagnosis and
      appropriate intervention may play a role in preventing the neuroprogressive course of bipolar
      illness. The new technologies represent an opportunity to develop psychological standardized
      treatments using internet devices that minimizing the limitations of face to face treatments
      because of its accessibility that allow adjusting to the availability of each user. However,
      although exist many online psychological programs through web and mobile devices for bipolar
      disorder, there is not evidence about their efficacy and effectiveness due to the variability
      in measures and methodology used.

      Future Internet Social and Technological Alignment Research (FI-STAR) clinical trial is a
      randomized simple blind evaluation within an European project. FISTAR is developed to compare
      this technical solution with treatment as usual. Bipolar disorder patients are to be included
      and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) the experimental group (tele-care
      support) and the control group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline
      (pre-treatment) and at post-treatment.
