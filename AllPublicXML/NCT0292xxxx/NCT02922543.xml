      To understand the safety and efficacy of Revlimid® 5 mg Capsules (hereinafter referred to as
      Revlimid) in patients with &quot;relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&quot; (hereinafter referred to
      as &quot;relapsed or refractory MM&quot;) who have received long-term treatment with it under the
      actual condition of use.

        1. Planned registration period This period started on the date of initial marketing of
           Revlimid and will end at the time when the planned number of patients to be enrolled,
           300, is reached (estimated to be approximately 1 year and 3 moths).

        2. Planned surveillance period This period started on the date of initial marketing of
           Revlimid and will end 3 years after the last enrolled patient begins receiving Revlimid
           (estimated to be approximately 4 years and 3 months).
