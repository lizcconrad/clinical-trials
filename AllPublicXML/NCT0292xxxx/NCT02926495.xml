  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a serious public health issue, affecting approximately 30% of adults.
      Hypertension greatly contributes to the risk for heart disease and stroke, both among the top
      three leading causes of death in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. While most treated
      individuals with hypertension are controlled on medication, diet and exercise, an estimated
      12% are resistant to conventional medical intervention. Alternative effective treatments are
      still needed for this hypertensive patient population to mitigate the risk and incidence of
      mortality and morbidity.

      This original Investigational Device Application is for a study intended to confirm the
      safety and efficacy of bilateral subcutaneous median nerve stimulation using the eCoin system
      to treat resistant hypertension. The eCoin device delivers electrical stimulation pulses to
      the median nerve from a small coin sized device placed under the skin of the distal anterior
      forearm. The implant delivers a weekly 30 minute treatment based on previous studies showing
      a long lasting and cumulative effect. The safety and efficacy of eCoin therapy has previously
      been demonstrated in a multinational, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study in New
      Zealand, Taiwan and Canada.

      This trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, 1:1 randomized sham-controlled study
      of the safety and effectiveness of eCoin median nerve neuromodulation in subjects with
      drug-treatment resistant hypertension. The eCoin neuromodulation device will be implanted
      subcutaneously in the right and left forearms of patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      despite treatment with 3 or more antihypertensive agents. After a 4 week implant healing
      period, subjects will be 1:1 randomized into either a treatment or control group. One half of
      the subjects have their devices activated (treatment) and the other half undergo a sham
      activation (control) to maintain participant blinding to their treatment allocation. During
      the six months post-randomization, the eCoin is ON in the treatment group and OFF in the
      control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual is ≥30 and &lt;75 years of age at the time of randomization.

          -  Individual is receiving a stable medication regimen including maximally tolerated
             doses of 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications of different classes, of which one
             must be a diuretic (with no changes for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening) that
             is expected to be maintained without changes for at least 6 months post randomization.

          -  Individual has an office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and ≤180 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg
             and ≤110 mmHg measured at an initial screening visit and a confirmatory baseline
             visit.

          -  Individual has a 24 hour ambulatory systolic BP of ≥135 mmHg and ≤175 mmHg at
             baseline.
