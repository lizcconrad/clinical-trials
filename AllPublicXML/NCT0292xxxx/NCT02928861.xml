  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prognostic model of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can predict disease progression
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators develop a prognostic model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT and test its
      ability for prognostic value in patients with DLBCL. PET/CT scans evaluation using the liver
      SUVmax as reference. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than
      the threshold (1.6 fold of liver SUVmax) or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. 18F-FDG PET/CT-based
      prognostic model includes PET/CT image, dominant clinical and pathological prognostic factors
      to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL.

    <description>18F-FDG PET/CT will be conducted before, during and after chemotherapy. Patients were instructed to fast for at least 6 h before PET. The blood glucose level was measured to ensure that it was &lt;200 mg/ dL. 18F-FDG was intravenously administered at a dose of 3.7 MBq/kg. Approximately 60 Â± 10 min post- injection, a whole-body acquisition commenced in 6-8 bed positions (1 min/bed) using a hybrid system (PHILIPS Gemini TF) and covered from the base of the skull to the upper thigh, which was followed by CT in a non-contrast phase (modulated 100 mAs; 120 kV; slice thickness, 3 mm) for attenuation correction and anatomical localization purposes. The head acquisition was performed in one bed position (8-10 min/bed).</description>
