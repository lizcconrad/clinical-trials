      With the comparative effectiveness research methods and hospital registration study approach,
      the purpose of this study is to objectively record the methods, efficacy and its influencing
      factors of COPD commonly used treatment methods/programs (Western medicine, Traditional
      Chinese Medicine and Integrative Medicine) in the actual medical environment, analysis of
      application characteristics for the different programs, and provide the basis for its
      revision and promotion. It is a first registration study for COPD in China.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major disease of harm public health
      seriously. Although different treatment methods / programs (Western medicine, Traditional
      Chinese Medicine and Integrative Medicine) exist and are being developed to relieve symptoms
      and reduce mortality in COPD, most have only been studied in randomized controlled trials
      (RCT).

      Most RCT study patients usually require a single disease, the use of standard treatment and a
      single intervention to evaluate interventions in an ideal state can achieve maximum
      effect,that is theoretical effect, it is difficult to provide the evidence of practical
      clinical efficacy or effectiveness. Secondly, RCT often require strict inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, resulting in inadequate representation of the study, thus limiting its
      conclusions spread to overall. There are some challenges for different treatment methods on
      the actual effect of the patients in the evaluation of conventional medical practice with
      RCT.

      Real World Research based on clinical practice pay close attention highly in response to
      these problems, and the registry study had been applied widely in clinical practice. With the
      comparative effectiveness research methods and hospital registration study approach, based on
      the classes of medications recommended by 2014 GOLD and Chinese Treatment Guidelines for
      COPD, the purpose of this study is to objectively record the methods, efficacy and its
      influencing factors of COPD commonly used treatment methods/programs (Western medicine,
      Traditional Chinese Medicine and Integrative Medicine) in the actual medical environment,
      analysis of application characteristics for the different programs, and provide the basis for
      its revision and promotion. This is a first registration study for COPD in China.
