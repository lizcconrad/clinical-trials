  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective multi-centre observational study to evaluate a portable
      magnetocardiograph device for the rule-out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients who
      present to the emergency department with chest pain and other symptoms consistent with ACS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few, if any, studies have evaluated the rule-out (R/O) of non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS
      which requires the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the test to approach
      100%. An alternative triage approach, utilizing a portable magnetocardiography (MCG)
      instrument in the emergency setting, may lead to a more accurate R/O for NSTEMI, UA, and
      clinically significant non-ACS coronary artery disease (CAD), in patients presenting to the
      ED with chest pain. MCG in the emergency setting is a new use of this non-invasive technique
      and may serve as an adjunctive aid that can improve cardiac triage for NSTE ACS and
      clinically significant CAD.This raises the research question of whether MCG may be useful for
      the early triage of patients with acute chest pain. In the study protocol, a clinical
      evaluation is defined that will assess the ability of a portable MCG instrument, using a
      fixed algorithm, to R/O ACS, with improved safety (i.e. &lt;&lt; 2% false negative rate) in
      patients presenting to an emergency setting with chest pain.
