      Florida Cardiovascular Quality Network Application of Clinical Decision Support Software
      Tools at the Point of Care in Patients with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease - a Quality
      Outcomes Registry
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Florida Cardiovascular Quality Network (FCQN) is a quality outcomes registry. In a
      diverse group of clinical sites in Florida, a large number of patients with known or possible
      stable ischemic cardiovascular disease (SIHD) referred for cardiovascular stress test will be
      enrolled in this quality demonstration registry. This registry is based on the hypothesis
      that evidence-based clinical guidelines and appropriate use criteria (AUC), when provided at
      the site and time of care (point of care), may improve physician clinical decisions and,
      thus, the overall quality and value of care for individual patients and populations.
      Specifically, this study registry will utilize multiple proven software tools at the point of
      care: (1) Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) as the method of measurement of patient angina
      symptoms; (2) FOCUS, American College of Cardiology (ACC) software to provide clinical
      decision support (CDS) as the primary method of determination of AUC in patients with a
      clinical indication for a cardiovascular stress test; (3) CATH/PCI, ACC / National
      Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) to provide clinical decision support as the primary
      method of determination of AUC in the cardiac catheterization laboratory; (4) PINNACLE,
      ACC/NCDR clinical registry to provide an extensive database of clinical quality metrics; and
      (5) ACC CARDIOSMART software modules as the primary patient education tool for effective risk
      factor modification. The application of these clinically proven software tools, all applied
      at the point of patient care, may assist physician compliance with ACC guideline based AUC
      and may directly result in an increase in SIHD patients treated with guideline directed
      medical treatment as well as guideline directed interventional treatment. It is anticipated
      that this increased compliance with ACC guidelines and AUC may directly correlate with
      improved patient clinical outcomes.

        Group A patients will be identified by no established SIHD, but presenting with symptoms
        consistent with myocardial ischemia; Group B patients will be idenitified by Established
        SIHD and symptoms of myocardial ischemia. All patients will have: (1) Indications for
        functional stress testing. All functional stress tests will be designed to provoke cardiac
        ischemia by using exercise or pharmacological stress agents; (2) Multiple (&gt;3) cardiac risk
        factors including male gender, age &gt; 50 years old, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
        hyperlipidemia, nicotine exposure, and/or family history of cardiovascular disease.
