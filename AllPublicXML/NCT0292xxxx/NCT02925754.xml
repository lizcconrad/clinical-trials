    <textblock>
      Pain catastrophizing is conceptualized as a negative cognitive-affective response to
      anticipated or actual pain and has been associated with a number of important pain-related
      outcomes.

      The aims of this study are

        1. To describe the characteristics of the patients and determinants of catastrophizing in
           chronic painful patients hospitalized in rheumatology in the Nîmes University Hospital

        2. To describe the impact of the catastrophizing on the level of insomnia and the drugs
           consumption in chronic painful patients hospitalized in rheumatology in the Nîmes
           University Hospital
