  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a text messaging intervention using MyDiaText and to determine whether such an
      intervention will decrease HbA1c in children 12 to 18 years old. The intervention will
      consist of daily text messages sent to the subject's personal mobile device. Previously
      developed text messages based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) behavior goals will
      be used for this intervention. These will be adapted with input from the focus groups that
      will be carried out with adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The details of the
      intervention, such as frequency and timing of text messages, will be determined from input
      obtained from the focus groups.

    <measure>Change in Self-Care Inventory (SCI) score from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate of self-management will be assessed via the Self-Care Inventory questionnaire. The SCI is a 14-question, self-report measure of perceived adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations using a 5-point Likert scale that reflects how well they followed recommendations for self-care during the past month (1=&quot;never do it&quot; to 5 =&quot;always do this as recommended, without fail&quot;). Total scores range from 1-70 and previous data shows that youth with better self-care levels (higher scores) have significantly better glycemic control.</description>
