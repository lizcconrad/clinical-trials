    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, sequentially enrolling single arm phase II trial to
      evaluate the activity of TAS-102 in previously treated metastatic and locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer after progression through or intolerance to first line
      chemotherapy. Trial therapy will consist of TAS-102 (Lonsurf®) 35 mg/m2 to be given orally
      twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 with cycles repeating every 28 days. The primary endpoint is
      to determine the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with unresectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Clinically metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease as verified by
             radiographic imaging. Subjects without clear evidence of distant metastatic disease
             will be presented at multidisciplinary tumor board for discussion of disease
             resectability.

          -  Documented progression or intolerance to first line chemotherapy which was prescribed
             for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or locally advanced unresectable disease.
             Intolerance is defined as any sign or symptom from first line chemotherapy that
             resulted in stopping the treatment prematurely before progression of disease or the
             subject's desire to stop treatment without evidence of progression.

          -  TAS102 will be planned to start immediately after disease progression on first-line
             chemotherapy, provided any prior chemotherapy-related toxicities have resolved to less
             than or equal to Grade 1 or baseline within 28 days of the date the subject signs the
             informed consent form. Grade 2 or greater toxicities including alopecia, skin
             pigmentation,and platinum induced neurotoxicity/neuropathy are acceptable for starting
             on trial, as these toxicities do not preclude treatment with TAS102

        chemotherapy.

        Previous surgery and/or radiotherapy may have been performed up to 4 weeks prior to the
        date the subject signs the informed consent form, but there must be evidence of disease
        progression radiographically or intolerance to first-line chemotherapy.

        Patients on anticoagulation need to have no evidence of bleeding and be on a stable
        anticoagulation dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the date the subject signs the informed
        consent form.

             informed consent form, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy.
