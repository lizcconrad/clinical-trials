  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-confirmatory, randomized, subject and investigator blinded, placebo controlled
      study of QCC374 in PAH patients. The study will have 2 parts. In Part 1, an initial safety
      cohort, 8 subjects will be randomized in a 6:2 ratio and the starting dose will be 0.03 mg
      b.i.d.. In Part 2, ~ 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with a planned starting
      dose of 0.06 mg b.i.d.. In both Parts, subjects will be up-titrated during the first two
      weeks of the study to 0.12 mg b.i.d, or to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if their
      individual MTD is below 0.12 mg b.i.d. during the first two weeks of the study. The treatment
      duration is 16 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18 years of age or older with symptomatic PAH.

          -  Subjects with PAH belonging to one of the following subgroups of the Updated Clinical
             Classification Group 1 (Nice, 2013):

          -  Idiopathic PAH

          -  familial PAH

          -  PAH associated with connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease (surgically
             repaired at least 12 months prior to screening) or drug or toxin induced (for example,
             anorexigen use).

          -  Subjects must have persistent symptoms due to PAH despite therapy with at least one of
             the following PAH medications: an endothelin receptor antagonist, asoluble guanylate
             cyclase stimulator or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The subjects' PAH medication
             regimen, with typical medications including calcium channel blockers, endothelin
             receptor antagonists, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators and/or phosphodiesterase
             inhibitors, must have been used at a stable dose and frequency for at least 12 weeks
             before the screening visit and during the screening period.

          -  Diagnosis of PAH established according to the standard criteria before the screening
             visit:

          -  Resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 25 mmHg.

          -  PVR &gt; 240 dynes s/cm5.

          -  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt; 15
             mmHg

          -  PVR &gt; 400 dynes s/cm5 at the time of the baseline right heart catheterization (RHC)
             (if a RHC was completed within one month of the screening visit, that result may be
             used for inclusion).

          -  6-minute walk distance greater than 150 meters at Screening. This distance must be
             confirmed by a second 6MWT prior to randomization. The value of the second 6MWD should
             be within Â± 15% of the value obtained at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically unstable right heart failure within the last three months
             (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV).

          -  Subjects with PAH associated with portal hypertension, Human Immunodeficiency Virus
             (HIV) infection or unrepaired congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts

          -  Subjects who have received or have been scheduled to receive long-term treatment with
             epoprostenol or any prostacyclin within the three months prior to the screening visit
             or during the screening period.

          -  Hypotensive subjects (systemic systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg)

          -  Subjects with a history of left sided heart disease, chronic left sided heart failure,
             congenital or acquired valvular disease and/or pulmonary venous hypertension.

          -  Subjects with significant obstructive (forced expiratory volume in one second
             [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt; 70% predicted) or restrictive (total lung
             capacity &lt; 70% predicted) lung disease at screening.
