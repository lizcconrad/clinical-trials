    <textblock>
      Two groups of randomised rehabilitation patients will try a softwheels wheelchair and a
      regular one. One group will start with the softwheelsl and then change to the regular, and
      the other will start with the regular and then change to the softwheel.

      The patients who are received to the rehabilitation ward and are confined to the use of a
      wheelchair are randomized to two groups. The first are given a wheelchair with wheelsoft
      wheels and the second group with regular wheels. The wheels of the chair are all covered to
      look similar to regular wheels (the regular wheels are also covered). All the patients will
      be taken once a day to a 10 minute trip with the wheelchair. After two days a questionnaire
      regarding their experience with the chair will be passed. On the third day the groups will
      change their wheels to the other kind. And again taken to daily trips and a final
      questionnaire on day four. We will collect additional data from the patients: age, sex,
      medical record, weight, height, ethnic background, marital status, working status.
