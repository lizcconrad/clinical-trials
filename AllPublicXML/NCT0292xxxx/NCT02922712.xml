      Osteoarthritis is the most common disorders of the joints, which gives a page more than 10%
      of the world population aged over 45 years (Woolf A. D., Pfleger B., Bergman S., 2009). The
      main clinical manifestations of the disease are pain in the joints and a violation of their
      functions. Therefore, one of the first tasks in the therapeutic program, these patients will
      decrease and possible pain relief. Nesteroi dnye anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the
      main group of medicines drugs used in medical practice in lech th Research Institute of pain
      in patients with lesions of the musculoskeletal system. The basis of the therapeutic effect
      of the second of these drugs is the suppression of the activity of Fe p IU NTA cyclooxygenase
      (COX). Prichё m, the suppression of the activity of COX-2 isoenzyme involved in the synthesis
      of prostaglandins, induce the development of pain and PLAYBACK tion and provides
      anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs. B Blocking out of the enzyme COX-1, which controls the
      synthesis of prostaglandins, have cited a protective properties, leading to side effects of
      NSAIDs These so called nye formed the basis for the creation of new NSAIDs that can
      selectively inhibit COX-2 and m and mally affect COX. - 1.

      Nimesulide is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase -2 vnym with Sat and anced analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory effect, but also has antibradikinin, antihistamine and antioxidant
      activity of Stu(Nasonov EL, 1999, 2001).
