      This study was a pilot 3-month clinical trial that investigated the feasibility,
      effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health function of the Veterans Health
      Administration's patient health record for effecting a more positive physical activity (PA)
      and dietary intake lifestyle in a sample of 38 overweight and obese Veterans with
      prediabetes. Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main
      domains: objective (e.g., weight) and subjective (e.g., self-efficacy).

      This was a pilot clinical trial that used a single-group design to test the feasibility,
      effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health (TH) function of My HealtheVet,
      the VA's patient health record (PHR), as a tool for effecting a more positive physical
      activity (PA) and dietary intake lifestyle in overweight and obese Veterans with prediabetes.
      Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main domains:
      objective (PA as measured by an accelerometer, diet, weight, abdominal circumference, BMI,
      and blood pressure) and subjective (self-efficacy, intent to adhere to lifestyle change, and
      patient activation). Assessments, including screening on inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      physiological measurements, administration of questionnaires, and training on use of two
      critical features of the TH function--the use of Journals to enter dietary and PA data and
      the use of Vitals + Readings to enter weight and track physiological measures--took place
      place across four visits to the study site, which was the Veterans Administration Medical
      Center in Miami. The investigators hypothesized that this PHR-based intervention would
      demonstrate improvements and increases, respectively in the objective and subjective domain
      measures. The investigators also hypothesized that engagement by study participants with MHV
      would be demonstrated through meeting target criteria regarding making entries into this
      PHR's TH function, and that participants would be satisfied with the intervention.

    <description>The study intervention involved the provision to study participants of targeted instruction and practice on use of two features of the Track Health (TH) function of the VA's patient health record (PHR) known as My HealthyVet (MHV) -- Journals and Vitals + Readings -- as a basis for promoting positive physical activity (PA) and dietary lifestyles. Seven interactive multimedia instructional modules were developed by the study team. These modules demonstrated on a computer screen how to enter PA and diet information into the Journals feature; how to add weight data into the Vitals + Readings feature; how to view these and other measures in tabular and graphical formats over different time frames; and the concept of possible cause-effect links between behavioral lifestyle and physiological outcome data. Participants were directed to enter food intake, PA, and weight information a specified number of times per week over the 3-month study period.</description>
