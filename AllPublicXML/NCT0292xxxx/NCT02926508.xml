  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been an emerging interest in how manipulating gut microbiota (which is
      composed by microorganisms living in our digestive system) can influence learning, memory and
      cognition. This influence is thought to primarily occur via the gut endocrine and immune
      systems, and the vagus nerve, all of which influence brain function and are modulated by
      intestinal microorganisms. One way to manipulate the microbiota is to ingest dietary
      compounds, such as prebiotics.

      Prebiotics are non-digestible dietary fibres that enhance the growth of &quot;healthy&quot; bacteria in
      the intestines when given in adequate amounts. Prebiotics are relatively stable, can be
      stored at room temperature and can be easily added to foods or drinks. They are not degraded
      by enzymes and acids in the digestive tract; therefore they reach the colon relatively
      unchanged, where they are metabolised by specific bacteria, thus promoting their beneficial
      effects. Prebiotics can be found in very small proportions in vegetables and fruits such as
      leeks, onions, tomatoes, garlic, etc., but this naturally occurring quantity is generally
      insufficient to promote a significant growth of beneficial bacteria. Therefore, large
      quantities of purified prebiotics are available as powder supplements and sold in packages of
      the appropriate dose.

      Pre-clinical studies in animals have shown that prebiotics modulates brain expression of key
      molecules involved in cognition and brain health in rats. These findings therefore highlight
      the potential of influencing cognition through the manipulation of gut microbiota (in this
      case, via the ingestion of a prebiotic).

      Building on this evidence, the aim of this study is to investigate how manipulating gut
      microbiota can influence reading, learning and behaviour in a group of children whose reading
      scores suggest there is room for improvement.

      This study has a randomised, double-blind, between-subjects, placebo-controlled design,
      whereby participants will receive a 12-week treatment with Bimuno or a matched placebo.

      Children whose Key Stage 1 scores indicate they are within the lowest quintile for literacy,
      but whose teachers do not judge them to have any other significant learning difficulties,
      will be invited to be screened for the study. The teacher will also need to confirm if their
      reading is still a cause of concern; if not, the children will no longer be considered for
      inclusion in the study. Teachers will be asked to add the names of any additional children
      whose reading shows room for improvement. These children will be assessed to ensure they meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      If the child passes this initial school screening stage, and conditional to parental consent,
      he/she will then be assessed using the reading test from the British Ability Scale (BAS).
      Only those whose reading falls into the bottom 34th centile on the BAS word reading measure
      will be invited to take part in the full study.

      The study will include three sessions in total (all taking place at schools): (1) screening
      session, (2) baseline session and (3) post-intervention testing session. Children will also
      be asked to wear an actigraphy device for 5 consecutive nights before and after the
      treatment. In addition, children will be asked to give saliva samples on a few occasions
      (both at home - pre- and post-intervention -, as well as during the baseline and testing
      session visits).

      Parents and teachers will be asked to complete standardised questionnaires also before and
      after the treatment ends.

    <description>The active supplement of the food supplement (Bimuno) used in this study is called galacto‐oliogosaccharides (Bimuno®, BGOS). BGOS is a compound metabolised by specific bifidobacteria, which are beneficial bacteria, in our colon. Bimuno (2.3 calories) is composed by the following ingredients per gram of Bimuno: 0.96g dry matter; &lt;01g Fat; &lt;0.06g Protein; 0.821g GOS; 0.119g Lactose; 0.0331g Glucose and 0.0029g Galactose. Bimuno is tasteless.
Bimuno will be supplied in coded sachets (3.5g) for dispensing by parents. Each participant will be required to consume 1 sachet daily during breakfast, by mixing it with food or in a drink.</description>

    <description>Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide in powder form, which grows most bacteria in the gut, and not specifically the beneficial bifidobacteria.
The placebo will also be provided in daily coded sachets (3.5g) for dispensing by parents. Each participant will be required to consume 1 sachet daily during breakfast, by mixing it with food or in a drink.
This placebo has been used in previous studies, in which Bimuno was used as the active intervention. The placebo will be similar in taste and colour to the active intervention.</description>
