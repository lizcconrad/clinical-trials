  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) should consider control of postoperative
      pain and swelling, protection of the healing graft, restoration of full range of motion
      symmetric to the contralateral knee, strengthening of the muscles that stabilize the knee,
      hip, and trunk, enhancing neuromuscular control, and a gradual progression to functional
      activities that are required for return to the normal daily life. The effects of concomitant
      injuries and surgical procedures must also be considered in planning an individualized
      rehabilitation program. However, it is still unclear regarding the optimal exercise
      prescription after TKA. In the current study, the investigators plan to develop an exercise
      protocol and evaluate the result in a multidisciplinary approach, i.e. bone mineral density
      assessment. The exercise prescription consisted of cyclic exercise, aerobic exercise and
      resistant training exercise for first, second and third year, respectively. Cyclic exercise
      is advantaged safety and effectiveness of hydraulic resistance equipment, as well as the
      exercise can be quantitatively determined. Aerobic exercise is privileged by the
      cardiopulmonary endurance improvement, along with muscle strengthening in the associated
      muscle groups. Resistance exercise is specified for the indicated muscle groups, especially
      knee extensors, flexors, ankle plantar flexor and dorsi flexor in TKA reconstructed patients.
      The investigators hypothesis that using this cyclic exercise process can improve the body
      composition, muscle strength, bone mass density, level of oxidative damage indicators, gait
      performance, quality of life, knee joint range of motion, function of cardiopulmonary and
      fitness. This project will establish the scientific basis for rehabilitation protocol
      involving knee surgery.

    <measure>Change from baseline bone mineral density</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operation; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density measurement is measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Measurements are made over the lumbar spine and over the upper part of the hip and the measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline lower extremity muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operation; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity muscle strength, including extension and flexion of the hip, knee and ankle were tested by the HUMAC NORM system (CSMi, Stoughton, MA) with the eccentric/concentric contraction mode at an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s.Isokinetic tests were performed five times for each participant, and each test was separated by a rest period of 3 min. The participants are assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up and received verbal encouragement during the exertion of peak torque.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline SF-36 questionnaire assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operation; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. Eight sections including physical function, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to emotional problems, and mental health. Additionally, the eight health domains can be used to provide a physical component summary and mental component summary score. The outcome measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline KOOS questionnaire assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operation; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS contains 5 subscales with a total of 42 items: 1) pain, 2) other symptoms, 3) function in daily living (ADL), 4) function in sport and recreation and 5) knee-related quality of life. Each question receives a score from 0 to 4 and the scores are transformed to a 0-100 score (0, extreme symptoms, 100, no symptoms). The User's Guide, is available from www.koos.nu. The outcome measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>The 6-minutes' walk test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of 6 minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in 6 minutes and is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>
