  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of high-tech endoscopy in clinical
      practice.

      The important elements of this evaluation are:

        -  Evaluation of the character of neoplastic lesions in the colon based on different
           imaging techniques

        -  Verification of the endoscopic image with histopathologic descriptions

        -  Establishing the type of the lesion on the basis of Kudo and NICE classifications

        -  Comparison of the result of histopathological examination with the macroscopic type of
           the lesion

        -  Determination of the most advanced lesions (MAL)

        -  Comparison of the cecal intubation time

        -  Evaluation of the type of anesthesia used during colonoscopy

        -  Subjective assessment of the severity of pain according to VAS (visual analogue scale)

        -  Comparison of the accuracy of the location of lesions on the basis of endoscopic
           navigation

        -  Comparison of the total examination time

        -  Comparison of adenoma detection rate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 400 consecutive patients undergoing unsedated colonoscopy as a part of a national
      colorectal cancer screening program will be randomly assigned to innovative or conventional
      examination. Randomization will be based on computer-generated randomization lists. All
      patients will be blinded so they will not know which techniques will be used to assess
      lesions found in colon. In innovative colonoscopy group narrow band imaging (NBI) and Dual
      Focus (DF) function will be used to identify and classify all lesions according. to Kudo and
      NICE classification. Endoscopic biopsy samples will be taken from all lesions and in vivo
      endoscopic diagnosis will be compared with final histopathological result. Thus, sensitivity,
      specificity, diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, likelihood ratio and Youden index will
      be calculated. As secondary endpoints total examination time, cecal intubation rate and pain
      intensity (VAS) will be determined. This study will help to establish whether advanced
      imaging technologies used during colonoscopy may improve diagnostic possibilities and whether
      they prolong examination time or lead to increase of pain intensity afterwards.
