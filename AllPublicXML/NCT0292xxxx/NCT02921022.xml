  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called
      PEGPH20. PEGPH20 alone is considered investigational. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      has not approved the marketing or sale of PEGPH20, but have authorized its use in research
      studies with humans. PEGPH20 could shrink the cancer but it also can cause side effects.
      PEGPH20 is an enzyme that breaks down a specific tissue component called hyaluronan produced
      by some tumors. Pancreatic tumors often have a large amount of hyaluronan. The removal of
      hyaluronan from tumors may decrease tumor growth.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, written Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable (Stage III) or Stage IV PDAC.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) scan per RECIST v1.1.

          -  For patients with locally advanced disease, no previous radiotherapy, surgery,
             chemotherapy, or investigational therapy for the treatment of PDAC is permitted. For
             patients with metastatic disease, prior treatment for non-metastatic disease with 5-FU
             or gemictabine administered as radiation sensitizer, or as a cytotoxic therapy, in the
             adjuvant setting is allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion
             of the last dose and no ≥ Grade 2 treatment-related toxicities are present.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70%.

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  A negative serum pregnancy test, if female of reproductive potential.

          -  Screening clinical laboratory values as follows:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase ([AST]; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
                  [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase ([ALT]; serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase
                  [SGPT]) ≤2.5 times ULN, (if liver metastases are present, then ≤5 times ULN is
                  allowed).

               -  Serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min.

               -  Serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 cells/mm3.

             Effective contraceptive methods consist of prior sterilization, intra-uterine device,
             oral or injectable contraceptives, and/or barrier methods. Abstinence alone is not
             considered an adequate contraceptive measure for the purposes of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known central nervous system involvement or brain metastases.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease or myocardial infarction
             within the past 12 months.

          -  History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or clinical
             laboratory finding that leads to reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, that may affect the interpretation
             of the results, or that may render the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject
             unsuitable for the study.
