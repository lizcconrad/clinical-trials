  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction with healthcare is increasingly being utilized as a metric to reflect
      provider and hospital quality of care. Furthermore, at the core of a healthcare team and
      healthcare system is the desire to provide patients with the best possible care in order to
      achieve the best possible outcomes. Providers have the duty to identify areas of needed
      improvement within the domains of treatment. An area of need that is ubiquitous within
      medicine is pain control; in this case acute postoperative pain control is the targeted
      condition. Studies have already shown that better control of acute postoperative pain leads
      to shortened hospital stays, reduced hospital costs and patient morbidity, improved patient
      satisfaction and a reduced likelihood of developing chronic pain. Research within the field
      of pain management has definitively revealed that a combination of different medication
      regimens can control acute postoperative pain better than narcotics alone. In particular, the
      medication gabapentin has been shown to improve acute postop pain in many kinds of surgical
      settings, and it is a safe medication with arguably fewer side effects than narcotics. The
      investigators know that certain groups of post surgical otolaryngology patients can be at
      risk for high levels of postoperative pain. Given all of this information, physicians have a
      responsibility to utilize medications such as gabapentin to do a better job of controlling
      patient's pain. This investigation is a quality improvement project designed to elucidate the
      benefits of gabapentin in pain management in patients undergoing surgery of the head and neck
      mucosal surfaces. It will provide much needed data in an understudied population and
      ultimately will improve the practice of pain management, patient satisfaction and quality of
      care delivered in the Barnes otolaryngology department.
