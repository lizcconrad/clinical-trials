      Show by collecting sleep and activity data, outcomes after thoracic surgery are improved with
      better sleep and increased activity.

    <textblock>
      Little is known about how sleep deprivation affects recovery after thoracic surgery. There is
      some evidence that in cardiac surgery, sleep disturbance can lead to delayed recovery and
      mental status changes in the postoperative period. There are no similar reports of studies
      after thoracic surgery. We think that increased activity after surgery is beneficial for a
      rapid recovery and prevents blood clots, pneumonia and deconditioning. Without specific data
      this is difficult to prove.

    <description>A FitBit HR monitor will be placed on patients when they arrive on the nursing unit after thoracic surgery. Sleep and activity will be monitored for the duration of the patient's hospitalization and the data from the Fitbit HR device will be downloaded by the study staff to a computer.</description>
