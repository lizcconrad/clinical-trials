  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dose-painting may increase the chance of cure at minimised radiation-induced toxicity in
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for primary head and neck cancer. This could also
      apply for recurrent and second primary head and neck cancers in previously irradiated
      volumes. This trial (RIDPAINT) investigates the feasibility of FDG-PET guided radiotherapy
      using IMRT dose-painting by contours for patients with recurrent and second primary head and
      neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard re-irradiation regimen for head and neck cancer patients treated at the Oslo
      University Hospital is 1.5 Gy twice daily during 4 weeks with a total dose of 60 Gy.

      In this study the radiotherapy is planned using 18F-FDG PET/CT making one experimental
      &quot;dose-painting by contours&quot; SIB (simultaneous integrated boost) plan with a maximum point
      dose of 75 Gy. The participants will be given 65 Gy and 70 Gy minimum doses to two GTVs
      inside the conventional GTV (60 Gy). GTV_65Gy and GTV_70Gy are determined from the SUV values
      from the 18F-FDG PET/CT according to the formula proposed by the Ghent group (Van der
      Straeten et al, R&amp;O -06). It is expected to keep the level of normal tissue side-effects
      within or slightly above the level of conventional radiotherapy (i.e. maximum dose of 60 Gy).
      In addition to the routine follow-up, the participants will be examined with 18F-FDG PET/CT 6
      months after inclusion (4 1/2 months after end of radiotherapy) and HRQL measurements.
