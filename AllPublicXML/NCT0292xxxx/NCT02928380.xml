  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, an experimental denture adhesive with a precision tip nozzle was
      tested to evaluate the relative efficacy to reduce the ingress of food under the denture
      compared to use of no adhesive or a standard marketed adhesive.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the mass of food particle ingress when an adhesive is
      extruded through the new nozzle with directed application compared to the use of no adhesive
      and a marketed adhesive (extruded through a flat ribbon nozzle [FRN]) with standard
      application as per product label, utilizing a peanut occlusion methodology. This was a single
      center, controlled, single blind (to the examiner performing the safety assessments (oral
      soft tissue [OST] examination) and the laboratory staff weighing the peanut particles),
      randomized, three-treatment, three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper
      and lower dentures. Each treatment period consisted of one day of testing with at least two
      days between treatment visits. This study consisted four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit;
      Visit 2 - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.

    <measure>Combined Mass of Peanuts (Gram) (From Upper and Lower Dentures) for Reference Denture Adhesive and on no Adhesive Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with 30-32 g (accurately weighed) non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately four whole peanuts. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds. After completion of the peanut consumption, participants rinsed their mouth with water, participants may remove any residual peanut particles from their mouth with water and a gauze pad. Participants than removed their dentures. Peanut particles were collected from the fit surfaces of the dentures and the gauzes, and weighed to evaluate the mass of food particles that had migrated under the denture (keeping the particles associated with the upper and lower dentures separate).</description>

    <measure>Composite Kapur (Olshan Modification) Index Scores for Denture Retention and Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 days</time_frame>
    <description>Kapur (Olshan modification) Index score was assessed to examine each denture (upper &amp; lower) for retention &amp; stability. Retention was measured as score of 0-5 to assess nature of resistance offered by denture to vertical pull &amp; lateral force: 5=Excellent;4=Very Good;3=Good;2=Fair;1= Poor;0=No retention. Stability was measured as score of 0-4 to assess nature of rocking offered by denture base on its supporting structures under pressure:4=Excellent (no rocking);3=Good (very slight rocking);2=Fair (slight rocking);1=Poor (moderate rocking);0=No stability (extreme rocking). Composite Kapur (Olshan modification) Index scores was measured as the sum score of retention &amp; stability for upper or lower dentures separately such that a sum score of zero represents no retention and stability and a sum score of 9 represents excellent retention and stability.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 17 days</time_frame>
    <description>Kapur (Olshan modification) Index scores were assessed to examine each denture (upper &amp; lower) for its retention ability. Retention was measured as score of 0-5 to assess nature of resistance offered by denture to vertical pull &amp; lateral force: 5=Excellent - denture offered excellent resistance to vertical pull and lateral force; 4= Very Good- denture offered very good resistance to vertical pull and lateral force; 3= Good- denture offered moderate resistance to vertical pull and lateral force; 2= Fair- denture offered moderate resistance to vertical pull and little or no resistance to lateral forces; 1= Poor- denture offers slight resistance to vertical pull and little or no resistance to lateral force; 0= No retention- when the denture was seated in place, it displaced itself. Higher the score, higher the retention ability of denture.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 17 days</time_frame>
    <description>Kapur (Olshan modification) Index scores were assessed to examine each denture (upper &amp; lower) for its stability ability. Stability was measured using score of 0-4: 4= Excellent- when denture base offered no rocking on its supporting structures under pressure; 3= Good- when denture base had very slight rocking on its supporting structures under pressure; 2= Fair- when denture base had slight rocking on its supporting structures under pressure; 1= Poor- when denture base had moderate rocking on its supporting structures under pressure; 0= No stability- when denture base had extreme rocking under pressure. Higher the score, higher the stability ability of denture.</description>

        <description>Participants were provided with 30-32 g (accurately weighed) non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately four whole peanuts. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds. After completion of the peanut consumption, participants rinsed their mouth with water, participants may remove any residual peanut particles from their mouth with water and a gauze pad. Participants than removed their dentures. Peanut particles were collected from the fit surfaces of the dentures and the gauzes, and weighed to evaluate the mass of food particles that had migrated under the denture (keeping the particles associated with the upper and lower dentures separate).</description>

          <title>Combined Mass of Peanuts (Gram) (From Upper and Lower Dentures) for an Experimental Denture Adhesive and on no Adhesive Use</title>
          <description>Participants were provided with 30-32 g (accurately weighed) non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately four whole peanuts. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds. After completion of the peanut consumption, participants rinsed their mouth with water, participants may remove any residual peanut particles from their mouth with water and a gauze pad. Participants than removed their dentures. Peanut particles were collected from the fit surfaces of the dentures and the gauzes, and weighed to evaluate the mass of food particles that had migrated under the denture (keeping the particles associated with the upper and lower dentures separate).</description>

        <description>Kapur (Olshan modification) Index score was assessed to examine each denture (upper &amp; lower) for retention &amp; stability. Retention was measured as score of 0-5 to assess nature of resistance offered by denture to vertical pull &amp; lateral force: 5=Excellent;4=Very Good;3=Good;2=Fair;1= Poor;0=No retention. Stability was measured as score of 0-4 to assess nature of rocking offered by denture base on its supporting structures under pressure:4=Excellent (no rocking);3=Good (very slight rocking);2=Fair (slight rocking);1=Poor (moderate rocking);0=No stability (extreme rocking). Composite Kapur (Olshan modification) Index scores was measured as the sum score of retention &amp; stability for upper or lower dentures separately such that a sum score of zero represents no retention and stability and a sum score of 9 represents excellent retention and stability.</description>
