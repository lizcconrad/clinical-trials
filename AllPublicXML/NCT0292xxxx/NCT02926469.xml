  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of using immersive Virtual
      Reality (VR) during labor. We will also explore whether VR distraction is helpful for
      reducing subjective pain during labor, even if this pain is severe or excruciating. We
      predict that VR is feasible in this setting and that VR distraction will reduce acute pain
      and anxiety during labor.

      This study used an over the counter consumer product to create a virtual reality experience
      so that we could assess whether there was a decrease in perception of pain.
