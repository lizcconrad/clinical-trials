      This pilot clinical trial studies Hatha yoga in reducing physical and emotional problems in
      breast cancer survivors with stage II-III lymphedema. Yoga practices may benefit breast
      cancer survivors with lymphedema as they directly support lymph transport (postures,
      breathing, relaxation) and emotional well-being (relaxation, meditation).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of a modified yoga program for breast cancer survivors (BCS)
      with lymphedema.

      II. To identify and document required modifications for a safe and feasible practice.

      III. To obtain recruitment estimates and determine barriers to recruitment (acceptability).

      IV. To evaluate implementation fidelity (adherence and competence) and barriers to
      implementation fidelity.

      V. To establish safety. VI. To assess satisfaction. VII. To determine the preliminary
      efficacy of a modified yoga program for lymphedema in BCS, and associated physical and
      psychological symptoms/symptom burden, and overall health status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo an initial yoga evaluation for 60 minutes. Patients then undergo their first
      guided yoga practice session for 30-60 minutes and subsequent guided yoga sessions for 30-90
      minutes.

      3 times a week for 4 weeks, and twice a week for an additional 4 weeks. Patients are also
      encouraged to complete home yoga practice for 30 to 90 minutes every day for 8 weeks.
