  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in multiple cognitive skills after completing
      60 hours of cognitive training with ThinkRx, a LearningRx program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a two-phase randomized controlled study, investigators will examine the effects of a
      one-on-one cognitive training program on memory, visual and auditory processing, processing
      speed, reasoning, attention, and General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score for students ages
      8-14. In Phase 1, participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group to
      complete 60 hours of one-on-one cognitive training or to a wait-list control group. In Phase
      2, the wait-list control group will complete the intervention using an alternative delivery
      model: 50% clinician delivered and 50% digital delivery.
