    <textblock>
      Operable early stage breast cancer patients staged according to NCCN guidelines are subjected
      to bone marrow aspiration/trephine biopsy at the time of the definitive operation under
      general anesthesia. The specimen will be fixated in neutral tamponaded formalin and the
      sections will be examined by H&amp;E and cytokeratin immunohistochemically. If disseminated tumor
      cells are identified ER (estrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptor), HER2/neu will be
      studied. Disseminated tumor cells will be recorded quantitively and semiquantitatively.
      Results of the pilot study will be evaluated as observational study.
