  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to determine if 8 weeks of dietary augmentation with oral 5g
      creatine monohydrate daily and 100 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) twice daily reduces
      hypoxia-related depressive symptoms measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HAM-D) in women with SSRI- or SNRI-resistant depression, combined with the examination of
      changes in functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI and changes in brain
      metabolism inferred from phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin and creatine are processed separately in the brain, and deficits in these brain
      biochemicals lead to distinct clinical problems. Therefore, investigators believe that
      treatment with a combination therapy, which could correct both deficits, would have a
      synergistic effect in the treatment of hypoxia-related depression and possibly other forms of
      treatment-resistant depression. Thus, investigators propose to investigate antidepressant
      efficacy of dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and creatine, as a means to restore the brain
      neurotransmitter and metabolic imbalances linked to chronic hypoxia caused by high altitude
      residence.
