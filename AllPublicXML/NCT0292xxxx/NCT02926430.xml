    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study, is willing to
             participate in the study and attend all scheduled visits, and is willing and able to
             comply with all study procedures and adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol

          -  Before randomization, a woman must be: postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is
             defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause; and not
             intending to conceive by any methods

          -  From the time of first vaccination until 3 months after the first dose of study
             vaccine, and from the second vaccination through 3 months after, a man who has not had
             a vasectomy (or if a vasectomy was performed less than 1 year ago and the absence of
             sperm cannot be verified)

          -  In the investigator's clinical judgment, participant must be either in good or stable
             health. Participants may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension, type 2
             diabetes, hyperlipoproteinemia, or hypothyroidism, as long as their symptoms/signs are
             medically controlled. If they are on medication for a condition, the medication dose
             must have been stable for at least 12 weeks preceding vaccination and expected to
             remain stable for the duration of the study. Participants will be included on the
             basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening. If the results of the laboratory screening tests are outside the central
             laboratory normal reference ranges and additionally within the limits of toxicity
             Grades 1 or 2 according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicity tables
             (for tests in the FDA table ), the participant may be included only if the
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically
             significant and appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has acute illness (this does not include minor illnesses such as diarrhea)
             or temperature greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 38.0 degree celsius within 24 hours prior
             to the first dose of study vaccine; enrollment at a later date is permitted

          -  Participant has a serious chronic disorder, including severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease or clinically significant congestive heart failure, requirement for
             supplemental oxygen, end stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically
             unstable cardiac disease, Alzheimer's disease, or has any condition for which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the
             participant (for example, compromise well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or
             confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Participant has had major surgery within the 4 weeks prior to randomization or has
             planned major surgery through the course of the study

          -  Participant has chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, documented by
             hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, respectively

          -  Participant has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or type 2 infection
