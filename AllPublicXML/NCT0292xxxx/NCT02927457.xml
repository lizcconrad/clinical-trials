  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics
      and clinical effect of repeat dosing of GSK2646264 in patients with subacute and chronic
      cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) lesions and in acute CLE like lesions induced by
      photoprovocation (PV).

      Current study is two group study. In Group A, Patients with fewer than two active lesions
      will be enrolled and exposed to photoprovocation (PV) for 3 consecutive days. Patients that
      develop PV lesions at any time during this period, as determined by the local investigative
      team, will receive 1% strength GSK2646264 on 1 lesion and placebo on 1 lesion daily and
      either 1% strength GSK2646264 or placebo on an area of uninvolved skin, for skin
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of study drug, for 28 days.

      In Group B, Patients that have a minimum of 2 active existing CLE lesions as determined by
      the investigators will be enrolled into group B and have one lesion treated with 1%
      GSK2646264 and 1 lesion with placebo.

      A completed patient will be defined as a subject who receives at least 25 days of study drug
      and completes the end of treatment biopsy (at day 28) and assessment. Thereafter patients
      will be followed for 28 days in Group A only or until complete resolution of induced PV
      lesions, as determined by the investigator.
