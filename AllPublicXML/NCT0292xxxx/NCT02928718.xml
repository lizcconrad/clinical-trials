  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatitis remains the most common complication of ERCP, with the reported incidence
      ranging from 2% to 9%. Although 80% of cases are mild, a significant number of patients may
      develop severe pancreatitis, that means additional morbidity and risk for death. ERCP,
      despite the development of new diagnostic tools, remains a widely used procedure, so
      post-ERCP pancreatitis is a problem with significant impact. Several studies and
      meta-analyses helped us to recognize special factors that put an individual in high risk for
      the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Among these factors special interest presents the
      history of post-ERCP pancreatitis as an independent risk factor for a new episode of
      post-ERCP pancreatitis. It seems that some individuals have a genetically predisposed
      susceptibility in this particular complication. The aim of the present study is to
      investigate the possible genetic variation associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis using whole
      genome sequencing.

      This study includes patients who are at high risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Blood samples
      will be gathered to investigate the possible genetic variation associated with post-ERCP
      pancreatitis using whole genome sequencing. DNA for whole genome sequencing will be extracted
      using DNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Hinden, Germany) and the concentration &amp; purity of DNA
      will be measured using Nanodrop (Nano Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) or fluorometric
      quantitation(Qubit fluorometer). Genetic variations which are associated with acute
      pancreatitis will be searched using whole genome sequencing. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is the
      primary outcome. Medical records and data of genetic variations will be reviewed for
      identifying possible risk factors and genetic variations associated with post-ERCP
      pancreatitis.

    <description>Two expert endoscopists will perform ERCP. Patients will be sedated with midazolam(2-5mg) and pethidine(25-50mg) with careful monitoring. Duodenoscope (TJF-240 or TJF-260; Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) will be used. Cholangiography or pancreatography will be gathered after selective bile duct or pancreatic duct cannulation. Therapy such as endoscopic sphincterotomy, stent insertion, and etc., will be done.</description>
