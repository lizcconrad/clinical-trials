      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of decitabine when given
      together with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly diagnosed, has
      come back or has not responded to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine,
      cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, may increase
      the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of
      chemotherapy. Decitabine, filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic
      syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used concomitantly with
      filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride (G-CLAM) in patients with
      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      II. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the rate of complete remission without
      measurable residual disease (minimal residual disease negative [MRDneg] complete remission
      [CR]) with decitabine + G-CLAM at the MTD compared to similar patients treated previously
      with G-CLAM alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, disease response (complete remission,
      overall response rate) relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall
      survival (OS) in patients with newly-diagnosed AML / high-risk MDS.

      II. Describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of decitabine.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10. Patients
      also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days
      1-5, cytarabine IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-5, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 60
      minutes on days 1-3.

      RE-INDUCTION: Patients who do not achieve MRDneg CR after first induction are eligible for
      re-induction. Patients receive the same treatment as during induction except that decitabine
      is omitted.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 6 weeks after achieving MRDneg CR or CR/CR with incomplete
      count recovery (CRi) after induction and/or re-induction, patients are eligible to receive
      filgrastim, cladribine, and cytarabine as in Induction. Treatment may be repeated for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subsequent
      consolidation cycles would be given after recovery from the previous cycle (roughly 4-6
      weeks).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at for 1 month and every 3
      months for up to 5 years.

             (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= 45%, assessed within 3 months prior to

             failure; if the patient had anthracycline-based therapy since the most recent cardiac
             assessment, cardiac evaluation should be repeated if there is clinical or radiographic
             suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac assessment was abnormal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

          -  Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as defined
             as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24-48 hours

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any study drug
