        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female between the ages of 18 and 80 years.

          -  Have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, which
             has been refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 6 months.

          -  Be an appropriate candidate for an SCS trial and the surgical procedures required in
             this study based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator.

          -  Be willing and capable of giving informed consent and able to comply with
             study-related requirements, procedures, and visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a medical condition or pain in other area(s), not intended to be treated with
             SCS, that could interfere with study procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or
             confound evaluation of study endpoints, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other
             known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of
             intervention, and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcomes.

          -  Have an existing drug pump and/or SCS system or another active implantable device such
             as a pacemaker, deep brain stimulator (DBS), or sacral nerve stimulator (SNS).

          -  Have prior experience with SCS.

          -  Have an active systemic infection or local infection in the area of the surgical site.

          -  Be pregnant or nursing (if female and sexually active, subject must be using a
             reliable form of birth control, be surgically sterile, or be at least 2 years
             post-menopausal).

          -  Be concomitantly participating in another clinical study.
