  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is most diagnosed among women living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
      Many factors have been attributed to the incidence of vitamin D deficiency. Saudi women are
      thought to be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency because of their darker skin type and
      the likelihood of reduced ultraviolet exposure . The present study entitled, &quot;Dietary Intake
      and Vitamin D Level in adult Women,&quot; was formulated as there is paucity of data on the
      etiologic importance of dietary intake in Vitamin D level on blood on women. The major
      objective of the proposed study is to assess the effect of dietary intake of nutrients and
      level of vitamin D in women .

      For this study, the investigators enrolled 168 women 35-55 years old to evaluate Vitamin D
      status and to determined whether status was correlated with Vitamin D deficiency.

      All women completed a self-administered questionnaire about personal socio-demographic
      characteristics; They all had anthropometric measurements of body mass index and waist
      circumference. A 24-hour dietary recall was administered to all women.

      The proximate analysis of 25 types of food was conducted according to the American
      Association of Organic Chemists (AOAC) methods. The following parameters were measured: serum
      calcium. Vitamin D, levels of parathyroid hormone.
