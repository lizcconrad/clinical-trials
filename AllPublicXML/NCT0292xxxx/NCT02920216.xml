  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma often combines chemoradiotherapy when
      organ has to be preserved or when surgery is not indicated. The loco-regional failure is
      about 30%. Then salvage surgery is the only chance for patients to survive but the overall
      survival rate is only 29% at 24 months. This prognostic is bad because of poor local control
      which is non-optimized by a complementary radiotherapy and negative exeresis margins.

      Currently, there is no intraoperative technique to better visualize the tumor limits in real
      time. With fluorescence techniques, an accurate mapping of tumor extension can be considered.
      Recently, Atallah et al. (2015) demonstrated the use of fluorescence during a head and neck
      surgery in mice, as a tool allowing for better surgical margins. Digonnet et al (2015) found
      a tumor fragment after an injection of indocyanine green (ICG) intravenously in salvage
      surgery for patient with head and neck cancer.

      The ability of ICG to detect a surgical margin positive intraoperatively has never be
      evaluated in irradiated area.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the interest of fluorescence in salvage surgery
      for recurrence of head and neck cancer in irradiated area.
