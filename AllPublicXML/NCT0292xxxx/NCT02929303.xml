  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol for use of intravenous fish oil infusion, Omegaven, in
      infants and children with parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) to decrease
      elevated liver enzymes and direct bilirubin.

      This study aims to describe the response of PNALD after use of Omegaven by normalization of
      serum levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) is currently considered
      multifactorial. Available treatment options for this disease process are limited and have
      achieved moderate success at best. Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsions, Omegaven™
      is comprised solely of fish oils containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators
      hypothesize that administering Omegaven™ to patients with PNALD in place of conventional fat
      emulsion may reverse cholestasis allowing patients to be maintained on adequate PN until they
      are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.

    <description>Therapy is started at a dose of 1 gm/kg/day over 12 hrs. Omegaven may be infused via a central or peripheral IV. If additional fat calories are needed they will be provided by the enteral route.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pediatric patients aged 0 - 18 yrs

          2. Patients will be PN dependent (unable to meet nutritional needs solely by enteral
             nutrition). It will be assumed that patients will require parenteral nutrition for at
             least 30 days from the inclusion into the study.

          3. Patients must have parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) as defined as
             a direct bilirubin of 2mg/dl or more. Other causes of liver disease should be
             excluded. A liver biopsy is not necessary for treatment.

          4. 2 consecutive direct bilirubins &gt; 2.0 mg/dl. one week apart.

          5. Signed patient informed consent.

          6. The patient must have utilized standard therapies as clinically appropriate to prevent
             the progression of his/her liver disease. Such therapies could include surgical
             treatment, cyclic PN, avoiding overfeeding, reduction/removal of copper and manganese
             from PN, advancement of enteral feeding, and the use of ursodiol (i.e.,Actigall).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented cause of chronic liver disease other than parenteral nutrition associated
             liver disease.

          2. An allergy to any seafood product, egg protein, and/or previous allergy to Omegaven.

          3. Active coagulopathy characterized by ongoing bleeding or by a requirement for clotting
             factor replacement (e.g. fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) to maintain
             homeostasis.

          4. Impaired lipid metabolism or severe hyperlipidemia with or without pancreatitis.(e.g.
             (triglycerides &gt; 1000mg/dl while receiving intralipid 1g/kg/day or less)

          5. Unstable diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia (Blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dL) at the time of
             initiation of Omegaven

          6. Currently being treated for stroke, embolism, collapse and shock, myocardial
             infarction.

          7. Cholestasis due to any reason other than parenteral associated liver disease

          8. Active new infection at time of initiation of Omegaven

          9. Hemodynamic instability (e.g. receiving vasopressors) at time of initiation of
             Omegaven.

         10. The patient may not be enrolled in any other clinical trial involving an
             investigational agent (unless approved by the designated physicians on the
             multidisciplinary team).

         11. Known pregnancy.
