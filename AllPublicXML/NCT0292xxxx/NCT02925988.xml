    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, technical advances have improved the efficiency of continuous EEG
      recording and remote review, leading to a steep increase in the number of continuous EEGs
      performed, and to an emerging change in what is considered the standard of care with regards
      to brain monitoring. Critically ill patients are at high risk for CNS insults, which can
      result in permanent neurologic disability if untreated. Non-convulsive status epilepticus and
      other secondary brain injuries are often unrecognized without continuous EEG monitoring.
      There is increasing evidence that continuous EEG monitoring facilitates early identification
      and management of changes in brain function, and a recent consensus statement concludes that
      &quot;each center should provide critical care continuous EEG at the highest level that local
      resources allow&quot;. Neonatal neuro-intensive care is a rapidly developing field with a focus on
      monitoring of the developing brain. Without continuous EEG monitoring, neonates with
      paroxysmal events that are suspicious for seizures are treated with phenobarbital, often for
      many months, with inherent risks of side effects. Because paroxysmal events in neonates may
      or may not represent seizures, and electrographic seizures may have no discernable clinical
      correlate, this approach fails to adequately diagnose seizures and exposes neonates to
      possible harm, either by medication overuse for paroxysmal events that have no electrographic
      correlate, or by under-treatment of seizures without clinical manifestations.
      Amplitude-integrated EEG technology is now increasingly used as a simplified monitoring
      method, using fewer numbers of electrodes and usually being interpreted by a neonatologist or
      trainee. This model has been implemented at the investigators NICU. However, a recent
      systematic review came to the conclusion that amplitude-integrated EEG has relatively low and
      variable sensitivity and specificity, and therefore should not be the mainstay for diagnosis
      and management of neonatal seizures. Continuous video EEG monitoring is recommended as the
      gold standard for critically ill neonates, but is a very expensive and resource-intense
      method. An approach combining both techniques in a standardized algorithm may provide
      improved patient care in a resource-restricted environment. The investigators are planning to
      test this hypothesis in a pilot project.

      HYPOTHESIS

      An algorithm combining conventional and amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring will increase
      specificity and sensitivity of seizure detection in critically ill high-risk neonates in a
      resource-restricted environment.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. To describe the sensitivity and specificity of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) relative
           to conventional EEG (cEEG) monitoring in high-risk critically ill neonates

        2. To evaluate the feasibility of an algorithm combining amplitude-integrated and
           conventional EEG monitoring in high-risk critically ill neonates

      Long-term Objectives

      The proposed pilot research project will provide fundamental information essential for
      designing a future larger scale study analyzing a standardized algorithm of combined
      continuous EEG monitoring for high-risk critically ill neonates at the investigators NICU,
      with the ultimate goal of preventing secondary brain injury in these patients.

      Parents of potentially eligible patients will be approached by a study team member and will
      receive study information.

      Consent will be attained after sufficient time to review the consent form and to ask
      questions.

      This is a prospective study. We are aiming to enroll 20 neonates at high risk for seizures,
      consecutively.

      Monitoring

      Electrode positioning:

      The aEEG and the cEEG consist of 3 to 5 and of 8 to 14 electrodes respectively.

      Neonatal EEG application and set up will follow the international standard protocol in use at
      the investigators NICU.

      The electrodes will not be replaced unless there is a signal interruption. A local skin
      lesions might occur, in very rare cases, when prolonged EEG ( over 2-3 days).

      Monitoring protocol:

      Neonates will receive their amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring as soon as the indication for
      monitoring is established, and conventional EEG electrodes will be applied in parallel, as
      soon as an EEG technician is available, which should usually be within less than 16 hours, in
      many cases within 1-4 hours.

      Amplitude-integrated EEGs will be read and interpreted continuously, as currently standard of
      care at the investigators NICU. Conventional EEGs will be interpreted by a neurologist.
      During the review process, the neurology conventional EEG interpretation team will be blinded
      to the results of the amplitude-integrated EEG read by the neonatology team, and vice versa.

      Electrographic seizure events or other clinically relevant findings (e.g. abnormalities of
      background activity) will be communicated to the NICU staff (in accordance with current
      practice).

      EEG monitoring will be performed for as long as current NICU guidelines require.

      Measures captured will include:

        -  Time and duration of seizures as per clinical observation

        -  Time and duration of seizure as per amplitude integrated EEG

        -  Time and duration of seizure as per conventional EEG

        -  Time and duration of background activity abnormality as per amplitude integrated EEG

        -  Time and duration of background activity abnormality as per conventional EEG

        -  Other relevant findings on amplitude integrated EEG (e.g. localization-related)

        -  Other relevant findings on conventional EEG (e.g. localization-related)
