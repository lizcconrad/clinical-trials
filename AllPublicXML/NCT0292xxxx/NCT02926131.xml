  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study. The main purpose is to evaluate the stability of
      the Bilistick system in a humid and hot climate compared to the quantitative test for serum
      bilirubin (SBR) measurement currently used, the BR-501 total bilirubin meter, kept in a
      controlled environment.

      The secondary aim is to assess the operational feasibility of the Bilistick system in a
      tropical limited-resource setting, when used by locally trained nurses.

      Study procedure:

        1. SBR will be measured in parallel with two tests during three distinct seasons. (Cold,
           hot, rainy). The Blood is from an extra capillary sample taken from a single heel prick
           done for routine SBR) BR-501 total bilirubin meter, the quantitative test for SBR
           currently used, will be kept in a controlled environment while the new bilirubin test
           (Bilistick system) will be exposed to tropical conditions.

        2. Trained nurses will use the Bilistick system observed by a qualified laboratory
           technician; Usability of the Bilistick system by the trained nurses will be evaluated
           via a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire and focus groups discussions.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>5-point likert scale questionnaire will be filled individually by the trained nurses at the end of each defined season. Quantitative variables related to the secondary outcomes will be measured with the mean, median and ratio according to the distribution of the variable and compared with appropriated statistical test.</description>
