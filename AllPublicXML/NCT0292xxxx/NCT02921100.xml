  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      150 patients who had suspected pancreatic malignancy were planed to be enrolled in this
      study. Equal cytological samples of each patient undergoing EUS-FNA were examined by digital
      image analysis and conventional cytology respectively. The investigators aim to compare the
      efficacy of DIA and conventional cytology in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Further more, the
      investigators also collected the blood sample of each enrolled patient for advanced study.

      The conventional cytology was interpreted independently by two cytopathologists, both of whom
      are blinded to the DIA results. The conventional cytologic diagnosis were classified as no
      abnormal cells, atypical cells, suspicious malignant cells and malignant cells. The specimens
      were examined by two experienced cytopathologists. Any disagreement on specimens would refer
      to a third cytopathologist to provide a final consensus. The former two diagnosis were
      determined to be positive, and the latter two to be negative.

      DIA is a form of cytologic analysis that quantifies cellular constituents by using spectro
      photometric principles and a sister technique to flow cytometry. Computer analysis of the
      pixels produces a digital image of the nucleus and other cellular constituents.
      Quantification of DNA content, chromatin distribution, and nuclear morphology can be
      determined and suggest features of malignancy. ThinPrep specimens were prepared as previously
      described.Per specimen, the DNA content of at least 500 cells was selected for quantification
      using an image analyzer (Landing Medical High-tech, Wuhan, Hubei, China) and the mean
      integrated optical density lymphocytes served as an internal standard control. All other
      histograms suggesting the presence of (1) any cells with DNA&gt;5c; (2) diploidy cells with a
      very high proliferation rate where 10% or more of the total cells were found in the
      proliferation fraction; and (3) a population of aneuploidy stem cells, were called positive
      for malignancy. Images of cells reporting a DNA amount greater than 5c were examined
      microscopically by a cytotechnologist to exclude any artifacts such as dust, air bubbles,
      overlapping cells, etc. from the &gt;5c cell galleries.

      All the final diagnosis are to be confirmed by histopathology or a long term follow up.
