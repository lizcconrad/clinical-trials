  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint
      stimulation(TEAS) on postoperative recovery after colon surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, receiving 30min TEAS before anesthesia and 1,
      2 , 3 day after surgery respectively. The acupoints of TEAS group are bilateral Zusanli
      points(ST36) combined with Neiguan points(PC6), and the false stimulation group only attach
      electrodes without electric current. The frequency of TEAS is set to 2/10 Hz. After surgery,
      the time of meeting discharge criteria, first flatus and defecation were recorded. Score of
      PONV, life quality, sleep quality and VAS of pain were evaluated 24, 48 and 72h after
      surgery. The postoperative complications, re-exploration, cost of hospitalization and adverse
      events were also recorded.
