    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness in treating keratoconus, pellucid marginal
      degeneration and post LASIK iatrogenic ectasia utilizing fluence rates and treatment times of
      Corneal Cross Linking other than the original FDA approved protocol of 3mw/cm2.

      Patient recruitment will include a patient population of 100 individuals from 15 years to 50
      years old with established keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration or post-LASIK ectasia
      determined by keratography. A solution of transepithelial riboflavin .25% will be applied
      every three minutes for 30 minutes or until complete corneal penetration is observed. Then
      the cornea will be irradiated with UV light at fluence rates of 9mw/cm2 for 10 minutes or 18
      mw/cm2 for 5 minutes. Post procedural evaluation will take place at day one, day 7 day 30,
      day 90, day 180 and day 365. Pretreatment keratography, uncorrected acuity, best corrected
      acuity will be compared at follow up days beginning on day 30.
