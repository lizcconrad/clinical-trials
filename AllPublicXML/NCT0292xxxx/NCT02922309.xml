  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People over 55 years are high-risk with voice disorders. Voice disordered elderly need vocal
      training in order to improve communication efficiency and quality of life. However,
      participation in vocal training of elderly is often restricted by motivation, time of
      practice, and availability to hospital, which thus reduces treatment effects. The purpose of
      the study is to design a telecommunication vocal training system and a vocal training program
      for voice disordered elderly in Taiwan. The investigator proposed a 3-year consecutive study,
      including a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, to test the hypothesis that vocal
      training via telepractice for voice disordered elderly are not inferior to the standard face
      to face training.

      Randomization: per mutated block, 40 patients on each arms (experimental and control)

      Allocation: sealed envelope indicating either of the 2 groups

      Intervention: weekly vocal training, each course last for 30-40 minutes,lasting for 2 months

      Outcome measurement: before treatment, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment

      Primary outcome: 10-item voice handicap index

      Secondary outcome: acoustics and aerodynamic parameter
