  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, potential associations between several genetic polymorphisms and nicotine
      dependence will be examined. The relative reinforcing efficacy of cigarettes using the
      forced-choice procedure will be assessed. In addition, reactivity to smoking cues using a
      reliable procedure will be conducted.

      It is known that cannabinoid and dopamine receptors can be important modulators of response
      to nicotine and its associated cues. In this study participants will be genotyped to
      determine whether there is a relationship between CB1 or D3 genes and the reinforcing
      properties of nicotine or the subjective effects of nicotine-associated cues. In one session,
      participants will chose between two different cigarettes, each with different properties. In
      another session, physiological responses and craving will be measured when presented with
      cues that remind participants of nicotine. At some point during the study, blood will be
      collected for genotyping and this will processed to study whether CB1 or D3 genotype
      influences these responses to nicotine or cues.
