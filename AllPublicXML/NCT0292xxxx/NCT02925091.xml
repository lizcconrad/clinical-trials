  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infects ~ 50% of the world's population and a quarter of the European
      population. H. pylori is responsible for a large proportion of gastric and duodenal ulcers
      and gastritis. Chronic infection with H. pylori is a risk factor for the development of
      stomach cancer and MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) Lymphoma. The prospects of
      success for an antimicrobial eradication therapy is drastically reduced by the significant
      increase in antibiotic resistance in Austrian H. pylori isolates. The currently available
      data were obtained however from narrowly defined geographical regions and the clinical
      routine without information on patient selection. We suspect a considerable geographical
      variability of resistance patterns and a clinical bias for a preferential investigation of
      patients with unsuccessful, empirical eradication therapy. The objective of the proposed
      study is therefore an Austria-wide collection of data on H. pylori resistance in a
      prospective clinical study. The data thus collected will enable a significant improvement in
      current treatment recommendations.
