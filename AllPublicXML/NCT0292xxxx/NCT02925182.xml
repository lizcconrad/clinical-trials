      The aim this study was to investigate the efficacy of Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation in
      reducing pain and on healing rate of recurrent aphthous stomatitis 40 patients with RAS were
      included to the study. For each patient, ulceration were randomly assigned to the test or the
      control group. In test group RAS irradiated with Er,Cr:YSGG laser using non-contact mode. In
      the placebo group, the same Er,Cr:YSGG laser without laser emission was used. Pain was
      evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS). Healing of RAS (HRAS) was graded by a clinician.

    <description>Patients were asked to record their pain and discomfort level for each stomatit by marking a point on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The healing of recurrent aphthous (HRAS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The healing of RAS (HRAS) were evaluated:at the follow-up sessions by the investigator on a four-point scale (range 1-4). Grade 1 represented totally healing, grade 2 moderate healing (more than 50% of RAS was epithelialized and healed), grade 3 slightly healing (less than 50% of RAS was epithelialized and healed) and grade 4 no healing.</description>

    <description>Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis were irradiated with Er,Cr:YSGG laser (Waterlase MD, Biolase, Irvine, CA, USA) on hard tissue mode with a mg6 sapphire tip (600 µm diameter, 6 mm length) using non-contact mode at an energy level of 0.25W and a repetition rate of 20 kHz and pulse duration of 140 µs, 0% water and 10% air at 5 J/cm2 energy density. The treatment time was 20 s per surface by scanning the Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis area.</description>
