      This study evaluates the role of histidine in patients with HARS Syndrome. Children with HARS
      Syndrome will receive oral nutritional supplementation with histidine at a dose which will be
      increased in the event of acute febrile illness. Vision, hearing and plasma biomarkers will
      be monitored throughout the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HARS syndrome is a progressive degenerative disease affecting eyesight and hearing caused by
      a mutation in the HARS gene which codes for an enzyme involved in protein synthesis. HARS
      syndrome has been exclusively found in the Old Order Amish communities in Southwestern
      Ontario and in Pennsylvania. Children with this disorder initially have normal vision and
      hearing, but with a febrile illness, can have a sudden loss of vision and hearing, as well as
      visual hallucinations. There is some evidence that vision loss progresses, albeit at a slower
      rate, even without a febrile incident. In more severe cases, fluid accumulates in the lungs
      (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) which can cause a drop in oxygen levels and
      sometimes death. There is currently no specific treatment for HARS syndrome, apart from
      supportive care. Anecdotal evidence of an adult with HARS syndrome who was treated with the
      amino acid L-histidine suggests that there was an improvement in vision, however there were
      no baseline objective measurements of vision prior to the use of histidine. We have designed
      a pilot project in which histidine will be given to children with HARS for 6 months.
      Investigators hypothesize that the histidine will be well tolerated and easily administered,
      without side effects. Investigators will monitor vision, hearing and bloodwork to determine
      if there is any change during the course of treatment. As well, investigators plan to
      administer increased doses of histidine during acute illnesses, hoping to prevent
      deterioration in breathing due to ARDS. The results of this initial pilot project may pave
      the way for a longer term study of the use of histidine.
