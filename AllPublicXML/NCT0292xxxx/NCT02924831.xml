  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To study the relationship between Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and heart rate (HR) and
           its variability (HRV).

        2. To compare the curative effects and the HR/HRV indices between applicationa of different
           acupoints as well as different treatments (acupuncture and moxibustion).
