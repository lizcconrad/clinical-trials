    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Panhematin is safe and effective for prevention
      of acute attacks of porphyria.

      The study aims to provide high quality evidence for the use on hemin for prevention of acute
      attacks of porphyria. A separate study is in progress to evaluate the use of Panhematin for
      treatment of acute attacks of porphyria. Such studies have not been done previously for
      treating or preventing acute attacks with hemin. The lack of strong evidence for efficacy of
      hemin for treatment and prevention of attacks limits its availability for patients with acute
      porphyrias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial investigating
      the efficacy and safety of Panhematin™ for preventing acute attacks in at least 20 patients
      with well-documented acute porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria
      or variegate porphyria). These patients will (1.) have had frequent attacks in the past, with
      symptoms such as abdominal, back and/or limb pain and diagnosed after exclusion of other
      causes, and (2.) be on hemin prophylaxis for prevention of frequent attacks. It is expected
      that patients will have had 6 or more attacks in one year before starting hemin prophylaxis.
      This would be considered justification for a preventive regimen of hemin on clinical grounds.
      A single double blind dose of Panhematin™ or placebo will be given. An interim analysis will
      be carried out after completion of 10 patients to assess progress and possibly adjust the
      sample size. The trial consists of the following:

        -  A screening visit to determine eligibility and obtain informed consent

        -  A treatment visit for administration of a double blind prophylactic dose of Panhematin™
           or placebo

        -  Follow up visit at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks to assess response to the infusion of
           Panhematin™ or placebo. These visits will be in person or by telephone.

        -  Additional visits may be scheduled if needed, for example for treatment of symptoms.

        -  Follow-up visits 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment either in person or by
           telephone Patients will have laboratory documentation of one of the acute porphyrias.
           Molecular documentation is also expected, although rarely a causative mutation cannot be
           detected. Upon entry into the study they will be given in a blinded fashion a single
           preventive dose of either Panhematin™ (4 mg/kg) or placebo. A recurrent attack within
           the next 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks will represent treatment failures. Because at study entry
           most patients are expected to be on weekly prophylactic hemin treatment, and hemin is a
           short-acting drug, emphasis in the analysis will be on attacks occurring within 1 week
           after study treatment.

      Any attacks that occur during the study will be treated according to standard of care, which
      may include Panhematin™, either at the study site or at the patient's usual treatment
      location.

      It is intended that 20 patients will complete treatment with a single blinded dose and at
      least 4 weeks of follow up. A completed patient is one who meets all entrance criteria, has
      no exclusion criteria and completes the single dosing and at least one week of follow up, or
      is withdrawn because of an adverse event.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged 18 years

          2. Willing to provide written informed consent

          3. A diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria or variegate
             porphyria confirmed by the following criteria, which are based on the criteria for
             enrollment in the Longitudinal Study of the Porphyrias Consortium. For each type of
             porphyria, the inclusion criteria are based on 1) clinical features, 2) biochemical
             findings, as documented by laboratory reports (or copies) of porphyria-specific
             testing, and 3) molecular studies to identify a mutation in a porphyria-related gene.
             Equivocal biochemical measurements may require confirmatory testing. Testing for a
             disease-causing mutation must be attempted, but an identified mutation is not
             essential for enrollment, since it is known that a mutation cannot be found in a small
             fraction (&lt;5%) of biochemically proven cases of porphyria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptoms such as abdominal, back or limb pain are explained by another condition, as
             judged by the investigator

          2. Known or suspected allergy to Panhematin™ or related products

          3. A known or suspected allergy to human albumin

          4. Any disease or condition that the investigator judges would lead to an unacceptable
             risk to the patient or interfere with the successful collection of data for the trial

          5. Previous randomization in this trial
