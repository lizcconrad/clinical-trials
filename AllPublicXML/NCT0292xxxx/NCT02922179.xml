  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 40 years, new types of insulins have been marketed to mirror the effect of
      endogenous insulin. With the existing long-acting insulin product patents expiring and the
      FDA approval of new biosimilar and innovator insulins, adults with diabetes and their
      physicians will have additional therapeutic options. This observational study will describe
      the patient characteristics of new and existing users of long-acting or intermediate acting
      insulins with and without oral anti-diabetic agents (OAD) as well as acute hypoglycemic
      episodes, acute cardiac events, and A1C measures. The Biologic and Biosimilars Collective
      Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) will use the findings from this descriptive analysis to
      design a comparative study evaluating the real-world effectiveness and safety of biosimilar
      and innovator insulins.

      Additional information:

      This protocol was designed as a descriptive analysis, not to support a hypothesis. This
      information is being provided to the public in the interest of transparency and for
      demonstrating the BBCIC's Distributed Research Network's (DRN) ability to define exposures,
      outcomes, covariates and confounders. When published, the report will caution that the
      protocol does not support any ability to compare safety or effectiveness but instead is to be
      used only to explore the feasibility of future, more detailed comparative analyses and to
      better understand the capabilities of the BBCIC project. Further, the report will caution
      that information from this protocol should not affect use of the medical products described
      in any way and the fact that the BBCIC is performing this descriptive analysis in no way
      suggests there is a safety or effectiveness issue with any of the products described.
