    <textblock>
      The aim of this research was to evaluate the lingual tonsil hypertrophy (LTH) grading of
      patients with dysphagia using videolaryngoscopy and determine the relation of LTH grades to
      sociodemographic factors and clinical symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Two groups of people were interviewed during this research - the LTH group and the control
      group - a total of 100 subjects. The first group was comprised of 50 individuals, who visited
      the otorhinolaryngologist at Lithuanian University of Health Sciences hospital, regarding
      dysphagia, and were diagnosed with LTH during endoscopy. The second group consisted of 50
      healthy individuals without dysphagia, who did not have enlarged lingual tonsils during
      assessment using videolaryngoscopy. All subjects filled out the questionnaires, composed of
      RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and DSQ (Dysphagia Screening Questionnaire) questionnaires,
      validated and verified for use in Lithuania, together with a questionnaire created
      specifically for this research for gathering sociodemographic data.

      The LTH grade of all subjects was determined using DelGaudio and Friedman grading systems.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lingual tonsil enlargement grade on videolaryngoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Lingual tonsil enlargement grade was assessed using DelGaudio (2008) and Friedman (2015) grading systems during videolaryngoscopy.
According DelGaudio severity of LTH was assessed as: grade 0- lingual tonsils are not enlarged; 1- the lingual tonsils are prominent but not in full contact with the epiglottis or obscuring the valleculae; 2- the lingual tonsils obscure the view of the valleculae and are fully in contact with the epiglottis; 3- the lingual tonsils fill the valleculae and partially or fully obscure the view of the epiglottis.
Friedman grading system consists of 0 to 4 scale: 0- complete absence of lymphoid tissue; 1- lymphoid tissue scattered over tongue base; 2- lymphoid tissue covering entirety of tongue base with limited vertical thickness; 3- significantly raised lymphoid tissue covering entirety of the tongue base, approximately 5 to 10 mm in thickness; 4- lymphoid tissue rising above the tip of the epiglottis, 10 or more mm in thickness.</description>
