             reaction during the placebo challenge

          -  Positive peanut allergy skin prick test &gt;3 mm of the negative control and detectable
             serum peanut-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels by ImmunoCAP testing.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 36 kg/m2 (inclusive) and total body weight &gt;50 kg (110
             lb). BMI = weight (kg)/(height [m2]).

          -  Willing and able to comply with the study protocol requirements.

             screening and Day 1, and be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the study and for 15 weeks after the last administration of
             investigational product. Postmenopausal patients defined as (1) aged over 45 years
             with at least 1 year of amenorrhea and levels of follicle stimulating hormone over 20
             IU/L or (2) aged over 50 years with at least 1 year of amenorrhea.

          -  Male patients must be willing to use effective methods of contraception during the

             product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have concomitant dermatological or medical condition(s) which may interfere with the
             Investigator's ability to evaluate the patient's response to the investigational
             product.

          -  Have experienced severe life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to peanuts within 6
             months before screening (i.e., requiring an intensive care unit (ICU) admission).

          -  Positive clinical reaction observed during the placebo oral food challenge.

          -  Participation in any interventional study for the treatment of peanut and/or food
             allergies in the 12 months before screening.

          -  Have received any investigational product or been part of any interventional clinical
             study within a period of 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before

          -  Have received systemic corticosteroids, nonsteroidal, immunosuppressant, or
             immunomodulating drugs treatments within 2 weeks before screening.

          -  Use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor
             blockers, or calcium channel blockers within 2 weeks before screening.

          -  History of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

          -  Use of biologics within 6 months before screening or subject is in build-up phase of
             allergen immunotherapy (excluding peanut) and has not reached maintenance dose.

          -  Have received antibiotic treatment within 1 week before screening.

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions following infusions of human
             blood or blood components.

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions a component of ANB020
             formulation or the inactive ingredients (excipients).

          -  If female, are pregnant or lactating, or intend to become pregnant during the study
             period.

          -  Current diagnosis of asthma requiring Global Initiative for Asthma Assessment (GINA)
             Step 4 or higher treatment or asthma partially controlled or uncontrolled according to
             GINA classifications in the last three months before screening.

          -  History of a life threatening asthma attack within 1 year before screening (example:
             requiring an intensive care unit admission, intubation with mechanical ventilation).

          -  Other significant medical conditions that in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, prevent participation in the study.

          -  History of drug, alcohol or other substance abuse, or other factors limiting the
             ability to cooperate and to comply with the study protocol.

          -  Have any other physical, mental, or medical conditions which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make study participation inadvisable or could confound study
             assessments.
