    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access study to assess the safety profile and changes in serum direct
      bilirubin levels in infants with PN associated cholestasis. Eligible patients will receive
      therapy with Omegaven on an expanded access basis by method of continuous infusion. Omegaven
      will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter in conjunction
      with parenteral nutrition. The same standards of care provided to all patients receiving
      parenteral nutrition solution will be followed.

    <textblock>
      This expanded access protocol provides a mechanism for critically ill infants with parenteral
      nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) to receive Omegaven for compassionate use
      situations for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments.

    <intervention_name>Omegaven</intervention_name>
    <description>Therapy with Omegaven will be provided at a dose of 1 gm/kg/day infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter in conjunction with parenteral nutrition. Parenteral fat emulsion (Intralipid) will be administered only if necessary to administer adequate calories during Omegaven therapy. The same standards of care provided to all patients receiving parenteral nutrition solution will be followed.
Home Use of Omegaven:
The Omegaven dose for home use will be the same as that used while in the hospital: 1 gm/kg/day. As with the inpatient part of the protocol, this is a maximum dose and may be decreased at the discretion of the provider.</description>

          -  Greater than 4 weeks (28 days) old and less then 5 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of PNALD as defined by serum direct bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL on 2
             consecutive occasions

          -  Expected to require intravenous nutrition for at least an additional 28 days

          -  Have been PN-dependent for at least four weeks prior to planned Omegaven initiation

          -  PN-dependent and unable to meet nutritional requirements by enteral means

          -  Have failed standard therapies to prevent progression of PNALD

          -  Hospitalized at time of Omegaven initiation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a congenitally lethal condition (e.g. Trisomy 13).

          -  Have evidence of a viral hepatitis or primary liver disease as the primary etiology of
             their cholestasis.

          -  Have other health problems such that survival is extremely unlikely even if the
             infant's cholestasis improves.

          -  Have been in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrollment or received an
             investigational drug within 30 days prior to enrollment or scheduled to receive an
             investigational drug other than Omegaven during the study period.

          -  Severe and/or unstable concomitant systemic disease such as complex congenital cardiac
             disease, renal failure, autoimmune disease, sepsis, inborn error of metabolism,
             genetic liver disease

          -  Bleeding disorder

          -  Biochemical disturbance with potential of worsening with proposed treatment, e.g.
             persistent hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia.
