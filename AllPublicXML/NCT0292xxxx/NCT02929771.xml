  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of virtual reality (VR) in decreasing procedural pain
      related to subcutaneous port (SCP) access in children with cancer. The study is a
      pilot-randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a cross-over design that will provide us with
      detailed information on the feasibility of implementing our trial protocol in a future
      multi-center RCT as well as preliminary estimate of VR treatment effect on children with
      cancer undergoing SCP access, including child and parent factors potentially associated with
      VR distraction treatment efficacy.

      The study is a repeated-measures cross-over pilot RCT to examine the feasibility of the trial
      protocol for a study into the effectiveness of immersive VR in minimizing procedural pain and
      distress in children with cancer. The research objectives are to: (1) pilot implementing
      immersive virtual reality (VR) for effectiveness testing in a future RCT (measured as
      implementation outcomes); (2) determine treatment effect sizes (measured as preliminary
      effectiveness outcomes), between VR, programmed to distract children during an SCP needle
      insertion, and an active control intervention (i.e., watching a video with headphones); and
      (3) assess impact of child and parent factors potentially associated with VR treatment
      effectiveness. Both the intervention and control groups will receive standard medical care
      (e.g., topical anesthetics). A convenience sample of 40 children and adolescents with cancer
      (20 participants per treatment arm; 10 boys and 10 girls per treatment arm) will be
      recruited. In addition, each child will act as their own control. A washout period of 1 month
      will be used to control for any carry-over effect between conditions. In addition to usual
      care, children in the experimental condition will wear the VR headset plus headphones. In the
      control condition, children will watch a video (i.e., an age-appropriate video selected by an
      oncology-affiliated child life specialist) on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones as
      in the experimental condition. Implementation outcomes include accrual and retention rates,
      acceptability and technical difficulties. Effectiveness outcomes include child pain,
      distress, and fear, as well as parent distress.

    <description>In addition to usual care, the intervention group will receive the Samsung GearVR with head mounted display (HMD), controller, and headphones. They will situated in front of the nurse and beside/on the lap of the parent, or they may be lying supine. The VR intervention will use auditory and visual stimuli (simulating the peaceful underwater environment) to distract the child before, during, and after the SCP needle insertion. Children will be allowed to 'try-out' the VR system before the SCP access to familiarize themselves with the equipment. The entire study will be videotaped.</description>

    <description>In addition to usual care, participants in the control group will be seated with their parent and in front of the nurse, according to preference. Children will watch an age appropriate video selected by an oncology-affiliated child life specialist on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones used in the experimental condition. The RA will hold the iPad and positioned within a meter of the child so that the child can still see the iPad without the RA interfering in the clinical procedure. The entire study will be videotaped.</description>
