  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), an inhibitor of factor IIa (dabigatran) or factor Xa
      inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) are an alternative to treatment with warfarin in patients
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) non-valvular .

      These molecules have demonstrated non-inferiority compared to warfarin standard treatment for
      the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with non-valvular AF at high risk
      thomboembolique (Score CHA2DS2-VASc ≥1). These molecules have a constant biological
      effectiveness does not require laboratory monitoring in clinical practice, unlike AVK whose
      use requires, because of their variability action intra- and inter-individual, a constant
      dose adjustment based on 'Nationalized Index Ratio (INR).

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the interest of specific dosage of anti-activated
      factor X activity (Xa) in the identification of non-observing treating patients with Factor
      Xa inhibitor in patients with non-FA valvular

      Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), either factor IIa inhibitor (dabigatran) or factor Xa
      inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonist in patients
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) . These drugs have demonstrated their
      non-inferiority, compared to warfarin, for the prevention of thromboembolic events in high
      risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥1) non-valvular AF patients . These medications have predictable
      pharmacological effects and limited drugs and foods interactions which relieve from the need
      of routine anticoagulation monitoring compared to warfarin.

      One of the limitations of these drugs is their short half-lives (about 12 hours for all three
      drugs) . Thus, a single missed dose of DOACs regimen may result in suboptimal
      anticoagulation. Adequate adherence to DOACs is essential to achieve effective levels of
      anticoagulation. It has been reported that up to 28% of patients treated with dabigatan for
      AF had poor adherence (proportion of days covered &lt;80%). In a recent study including 500 AF
      patients, 43% and 44% of them, respectively treated with VKA and DOACs, self-reported non
      adherence to their anticoagulation treatment . Lower adherence is associated with a greater
      risk for combined all-cause mortality and stroke in AF patients .

      The aim of this study is to evaluate a specific dosage of anticoagulation level to detect non
      adherence to oral anticoagulant treatment in AF patients treated with anti factor Xa
      inhibitor.

      One hundred and fifty consecutive AF patients treated with either rivaroxaban 20 mg or 15 mg
      once daily or apixaban 5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily and not meeting exclusion criteria will be
      included in this study.

      Planned and unplanned admissions. Patients will have to be under ACODs regimen for at least
      30 days before inclusion.

      Informed consent will be given. Blood sample with specific anti factor Xa activity dosage
      will be performed. Thereafter, adherence to oral anticoagulant treatment will be evaluated
      using the Morisky medication adherence scale . This 8-item patient self report scale has been
      previously validated for cardiovascular treatment adherence.

      Primary endpoint will be the prevalence of medication nonadherence based on anti factor Xa
      activity below therapeutic level at time of admission and a self-reported questionnaire (the
      Morisky medication adherence scale).

      Secondary endpoints will be determination of prevalence of medication nonadherence based on
      self-reported questionnaire (the Morisky medication adherence scale), determination of
      predictive factors of medication nonadherence in the population studied and to compare the
      prevalence of medication nonadherence based on anti factor Xa dosing to the Morisky
      medication adherence scale.

    <description>Rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations will be determined using the Biophen Heparin LRT anti-Xa assay (Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). This assay is a chromogenic assay for in vitro quantitative measurement of indirect or direct Factor Xa inhibitors.
All analyses will be performed on the STA-R Evolution Analyzer (Stago, Asnières sur Seine, France).</description>

    <description>The Morisky medication adherence scale will be used to evaluate anti factor Xa inhibitor treatment adherence during the last month. This scale is an 8-item patient self-report that has been previously validated for cardiovascular treatment adherence [10]. Response categories are yes/no for each item with a dichotomous response and a 5-point Likert response for the last item. Three levels of adherence are identified: high adherence (score, 8), medium adherence (score, 6 to &lt;8), and low adherence (score, &lt;6).</description>
