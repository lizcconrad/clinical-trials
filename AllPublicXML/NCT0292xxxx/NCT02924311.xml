      The main objectives of this observational study are to describe outcomes, monitoring and
      treatment patterns of patients with diabetic macular edema in routine clinical practice who
      are either treatment naïve patients or previously treated patients. The total study
      population will be evaluated as well as the two subgroups (previously treated patients and
      treatment naïve patients).

      This study is designated to answer French Health Authority (HAS Haute Autorité de Santé)
      requirements.
