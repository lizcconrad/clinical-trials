      Background:

      More effective treatments for people with cocaine use disorder are needed. Researchers want
      to understand the parts of the brain involved in the disorder. Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) stimulates parts of the brain. A form of TMS called intermittent
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) may help reduce cocaine use. Researchers want to learn how the
      brain might change with treatment.

      Objectives:

      To test if iTBS can reduce cocaine use. Also, to learn how cocaine changes the heart and the
      brain.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-60 who do or do not have cocaine use disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Alcohol breath tests

      In the pilot study, 10 participants with cocaine use disorder will have 10 treatment days
      over 2 weeks. Half will be inpatient and half will be outpatient. They will have 2 follow-up
      visits. Treatment includes:

        -  iTBS: A coil is placed on the head. A brief electrical current passes through the coil.
           They view cocaine-related images during each session. Sessions are videotaped.

        -  Repeat of screening tests

             -  In the main study, participants will be randomly assigned to have either real or
                fake iTBS.

             -  Participants with cocaine use disorder will join an incentive program to quit.

             -  Participants will have 39 visits over 6 months. These include:

        -  Repeat of screening tests

        -  MRIs at 5 visits: Participants lie on a table that slides into a cylinder that takes
           pictures of the brain. They respond to images while in the scanner.

        -  iTBS at 10 visits (5 days a week for 2 weeks)

      Participants will be contacted throughout the study to discuss iTBS treatment and drug use.

      Objectives: Illicit drug use affects tens of millions of Americans and costs nearly $200
      billion annually in health care costs and lost productivity. Cocaine dependence accounts for
      25% of reported lifetime drug dependence though few successfully abstain with treatment. For
      efforts toward positive long-term outcomes, it is imperative to identify risk factors of poor
      outcomes, specialized treatments, neural mechanisms that change with treatment, and
      predictive measures of treatment outcomes. Substance abusers are known to have dysregulation
      in cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control, and intrinsic network connectivity.
      Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has proven effective at reducing drug craving in
      nicotine, alcohol, and cocaine users. Here, intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a
      type a NIBS, delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is implemented to
      modulate substance abuse related circuit dysregulations and assess effectiveness of iTBS in
      promoting abstinence.

      Study population: Recruitment from the Baltimore, Maryland area will take place for this
      protocol. For the Pilot, 20 cocaine dependent (CD) individuals will be recruited. For the
      Clinical Trial, 50 healthy adults (HC) and 100 CD individuals will be recruited. All of the
      HC group will receive both active- and sham-iTBS in a within-subject crossover design. Half
      of the CD group will receive active-iTBS and half will receive sham-iTBS. The Clinical Trial
      groups will be matched on demographic measures (e.g., age, IQ, sex).

      Design: The Pilot is designed to be a tolerability pilot where iTBS parameters are assessed
      in CD participants. The first half of the Pilot participants will be inpatient (for initial
      close observations) and the second half will be outpatient (closely reflecting the clinical
      trial). Throughout the Pilot, clinical measures will be collected and participants closely
      monitored. The general outline for the Clinical Trial is to characterize the treatment cohort
      (vs. HC) and assess effectiveness of iTBS over the left dlPFC in reducing cocaine use. The
      iTBS intervention consists of 30 sessions over a 2-week (10 treatment days) period as an
      add-on to a treatment-as-usual, contingency management. Structural and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging, neural measures of cue reactivity, reward processing, executive control,
      intrinsic network connectivity along with cardiac measures will be collected to identify
      differences between CD and HC participants at baseline. In CD participants, neural and
      cardiac measure along with cocaine use will be tracked longitudinally to assess changes with
      treatment. Contingency management will continue for 13 weeks and a 3-month follow-up will be
      scheduled. The Clinical Trial includes 39 visits.

      Outcome parameters: Two main comparisons are of interest. First, baseline differences in
      neural and cardiac measures between CD and HC participants will be identified. CD
      participants are expected to show dysregulations in these functions, relative to HC
      participants. Second, neural plasticity related to these functions due to iTBS treatment and
      reduction in cocaine use will be measured. The active-iTBS intervention is expected to be
      effective in reducing cocaine use, relative to the sham-iTBS intervention. Normalization of
      circuit dysregulation is hypothesized to be associated with reduction of cocaine use.
      Overall, the current protocol is designed to test whether iTBS to left dlPFC is efficacious
      in reducing cocaine use.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - TOLERABILITY PILOT:

               1. Be able to give valid informed consent.

               2. Be 18 - 60 years of age.

                    1. Justification: Many neural processes change with age, and these changes
                       could introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI signals.

                    2. Screening tool: Self-report. Government-issued forms of identification (e.g.
                       driver s license, birth certificate)

                       3 .Right-handed.

                    1. Justification: Differences in hemispheric dominance could confound iTBS
                       administration and MRI measurements.

                    2. Screening tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.

             4. Be in good health.

               1. Justification: Many illnesses may alter neural functioning as well as fMRI
                  signals.

               2. Screening tools: Medical Assessment, Medical History and Physical Examination.
                  Medical assessments include: Vital Signs, EKG, oral HIV test, height/weight
                  measurements, urinalysis, and blood sample. Tests on the blood sample include
                  CBC, complete metabolic profile, TSH, ESR, syphilis test, and HIV (if needed to
                  confirm a positive salivary test for HIV). The following individual laboratory
                  results will independently disqualify individuals: Cholesterol &gt;250 mg/dl,
                  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl, WBC &lt; 2400/microliter, LFTs &gt; 3 X upper normal limit, HCG
                  positive, Casual serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl, Urine protein &gt; 1+, HIV positive.
                  (Serum glucose over 140 mg/dl will be followed up with a fasting serum glucose
                  assessment. Those with fasting glucose below 100 mg/dl may be considered for the
                  protocol. Others will be rejected and referred for work-up.) Liver function will
                  be evaluated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase
                  (ALT). A greater than 3 x upper normal limit for AST or ALT will disqualify
                  individuals. MAI reserves the right to exclude at less extreme lab values if
                  clinical judgment warrants exclusion.

                  5. Absence of a specific learning disability, ADHD or cognitive impairment

               1. Justification: Participants must be able to perform a cognitively challenging
                  task to a high standard.

               2. Screening tool: Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale with follow up clinical interview,
                  Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), History of placement in
                  special education classes for a learning problem.

                  6. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for current moderate to severe substance
                  (i.e., cocaine) use disorder, without a period of continuous abstinence lasting a
                  one-month period over the last year, other than in a controlled environment.

               1. Justification: cocaine use disorder, in regular users, is the focus of this
                  protocol.

               2. Screening tool: Potential diagnoses will be evaluated by a counselor using any
                  one or more of the following: Drug Use Survey, SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire,
                  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I), Addiction Severity
                  Index, and Brief Cocaine Cessation Motivation Assessment. The interviewer will
                  supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5 substance use disorders. The
                  MAI may be consulted in this determination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - TOLERABILITY PILOT:

          1. History of any neurological disorder that would increase seizure risk from iTBS such
             as stroke, brain lesions, previous neurosurgery, any history of seizure or fainting
             episode of unknown cause, or head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness, lasting
             over 30 minutes or with sequela lasting longer than one month.

               1. Justification: Stroke, vascular lesions or head trauma can lower the seizure
                  threshold, and are therefore contra-indications for iTBS. Fainting episodes or
                  syncope of unknown cause could indicate an undiagnosed condition associated with
                  seizures.

               2. Screening tool: TMS safety Screen, Medical History and clinical MRI/MRA scan.

          2. Current DSM-5 moderate-severe substance use disorder on a substance other than
             cocaine, nicotine, marijuana, or opiates (provided they are currently stable on
             Suboxone) or meeting withdrawal criteria for alcohol or a
             sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic, or tolerance criteria in an individual using 3 or more
             days/week, regardless of diagnosis. Individuals will be considered stable on

             Suboxone if they have been on a stable dose for at least 2-weeks prior to consenting
             to 17-DA-N002 and have provided at least 3 urine specimens negative for illicit
             opioids over the same 2-week period (10 business days) with at least one test
             collected within two business days of the start of the period, one collected within
             three business days of the end of the period and one collected at

             least two days from either of the other two specimens. Urine results may be gathered
             at NIDA as part of screening or be provided by the Suboxone prescriber. Communication
             between the Suboxone provider and the MAI (or covering Staff Clinician) will be
             ongoing to establish continued illicit opioid abstinence between participant clearance
             and consent to 17-DA-N002. Individuals must be receiving their Suboxone as take-home
             doses from an external (i.e., non-NIDA-IRP) provider.

               1. Justification: While use of multiple substances is the norm and some use will be
                  allowed, the focus of the current protocol is on cocaine. However, participants
                  with tolerance or withdrawal symptoms to alcohol or a
                  sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic will be at increased risk of a seizure from iTBS and
                  will therefore be excluded. Individuals receiving Suboxone and struggling with
                  cocaine use are an ecologically valid population in the greater Baltimore area
                  and do not increase risk of seizure.

               2. Screening tool: Drug Use Survey and SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire or
                  M.I.N.I). The interviewer will supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5
                  substance use disorders. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated with a
                  clinical interview with a counselor.

          3. First-degree family history of any neurological disorder with a potentially hereditary
             basis, including migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis.

               1. ustification: Neurological disorders can lower the seizure threshold, and are
                  therefore contra-indications for iTBS. First-degree family history of certain
                  neurological disorders with a hereditary component increases the risk of the
                  participant having an undiagnosed condition that is associated with lowered
                  seizure threshold.

               2. Screening tool: TMS safety screening, Medical History.

          4. Cardiac pacemakers, neural stimulators, implantable defibrillator, implanted
             medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease, with
             intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or
             electrodes) or any other metal object in the body that precludes iTBS administration.

               1. Justification: Certain metal in the body is a contra-indication for iTBS
                  administration, as this method involves exposure to a relatively strong static
                  magnetic field that can move magnetic material not securely bound and rapidly
                  alternating magnetic fields that can generate heat and current in metal contained
                  in the body.

               2. Screening tool: Medical History, TMS safety screen.

          5. Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus.

               1. Justification: individuals with noise-induced hearing problems may be
                  particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by iTBS equipment.

               2. Screening tools: TMS safety screening.

          6. Current use (any use in the past 4 weeks, daily use for more than a week within past 6
             months) of any investigational drug or of any medications with psychotropic (e.g.,
             benzodiazepines), anti or pro-convulsive action, or anti-coagulants. This will be
             determined at the discretion of the MAI.

               1. Justification: The use of certain medications or drugs can lower seizure
                  threshold during use or withdrawal and is therefore contra-indicated for iTBS.
                  Such medications may also alter neural functioning independent of the individual
                  s drug use or the effects of the iTBS and thus add more variability to our data.

               2. Screening tools: MRI safety screening questionnaire, Medical history, Medical
                  Assessments: Urine toxicology analyzes for presence of a broad range of
                  prescription and nonprescription drugs.

          7. Lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

               1. Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy population with no
                  psychiatric disorders other than substance use disorders. In participants with
                  bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania, there is a small chance that iTBS can
                  trigger (hypo)manic symptoms. As some degree of depressive symptoms is common in
                  cocaine dependence and may result from the drug use, mild unipolar depression
                  will not be exclusionary.

               2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire or M.I.N.I. Potential
                  diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counselor.

          8. History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,
             stroke or transient ischemic attack, mitral valve prolapse, or any heart condition
             currently under medical care.

               1. Justifications: the risk of iTBS for individuals with a heart condition is
                  unknown and advanced cardiovascular disease is incompatible with the goal of
                  studying subclinical CAD. These conditions are also likely to add considerable
                  additional variability to the data.

               2. Screening tool: physical assessment (EKG), medical history.

          9. Pregnant or lactating women or women with reproductive potential who engage in
             heterosexual sex that may lead to pregnancy and not using a medically acceptable form
             of contraception (such as birth control pills, condoms, or a diaphragm with
             spermicide).

               1. Justification: it is unknown whether iTBS poses a risk to fetuses.

               2. Screening tool: Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests, and clinical interview.

         10. Participation in any NIBS session (excluding the current protocol) less than two weeks
             ago. No NIBS exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6 months.

               1. Justification: in order to avoid possible carry-over effects from previous
                  exposure to NIBS prior to participation in the proposed intervention, we will not
                  enroll participants who have received any NIBS in the two weeks preceding
                  enrollment or treatment with NIBS modality with the last 6 months preceding
                  enrollment.

               2. Screening tool: TMS safety screen.

        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION - MAIN STUDY:

        The same inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used as in the Pilot with the exception
        of:

          1. CD participants, and not HC participants, will meet current DSM-5 criteria for current
             moderate to severe substance (i.e., cocaine) use disorder and currently seeking
             treatment.

               1. Justification: cocaine use disorder is the focus of this protocol.

               2. Screening tool: Drug Use Survey and SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire. The
                  interviewer will supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5 substance use
                  disorders. Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counselor.

          2. Treatment seeking CD participants will be recruited.

               1. Justification: The population of interest is CD dependent individuals motivated
                  to reduce or eliminate their cocaine use.

               2. Screening tools: Cocaine use, Pattern, and Withdrawal Questionnaire.

          3. HC participants will not currently meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate to severe
             substance use disorder (excluding nicotine), and in the past, will not meet DSM-5
             criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder for cannabis or alcohol in the
             past 5 years or ever for other illicit substances. HC will not meet current tolerance
             or withdrawal criteria for alcohol or sedative/hypnotics/anxiolytics. Urine toxicology
             positive for any illicit substance inconsistent with history given will also be
             exclusionary.

               1. Justification: The population of interest is a healthy control population with no
                  substance use disorder. Current use of illicit substances or alcohol could impact
                  on seizure threshold and is therefore contra-indicated for iTBS.

               2. Screening tools: SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire. The interviewer will
                  supplement SCID with questions to assess for DSM-5 substance use disorders.
                  Potential diagnoses will be further evaluated by a counsellor, Drug Use Survey
                  (DUS), Substance Use Disorder Evaluation, Medical Assessments: urine qualitative
                  drug screen is performed for cocaine, THC, benzo, morphine/opiates, MDMA,
                  amphetamine /methamphetamine, methadone, buprenorphine, PCP, and oxycodone.

          4. Participation in any NIBS session less than two weeks prior to admission (including
             the Pilot of this protocol but excluding ongoing participation in the Clinical Trial
             of the current protocol). No NIBS exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6
             months.

               1. Justification: in order to avoid possible carry-over effects from previous
                  exposure to NIBS prior to participation in the proposed intervention, we will not
                  enroll participants who have received any NIBS in the two weeks preceding
                  enrollment or treatment with NIBS modality with the last 6 months preceding
                  enrollment. Also, because the current scientific goals of this protocol is to
                  assess the effectiveness of 30 iTBS sessions in relation to treating CD,
                  participants who received iTBS sessions in the Pilot will be excluded.

               2. Screening tool: TMS safety screening questionnaire.
