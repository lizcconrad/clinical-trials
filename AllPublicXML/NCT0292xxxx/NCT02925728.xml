  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The undernourishment and the prevention of its risk at the elderly person in seniors's
      resident represent a major issue in public health. The diagnosis of undernourishment and its
      risk are systematically recommended in these structures where the nutrition of these people
      is a problem because often inappropriate for their capacities of prehension and consequently
      for their nutritional needs. One of the solutions to remedy can be found in the &quot; finger-food
      &quot;.

      The study FIFO (&quot;Finger-Food&quot;) suggests verifying the hypothesis which the finger-food would
      allow to increase the nutritional intake of the resident who have disorders of the prehension
      and\or requiring a nutritional stimulation and\or require an help to the preparation of the
      meal.
