  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The procedure currently recommended for the treatment of irreversible pulpitis is the
      endodontic treatment, i.e. the complete elimination of the pulp, disinfection and obturation
      of the whole root canal system. The emergency procedure consists of a pulpotomy, followed at
      an ulterior appointment by the root canal treatment. The purpose of the present pilot study
      is to evaluate the feasibility of performing the pulpotomy as a permanent treatment in mature
      molars. If hemostasis can be achieved after removing the coronal part of the pulp, a
      tricalcium silicate cement will be directly applied on the remaining pulp at the root canal
      entrances. A short-term follow-up will be performed at one week by evaluating the pain relief
      of the patient. Long-term success will then be evaluated every year by verifying the absence
      of periapical radiolucency on the x-ray as well as the absence of clinical symptoms and
      signs. A standard root canal procedure will serve as control.

    <description>The patient will benefit from a conventional treatment : a root canal treatment.
The root canal treatment consists of removing the pulp tissue from all the canals, disinfecting the root canal system with sodium hypochlorite and filling the root with a root canal sealer and gutta percha.</description>
