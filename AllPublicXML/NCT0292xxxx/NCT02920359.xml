  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of the generation of biological samples (in urine) positive to leuprorelin
      acetate for doping control by new developed methods, and establish the analytical parameters
      that reveal the administration of Leuprorelin acetate in healthy volunteers with these
      methods.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male volunteers aged from 18 to 45 years.

          2. Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent
             form.

          3. A health profile devoid of organic or physiological disorders.

          4. The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should
             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted
             if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are
             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be
             justified in writing specifically.

          5. Body mass index (BMI=weigh/height2) will range between 19 and 25 Kg/m2 and weight
             between 50 and 100 kg. BMI between 25 and 27 kg/m2 can be included by principal
             investigator criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non compliance of the inclusion criteria.

          2. History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active
             substance, similar nonapeptides or any excipients.

          3. History of allergy or adverse reactions to any medication.

          4. Subjects for which the drug involved in the study is counter indicated.

          5. History or clinical evidence of gastrointestinal, liver, renal or other disorders
             which may lead to suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion, or that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs.

          6. History or clinical evidence of alcoholism, drug abuse, or regular use of psychoactive
             drugs.

          7. Have been volunteer in another study with drugs in the last 3 months prior to start
             this study.

          8. Have taken part in studies with blood donation in the last 2 months prior to start
             this study.

          9. Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the six months prior to start
             this study.

         10. A prior history of or presence of significant cardiovascular, neurological,
             haematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine,
             immunologic or renal disease that, in the investigator's opinion, considering the
             current state of the art, they are clinically significant, are life-threatening for
             the subjects and could interfere with the product assessment. Especially seizures or a
             history of epilepsy.

         11. Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions, except for vitamins,
             herbal remedies or dietary supplements if, in the investigator's opinion, considering
             the current state of the art, they are not clinically significant, are not
             life-threatening for the subjects and do not interfere with the product assessment.
             The treatment with single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the
             week prior to the study sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is
             calculated that it has been cleared completely the day of the experimental session.

         12. Smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day in the last 3 months prior to start this
             study.

         13. Taking more than 40 g of alcohol per day.

         14. Drinking more than 5 cups per day of coffee, tea, coke, stimulants or equivalent, or
             drinks containing xanthines, in the 3 months prior to start this study.

         15. Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures
             requested to be followed.

         16. Subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B, C or HIV.

         17. Subjects with anormal values of testosterone or prostate-specific antigen according to
             age normal values.
