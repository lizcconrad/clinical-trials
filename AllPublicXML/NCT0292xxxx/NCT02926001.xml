  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate formally the short term impacts of the tax policy
      applied to Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) in Chile. The Impuesto Adicional a las Bebidas
      Analcoh√≥licas (IABA, or &quot;additional tax on soft drinks&quot;) in Chile was enacted in October
      2014, affecting any non-alcoholic beverages to which colorants, flavourings or sweeteners
      have been added. For beverages above an added sugar concentration of at least 6.25 grams per
      100ml (or equivalent proportion), the tax was increased from 13% to 18%, while for those
      below this threshold the tax was decreased to 10%, producing an 8% tax difference between
      these beverage groups. This impact evaluation analysis of the Chilean sugar-sweetened
      beverage (SSB) tax will estimate the impact of increasing the tax as well as decreasing the
      tax on soft drinks. The study will use household level grocery purchasing data for Chile. The
      purchasing records are available from October 2011 to September 2015 (three years before; and
      one year after the implementation of the tax in October 2014). The investigators will use a
      series of quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate the causal impact of the SSB tax policy
      on consumers' behaviour as well as on industry responses in the form of pricing and price
      promotion decisions.
