  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bifurcation ABSORB OCT Trial is a prospective, randomized (1:1) evaluation of the
      efficacy and performance of single ABSORB everolimus eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold
      provisional strategy in the treatment of (a) coronary bifurcation lesion(s) in consecutive
      subjects with and without fenestration towards the side branch.

      Patients included in this study will be divided into three different cohorts:

        -  Cohort A (patient 1-20): Angiographic FU with OCT at 12 months.

        -  Cohort B (patient 21-40): Angiographic FU with OCT at 24 months.

        -  Cohort C (patient 41-60): Angiographic FU with OCT at 36 months.

      All patients will also have telephone FU at 30 days, 12, 24 and 36 months.

      Inclusion of patients in the BISORB OCT trial stopped in November 2016 after safety concerns
      of the ABSORB BVS were reported. BISORB OCT included 3 patients, which were all included in
      the Academic Medical Center

    <measure>Number and appearance of jailed side branch struts, as assessed with three-dimensional OCT - Cohort A</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>3D reconstruction assessment is done visually and the number of strut free compartments are categorized as follows: Non-jailed side branch or jailed side branch. Non-jailed side branch is defined as either no strut over the sidebranch is present or 1 of the BVS struts is present over the side branch but does not compartmentalize the side branch. Jailed side branch is defined as the BVS struts separate the side branch ostium into n compartments. The distribution of the struts creates different patterns of compartments: V, T, H, double V, double T, and double H.</description>
