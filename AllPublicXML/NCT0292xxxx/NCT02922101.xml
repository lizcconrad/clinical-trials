  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a quality improvement toolbox to an online audit and
      feedback intervention in Dutch intensive care units. The toolbox comprises for each quality
      indicator (e.g., percentage of patients per shift whose pain is measured) a list of potential
      bottlenecks in the care process (e.g., staff is unaware of the prevailing guidelines for
      measuring pain every shift), associated recommendations for actions to solve mentioned
      bottlenecks (e.g., organize an educational training session), and supporting materials to
      facilitate implementation of the actions (e.g., a slide show presentation discussing the
      importance and relevance of measuring pain every shift). Half of the participating intensive
      care units will only receive online feedback, while the other half will additionally gain
      access to the integrated toolbox to facilitate planning and executing actions.

    <description>&quot;Adequately managed&quot; is defined: pain measured AND (acceptable pain score OR (unacceptable pain score AND normalized within 1 hour)). The primary outcome measure is a composite score of four quality indicators (= secondary outcome measures).The measure is limited to only patients' first 12 shifts to prevent bias from patients with a long stay. There are 3 shifts in 1 day.</description>
