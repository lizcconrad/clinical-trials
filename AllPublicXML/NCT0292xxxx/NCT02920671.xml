  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are recruiting adults (men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive) with a
      confirmed genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Investigators are also recruiting both
      obese and normal-weight healthy volunteers (men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive)
      without a family history of mitochondrial disease to compare to affected individuals.

      The study involves non-invasive MRI methods and glucose tests to focus on the relationship
      between mitochondrial disease, obesity, and the risk of diabetes. All study visit procedures
      will be completed within 2 days, which includes an overnight stay at the Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania. There are no study medications or sedations, and participants
      will be continually monitored during minimally-invasive procedures (e.g., blood draws).

      All participants will be able to receive compensation. Furthermore, it may be possible to
      provide reimbursement for travel, lodging, and meals for individuals with mitochondrial
      disease.

      Investigators hope that this research will contribute to the current knowledge of
      mitochondrial disease and that it will improve diagnostic and treatment approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although obesity is a significant public health problem, why obesity leads to diabetes in
      some individuals but not others is poorly understood. Mitochondrial impairment, particularly
      in skeletal muscle with its high energy requirement, has been implicated in the pathogenesis
      of obesity-related insulin resistance. In addition, individuals with genetic disorders
      affecting mitochondrial function are at increased risk of diabetes. The proposed studies will
      investigate the association between skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity
      (OXPHOS), which is a dimension of mitochondrial function, and glucose and lipid homeostasis
      in (i) individuals with genetic disorders of muscle mitochondrial function as compared to
      (ii) non-obese adults and (iii) otherwise healthy obese adults.

      During a single 2-day, 1-night study visit, investigators will use innovative, non-invasive
      magnetic resonance imaging-based methods of estimating skeletal muscle oxidative
      phosphorylation capacity, including post-exercise chemical exchange saturation transfer
      (CrCEST) recovery and 31-Phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and muscle
      lipid content, including 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 3-point Dixon
      techniques, in conjunction with a tracer-enhanced oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT*) to
      measure overall insulin sensitivity and the selective effect of insulin on glucose disposal
      (Rd). The percentage suppression of endogenous glucose production by the oral glucose load (%
      suppression of Ra of endogenous glucose) will also be assessed. Infusion of a glycerol tracer
      permits assessment of lipolysis in both the fasting state, and also after the oral glucose
      load, such that the percentage suppression of lipolysis by the oral glucose load can also be
      calculated (% suppression of Ra of glycerol). In addition, the insulin and c-peptide minimal
      models will also be used to model pancreatic Î²-cell responsiveness to the oral glucose load
      and hepatic insulin extraction.

        study:

          1. Male and female patients age 18 to 65 years of age.

        For individuals with mitochondrial disease:

        Clinical history consistent with the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, and molecular
        genetic diagnosis. To ensure consistency with other trials performed in mitochondrial
        disease, investigators will also ensure that participants meet the same set of previously
        published criteria. These include clinical features consistent with primary mitochondrial
        disease and molecular genetic proof of a pathogenic mutation in mtDNA or nDNA in a gene
        known to be associated with dysfunction of complexes I-V of the respiratory chain.
        Specifically, eligible participants must have defined mtDNA or nDNA mutations affecting
        subunits or assembly of these complexes that are associated with known
        clinical/pathological features, such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (CPEO), Kearns-Sayre, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
        episodes (MELAS), mitochondrial encephalopathy and ragged red fibers (MERRF), neuropathy,
        ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) or Leigh syndrome (45). Investigators will
        explicitly include individuals with Friedreich's Ataxia (46), a mutation in the
        mitochondrial protein frataxin, and those with mutations in respiratory chain complex II
        protein, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).

        For normal weight participants:

        BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2. These will be matched with subjects with mitochondrial disease by age, sex,
        estrogen status (women), and usual self-reported physical activity (as either sedentary or
        not, i.e., for sedentary, less than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days per
        week, or vigorous physical activity for 20 minutes 3 days per week).

        For obese participants:

        BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2. These will be matched with subjects with mitochondrial disease by age, sex,
        estrogen status (women), and usual self-reported physical activity (as either sedentary or
        not, i.e., for sedentary, less than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days per
        week, or vigorous physical activity for 20 minutes 3 days per week).

             using the subject's measure serum creatinine and the Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease [MDRD] study estimation formula).

          5. Liver disease. Persistent elevation of liver function tests at the time of study
             entry. Persistent SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), Alk Phos or total bilirubin, with values &gt; 3

             long-term anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin) (low-dose aspirin treatment is
             allowed) or patients with an INR &gt; 1.5.

         11. For female participants: Positive pregnancy test.

         12. Known active alcohol or substance abuse, including known tobacco use.
