  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single centre study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an experimental stannous
      fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) after short term
      use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, three day, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm,
      parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected
      test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet
      all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. DH will be assessed at
      baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3 days twice daily use.

    <description>The examiner will indicate the participant's response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale as follows: 0 Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3 Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in tactile threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allows the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force is reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth is determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses is recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g.</description>
