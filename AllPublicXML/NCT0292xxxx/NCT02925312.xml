  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MedStar Diabetes Institute (MDI), in partnership with key MedStar Health system diabetes
      stakeholders, seeks to implement an evidence-based innovative integrated care pathway for
      MedStar patients with uncontrolled diabetes which will demonstrate improvement in diabetes
      care outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The program is designed to bring diabetes specialty services to Primary Care practices
           to support PCPs and their patients in improving diabetes-related outcomes.

        -  High-risk patients from MedStar Primary Care practices who have uncontrolled type 2
           diabetes and meet the target population inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited
           to participate in an intensive and concise medication management and education
           intervention of ~4-8 weeks duration.

        -  The intervention will consist of three key components: (1) intensive, algorithm-based
           medication management (Appendix A), based on continuous review and management of blood
           sugars; (2) survival skills diabetes self-management education; (3) enhanced
           patient-provider communication, all provided by Endocrinologist supervised allied health
           professionals (in this instance CDEs).

        -  Survival skills DSME will focus on nutrition and meal plan basics, blood glucose
           targets, taking medications as prescribed, hyper- and hypoglycemia recognition and
           treatment, and when to seek medical help.

        -  The intervention will start with one to two face-to-face meetings with the CDE, to be
           followed by virtual meetings though a variety of media based on patient preference and
           health literacy.

        -  Various technology tools will be used to facilitate patient engagement and attainment of
           glycemic targets, including smart meters, virtual meeting platforms, web-based education
           content and surveys via tablets, etc.

        -  Concurrent matched charts of patients receiving standard care at the three MedStar
           locations will serve as a basis of comparison in assessing the impact of MDI on clinical
           and education outcomes and process of care.

        -  Based on patient progress towards improved glycemic control, the patient will 'graduate'
           from the program and the CDE will refer the patient back to their PCP in 8-12 weeks with
           a full report of medication changes, blood glucose readings and further diabetes
           management recommendations eg referrals; further DSME, etc.
