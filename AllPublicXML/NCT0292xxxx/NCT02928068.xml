      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a 12 week telehealth intervention
      for families of children with autism spectrum disorders under the age of 6 years on child
      participation and parent efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly being diagnosed in children, creating a
      pressing need for effective and cost-efficient models of early intervention (EI) services.
      Many EI systems are struggling to meet the needs of the increasing number of families of
      children with ASD. In rural areas, there is a shortage of EI therapists, and the distances to
      reach families results in an inefficient use of professional time and research shows that
      rural families of children with ASD receive fewer EI services, which has detrimental effects
      on children's developmental trajectories. If occupational therapy interventions for young
      children with ASD utilize innovative methods of service delivery in rural areas,
      investigators can increase the number of families that receive services thereby positively
      influencing child and family outcomes. Therefore, investigators propose to test the
      acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and efficacy of a 12 week telehealth intervention for
      families of young children with ASD.

    <description>OPC focuses on increasing positive child-caregiver interactions and child learning opportunities in everyday routines and contexts, which positions families for improved trajectories over time. OPC capitalizes on families' strengths, while supporting caregivers in using their own resources and ideas to advance child function. Caregivers identify goals, while therapists ask reflective questions and make reflective comments, affording caregivers an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of their own current knowledge and the impact of their strategies on their children's adaptive behavior. Thus, families generate their own solutions and are ultimately responsible for carrying out the intervention and evaluating its effectiveness.</description>
