    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and tolerability of S 055746 in
      patients with AML, and high or very high risk MDS, in terms of Dose-Limiting Toxicities
      (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)
      through safety profile (DLT, MTD), PK profile, PD profile and preliminary efficacy.
