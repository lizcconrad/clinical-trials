      The goals of this project are aimed at the following:

        1. Identifying psychiatric comorbidity in patients presenting to the HNSCS clinic 1F and
           Duke Otolaryngology of Raleigh clinic using the validated assessment tool Brief Symptom
           Inventory (BSI-18) and the patient control scale. The BSI-18 is an 18 question and
           patient control an 8 item tool that takes about four minutes to complete.

        2. Gathering data regarding patient satisfaction in new patients to the HNSCS clinics via
           the CG-CAHPS visit survey.

        3. Examining relationships between psychiatric comorbidity and patient satisfaction.

        4. Examining relationships between psychiatric comorbidity and healthcare system use.

    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple otolaryngology complaints experience psychosocial distress. This
      psychosocial distress can have an adverse effect on treatment outcomes for the primary
      complaint and on the overall patient experience. It can result in greater costs for more care
      that may not be best-directed. This has implications not only for the patients, but also for
      providers' quality metrics.

      Data will be collected via surveys and a chart review. New patients at the Duke Clinic 1F and
      Duke Raleigh Otolaryngology will be asked to complete the BSI-18, patient control scale, and
      disease specific outcome measure upon patient intake by the clinic nurse. The CG-CAHPS Visit
      Survey 2.1 will be completed at the conclusion of the clinical encounter. Patient
      participation consists of these surveys on their initial visit only.

      The PI and/or a resident will conduct a chart review of these patients looking for history of
      psychiatric diagnoses and/or related prescriptions. Patients who have psychiatric diagnoses
      and/or prescriptions in the chart will be considered to have their needs &quot;met&quot;, in that they
      are receiving care. Data regarding diagnoses and prescriptions will also be entered into
      REDCap.
