  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single site study evaluates the efficacy of ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis using
      EKOS Endovascular Device with a standard infusion of thrombolytics for treatment of PE
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical trials examining thrombolytics used to treat Acute Submassive PE, many
      times will use fixed dose and duration. Little research has been conducted on the physiologic
      implication of resolution of symptoms. It seems reasonable, that symptomatic relief results
      from some degree of hemodynamic normalization. This study will seek to examine the extent to
      which the hemodynamic impairment is normalized from a thrombolytic treatment protocol with an
      endpoint of therapy determined as resolution of presenting symptoms. Treatment plans will
      utilize the MBS (Modified Borg Scale) score to help evaluate and measure outcome-based care,
      quantifying shortness of breath.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute symptomatic PE confirmed by CT, with filling defect in at least one main or
             segmental pulmonary artery.

          2. RV dysfunction as evidenced by RV/LV ratio &gt; 0.9 on echo

          3. Ability to give informed consent or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is able to
             give consent

          4. PE symptom duration &lt; 21 days

          5. Age &gt;18 years

          6. And, a MBS baseline measurement above 3 plus at least one of the following: O2 sat &lt;
             90% RA, or inability to maintain a HR &lt;100, or inability to maintain a Systolic Bp &gt;
             100. Whichever measurement is chosen for inclusion criteria in addition to the MBS
             will also be used in determination of therapeutic endpoint (i.e. O2 Sat., HR&lt;100 or BP
             &gt;100)..

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), head trauma, or other active intracranial
             or intraspinal disease within one year

          2. Recent (within one month) or active bleeding from a major organ

          3. Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt; 8.0

          4. Platelets &lt; 60 thousand/µL

          5. Major surgery within seven days

          6. Clinician deems high-risk for catastrophic bleeding

          7. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

          8. Pregnancy

          9. Catheter-based pharmacomechanical treatment for pulmonary embolism within 3 days of
             study enrollment

         10. Systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg despite vasopressor or inotropic support

         11. Cardiac arrest (including pulseless electrical activity and asystole) requiring active
             cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

         12. Evidence of irreversible neurological compromise

         13. Life expectancy &lt; 30 days

         14. Use of thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists within 3 days prior to
             inclusion in the study
