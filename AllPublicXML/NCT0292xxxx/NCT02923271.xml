      Research participants and their parents will be recruited to take part in a randomized
      control trial. Participants' and their parents' cellphone use will be observed during an
      initial baseline period. Participants and their parents will then be randomly assigned to one
      of two conditions: opt-out blocking with parental notification, opt-out blocking with
      bidirectional notification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, 3,328 people were killed and an additional 421,000 were injured in crashes involving
      a distracted driver. Adults aged greater than 40 years old accounted for 44% of these
      fatalities. Teen driving behavior is heavily influenced by parental driving behaviors with a
      recent study showing the proportion of teens that text while driving is 14% higher if they
      have observed their parents doing the same. The proportion of adults who text while driving
      has recently surpassed teen rates with a 2013 national poll finding 49% of adult car
      commuters admit to texting while driving, most stating that they did it out of habit. Based
      on previous findings, it is unlikely that teens will reduce their texting while driving
      unless their parents do the same.

      The objective of this study is to compare measures of acceptance and feasibility across
      teen-parent dyads randomized to bidirectional teen-parent (teen monitors parent and parent
      monitors teen) vs. teen only (parent monitors teen) cellphone use while driving.

      Research participants will be recruited to take part in a randomized control trial.
      Participants' cellphone use will be observed during an initial baseline period. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (bidirectional teen-parent monitoring or
      parental monitoring of the teen only). An exit survey and interview will be administered to
      both the parent and teen separately at the end of the study.

    <description>Cellcontrol DriveID device will automatically turn on when the teen or parent begins driving and will be pre-set to block all calls and text messages when the car is in motion but participants will have the ability to override the blocking. The teen-parent monitoring group involves will send email notifications to the teen when their parent unlocks their phone while driving and vice versa.
Participants (parents and teens) will self-report information on their individual driving behaviors for the three weeks prior to study enrollment, including how often they report texting while driving and self-report cellphone use. At the end of the study participants will be asked to report feedback about the use the cellphone blocking technology and their perceptions for whether their safety improved using the technology.</description>

    <description>Cellcontrol DriveID device will automatically turn on when the teen or parent begins driving and will be pre-set to block all calls and text messages when the car is in motion but participants will have the ability to override the blocking. The teen only group involves parental monitoring of the teen's cellphone use while driving only. The parent will receive an email notification when their teen unlocks their phone while driving. Both parents and teens will drive under the same restrictions, but only the parent is notified of teen cellphone use.
Participants (parents and teens) will self-report information on their individual driving behaviors for the three weeks prior to study enrollment, including how often they report texting while driving and self-report cellphone use. At the end of the study participants will be asked to report feedback about the use the cellphone blocking technology and their perceptions for whether their safety improved using the technology.</description>
