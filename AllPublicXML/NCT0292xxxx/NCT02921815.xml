      To analyze the occurrence of transformation from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute
      myeloid leukemia (hereinafter referred to as transformation from MDS to AML) in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality (hereinafter referred to
      as del(5q)MDS) who received Revlimid® 5 mg Capsules (hereinafter referred to as Revlimid) and
      who are continuing or no longer continuing Revlimid treatment.

        1. Planned registration period This period started on the date of initial marketing of
           Revlimid and will end on the day when the appropriateness of enrollment is assessed for
           all del(5qMDS) patients in the all-case surveillance.

        2. Planned surveillance period This period started on the date of initial marketing of
           Revlimid and will end 3 years after the last enrolled patient begins receiving Revlimid.
