    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of talimogene laherparepvec and radiation
      therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed soft tissue
      sarcoma that can be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as talimogene
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses
      high energy x-rays, photons. electrons, or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving talimogene laherparepvec and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients
      with soft tissue sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the pathologic complete necrosis rate (the number of patients with &gt;= 95%
      necrosis divided by the number of evaluable patients) following preoperative treatment with
      talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with radiation in patients with localized
      soft tissue sarcoma including a pre-planned interim safety analysis to assess post-surgical
      wound complications.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with
      radiation in localized soft tissue sarcomas, during neo-adjuvant treatment and post-surgical
      resection wound complications.

      II. To estimate the rate of radiologic response, prior to surgery, and extent of surgical
      resection.

      III. To estimate time to surgery, time to progression, time to recurrence, and death.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the clinical outcomes within three distinct histologic subtypes:
      liposarcoma (excluding myxoid liposarcoma), leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic
      sarcoma.

      II. To characterize the percentage of tumor necrosis in treated tumors. III. To assess if the
      combination of preoperative talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) with radiation will increase the
      expression of PD-L1 in soft tissue sarcomas.

      IV. To assess the impact of preoperative talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) with radiation on
      the tumor infiltrating and circulating immune cells in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) at weeks 1, 4, 6 and 8.
      Beginning 8-10 days after start of talimogene laherparepvec, patients undergo radiation
      therapy at weeks 2-6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every year for up to 5 years.
