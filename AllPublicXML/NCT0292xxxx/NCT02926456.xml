  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effectiveness of darunavir/cobicistat
      (DRV/c)-based regimens, measured as maintenance of virological suppression 48 weeks after
      baseline, defined as the day when the treatment with DRV/c-based regimen is started, through
      collection of daily practice data in the Italian setting.

    <description>The percentage of patients with plasma HIV-RNA&lt;50 copies/mL will be analyzed by FDA snapshot analysis (FDA Snapshot Approach is based on the last observed viral load data within the Week 48 window: virologic response is defined as HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (observed case)余 If there are no data in the defined time window, the proportion of missing data and relative reason will be provided&quot;) and Time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) method algorithm requires sustained HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL余 confirmed HIV-1 RNA more than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 copies/mL is considered as non-response (rebound)余 patients considered non-responder after permanent discontinuation).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HIV-Symptoms Distress Module (HIV-SDM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to Visit 4 (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>HIV-SDM is a questionnaire consisting of 20 questions related to all the symptoms which the patient might have had during the past four weeks. For each question patient has to select appropriate answer related to the symptoms: &quot;0 = I do not have this symptom; 1 = I have this symptom and it doesn't bother me; 2 = it bothers me a little; 3 = it bothers me; 4 = it bothers me a lot&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HIV-Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIV-TSQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to Visit 4 (Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>The HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIV-TSQ) is a 10-item instrument that is supported by evidence of good internal consistency reliability. The total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater treatment satisfaction. Score change ranges from -30 to +30, with scores&lt;0 and &gt;0 indicating a decrease and increase in treatment satisfaction, respectively.</description>
