    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of deep brain
      stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (also called the &quot;nbM&quot;) at improving memory in
      Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairments and memory difficulties.
      Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) that are eligible for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
      therapy for improvement of their motor symptoms and with evidence of mild cognitive
      impairments and memory difficulties will be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blind (patient and neuropsychologist), randomized, cross-over
      study to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert
      (nbM) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) who are
      undergoing globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation for their motor symptoms. Six patients
      with PD who are eligible for GPi DBS for improvement of their motor symptoms and who have a
      clinical diagnosis of PD-MCI (amnestic, single or multiple domain) per Movement Disorder
      Society (MDS) criteria will be enrolled and implanted with bilateral electrodes in in the nbM
      in addition to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Conventional stereotactic implantation of
      the electrodes will be guided by intraoperative computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic
      resonance tomography (MRT).

    <description>Subjects will undergo activation of GPi and nbM electrodes The GPi's will be stimulated to achieve improvement in motor function. There is a double blind evaluation of DBS-nbM stimulation. Subjects will be those with nbM stimulation ON for a period of 3 months (GPi also on). No usual treatment is withheld. PD drug doses will be stable unless disabling dyskinesias warrants a reduction of medication. After initial 3 months period of stimulation subject will undergo a repeat of neuropsychological testing and Motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rating prior to switching group assignment (cross-over). There will be a 2 day wash-out period of nbM stimulation for all subjects (both the On and Off groups) in order to minimize subject bias. Then, the subjects will undergo additional brief neuropsychological testing to asses for carry over effects. The subjects will then be switched to the alternate nbM stimulation group (cross-over) from their previous 3 month period.</description>
