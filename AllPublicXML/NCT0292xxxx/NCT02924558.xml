  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of replacing some refined starches and
      added sugars with a combination of egg protein and unsaturated fatty acids on markers of
      cardiometabolic health in men and women with hypertriglyceridemia.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a combination of egg protein and
      unsaturated fatty acids acting as substitutes for ~16% of energy from refined carbohydrate on
      the metabolic profile of men and women with elevated triglycerides. This is a randomized,
      controlled feeding, crossover trial that includes two screening/baseline visits, two 3-week
      treatment conditions, and a 2-week washout phase. Subjects consume a standardized background
      diet (7-day rotating menu) that incorporates at least 3 servings/day of study test foods,
      providing 40-60% of subjects' daily energy needs. Study test foods consist of yogurt,
      muffins, waffles, and cookies. The test foods account for 8% higher protein energy (from egg
      protein) and 8% higher fat energy (from unsaturated fatty acids) in the Active Condition
      compared to the Control Condition. In the Control Condition, the study foods account for 16%
      higher carbohydrate energy. The overall macronutrient composition of each condition is as
      follows: Active Condition, approximately 42/23/35% kcal from carbohydrate/protein/fat,
      respectively, and Control Condition, approximately 58/15/27% kcal from
      carbohydrate/protein/fat, respectively. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and end
      of treatment for measurement of metabolic parameters, and a liquid meal tolerance test (LMTT)
      will be conducted at baseline and the end of each treatment period.
