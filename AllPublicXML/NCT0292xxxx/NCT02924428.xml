    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of facial acne vulgaris treatment using
      the Venus Versa Diamondpolar applicator in combination with the Venus Versa AC dual
      applicator using two intense pulsed light wavelength bands.

      Multi-center, prospective, open-label study utilizing before-after study design. Up to 20
      healthy subjects, age 18 - 55 years with acne vulgaris who wish to improve their skin
      appearance will be randomized to receive either Diamondpolar applicator (radio frequency and
      pulsed magnetic field) treatment followed by AC Dual applicator (intense pulsed light)
      treatment or AC Dual applicator (intense pulsed light) treatment alone using the Venus Versa
      system. Duration of subject participation will be approximately 10 weeks (4 weekly treatments
      with a follow-up visit scheduled 6 weeks after the last treatment).

      The AC Dual applicator (IPL) is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris by using a blue
      light (415 nm) to target porphyrins produced by the P. acne bacteria, destroying the bacteria
      and uses the red light (630 nm) to help reduce inflammation, inhibit sebum production and
      improve healing.

      The addition of the Diamondpolar applicator (RF and PEMF) treatment is thought to target the
      sebaceous gland, causing it to shrink and decrease sebum output
