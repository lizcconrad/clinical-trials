      Title: CLOSE-guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as Cure for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
      ('CLOSE to CURE' study)

      Design: This is a prospective, observational, single-center, unblinded, clinical 3-year
      study.

      Background: In a population of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) 'CLOSE'-guided PVI, a new
      approach to obtain single-procedure durable PVI, has been shown to virtually eliminate
      recurrence of AF at 1 year follow-up with repetitive but discontinuous Holter monitoring.

      Objectives: (1) To objectively compare atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATA) burden before and after
      'CLOSE'-guided based PVI using continuous monitoring. (2) To assess ATA burden using
      continuous monitoring up to 3 years after ablation. (3) To identify baseline structural and
      electrical properties of the atria or procedural characteristics that predict 1-year and
      3-year outcome.

      Enrollment: Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled in this observational, prospective study.

      Clinical Sites: 1 site.

      Subject Population: Eligible patients are patients with paroxysmal high-burden AF who are
      planned for a 'CLOSE'-guided PV isolation. At the time of procedural planning we will ask the
      patient his/her consent for (1) implantation of a subcutaneous continuous loop recorder
      (sCLR), (2) a concise electrophysiological study at the time of PVI, (3) a transthoracic
      echocardiogram at the time of PVI and (4) collection of data during 3 years. Anti-arrhythmic
      drug treatment (ADT) and oral anticoagulation (OAC) will be given according the updated 2012
      European society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on AF (Camm et al, European Heart Journal
      2012) and the 2012 Heart rhythm society (HRS)/European Heart Rhythm association/European
      cardiac arrhythmic society Expert Consensus Statement on catheter and surgical ablation of
      atrial fibrillation (Calkins et al, Heart Rhythm 2012).
