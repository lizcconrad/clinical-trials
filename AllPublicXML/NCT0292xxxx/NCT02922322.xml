      To analyze the effectiveness of mat Pilates compared to no intervention in individuals with
      chronic nonspecific low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that exercises based on the Pilates method reduce pain in chronic
      nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP). However, is noticed the lack of studies that compare the
      effectiveness of mat Pilates to no intervention in the treatment of individual with CNLBP.
      Therefore, the main objective of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of mat Pilates
      compared to no intervention in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. It is a
      randomized controlled trial with two arms and double blinded (caregiver, assessor and outcome
      assessor), composed of 30 patients, aged between 18- 65 years (±22,47) of both sexes,
      diagnosed with chronic non-specific low back pain persisting for more than three months and
      pain intensity greater than 3 points in the Pain Numerical Rating Scale. The participants
      were randomly divided into two groups: Pilates Group (n = 15), intervention based on mat
      Pilates exercises, and Control Group (n =15) with no intervention. The mat Pilates group
      performed 16 sessions, twice a week in 60-minute duration each throughout eight weeks,
      whereas the control group participants kept usual cares until the end of the intervention.
      Both groups were evaluated before and after the program by a researcher who was unaware of
      the patients' allocation. The primary assessed outcomes: pain intensity (Pain numerical
      rating scale, and McGill questionnaire), quality of life (SF-36), and disability (Oswestry
      Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire). In addition, the strength and muscle activation of
      transverse abdominal as secondary outcome assessed through the Stabilizer Pressure
      Biofeedback Unit test. As a result, the study infers that mat Pilates exercises have
      significantly improved all the evaluated outcomes. Thus, supporting clinical decisions for
      the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain.

The intervention was based on 20 out of the 34 original mat exercises proposed by the Pilates method, classified into basic, intermediate or advanced levels divided into 4 cycles of 5 exercises each. The exercises were performed during two series of 10 repetitions respecting the patients skills.</description>
