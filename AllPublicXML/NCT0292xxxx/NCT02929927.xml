At the end of the procedure, root canals were ultrasonic irrigated with 2% NaOCl ,17% ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for 1 min followed by irrigation with 0.9% normal saline to remove the smear layer ,then take the sample again,then drying the canal ,warm vertical condensation +AH-PLUS pasta,ZOE to seal the crown cavity ,one week later ,take crown restoration .Follow up at 1,7days ,3, 6,12 and 24 months.</description>
