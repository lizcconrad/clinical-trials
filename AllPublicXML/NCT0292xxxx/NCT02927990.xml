  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new software package is intended to assist the physician in imaging the coronaries during
      percutaneous coronary interventions.

      This study investigates the amount of contrast used during percutaneous coronary
      interventions with the aid of the new software package.

      The results of the study will be compared with control group data (before the new software
      package was installed or after it was removed) to define a possible contrast reduction.

    <measure>Procedure efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed from start of interventional procedure (vascular access obtained) until end of the procedure (vascular closure), ranging between 30 minutes and a few hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint is procedural timing:

time until wire placed in distal coronary bed for purpose of intervention
time of first stent placement</description>
