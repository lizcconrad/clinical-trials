    <textblock>
      This randomized prospective study compared three ablation strategies in patients with
      longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (LPeAF). It also explored the best procedural
      endpoint from among the following: circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)+left atrial
      (LA) linear lesions (roof line, mitral isthmus)+complex fractionated atrial electrogram
      (CFAE) ablation, PVI+LA linear lesions +cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation +CFAE ablation,
      and PVI+CFAE ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into three ablation groups: group A (n=100): PVI+LA linear ablation
      (roof line and mitral isthmus) +CFAE ablation; group B (n=100): PVI+linear ablation (roof
      line, mitral isthmus, and CTI) +CFAE ablation; group C (n=100), PVI+CFAE ablation.
