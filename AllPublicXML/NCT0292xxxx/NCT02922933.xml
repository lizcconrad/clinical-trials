  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the effect of concomitant drugs known to
      affect solubility of drugs through increase of intra-gastric pH levels on the bioavailability
      of entinostat.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of
      omeprazole, famotidine, and the effect of an acidic beverage on the single-dose PK profile of
      entinostat.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      entinostat when administered with multiple doses of omeprazole, famotidine, and when
      administered with an acidic beverage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study. A total of 204 subjects will be dosed in this study if Parts 2 and 3
      are conducted.

      In Part 1, in Period 1, a single dose of entinostat will be administered. In Period 2,
      multiple doses of omeprazole will be administered for 5 days with a single dose of entinostat
      co-administered. If preliminary results in Period 2 of Part 1 indicate that omeprazole
      exhibits clinically significant drug-drug interaction (DDI) with entinostat, then Parts 2 and
      3 will be conducted. If no DDI interaction is concluded between entinostat and omeprazole in
      Part 1, then neither Part 2 nor 3 will be conducted.

      Part 2 will investigate the effect of multiple doses of famotidine administration on
      entinostat PK. In Period 1, a single dose of entinostat will be administered. In Period 2,
      oral doses of famotidine with a single dose of entinostat co-administered.

      Part 3 will evaluate the effect of an acidic beverage co-administered with entinostat in
      subjects with increased gastric pH due to omeprazole treatment. In Period 1, multiple oral
      doses of omeprazole will be administered with a single dose of entinostat co-administered
      with water. In Period 2, multiple doses of omeprazole will be administered with a single dose
      of entinostat co-administered with an acidic beverage.

      In all parts, PK samples will be taken.
