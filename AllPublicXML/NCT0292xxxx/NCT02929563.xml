    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility of a large study of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically
      ill children. Children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit who are expected to
      require mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours will be randomized to intravenous
      pantoprazole 1 mg/kg or matching placebo once daily until they no longer need mechanical
      ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite sparse pediatric data on the effectiveness of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent
      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, 60% of critically ill children receive these medications.
      This may have unintended consequences - increasing the risk of nosocomial infections - which
      may be more serious and common than bleeding these drugs are prescribed to prevent. A large
      randomized trial (RCT) is needed to assess the balance of these risks and benefits, to
      determine if a strategy of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill children is
      not inferior to a strategy of routine stress ulcer prophylaxis. RCTs in pediatric critical
      care are exceptionally challenging to complete; thus, a rigorous pilot RCT is crucial. The
      pilot may prevent pursuit of a trial that is ultimately not feasible - which is ethically and
      financially responsible. It is more likely that this carefully designed pilot trial will
      ensure that the larger trial we undertake is successful.
