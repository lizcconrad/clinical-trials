  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and safety of using a new device called
      Yukio's Uterine Manipulating Instrument (YUMI). The YUMI is a type of uterine manipulator. It
      is a reusable metal device designed to be simple and study. It is also adjustable in size
      which makes it easy for surgeons to use. It will be placed at the beginning of the surgery
      and removed at the end. This study will allow the researchers to find out if the surgeons
      find the YUMI effective and easy to use. It will also allow the researchers to see if the
      device is safe. This is the first time that the YUMI is being used in humans.
