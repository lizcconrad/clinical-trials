      Advances in surgical technique have led to a more complex surgery on patients with more
      serious comorbidities and the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) such as
      pneumonia, and respiratory insufficiency, is considerable . The isolated effect of
      mobilization immediately after surgery has previously not been studied. The aim of the study
      is to evaluate the effects of immediate mobilization (within 2 hours) after abdominal
      surgery.

      Methods

      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted . A total of 200 Swedish-speaking, adult
      patients (≥18 years) planned for elective open abdominal surgery with surgery time exceeding
      2 hours are eligible for consecutive enrollment in the study. Patients who cannot walk
      independently will be excluded. Procedure: Patients will be randomized to either:

        1. Mobilization within 2 hours after surgery - sitting 1-3 hours in a chair interspaced by
           1 hour bedrest during the day of surgery or to

        2. Mobilization within 2 hours after surgery - sitting 1-3 hours in a chair interspaced by
           1 hour bedrest during the day of surgery + breathing exercises with PEP or to

        3. No mobilization - that is laying or sitting in bed with a maximum of 30° elevation of
           the head rest. No mobilization out of the bed until after 4 hours.

      Outcome assessment The primary outcome is occurrence of respiratory insufficiency defined as
      arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) &lt;8 kilo pascal (kPa) measured via arterial blood gas sample,
      or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;90%, measured peripherally with a pulse oximeter.
      Secondary outcomes are changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaO2), arterial oxygen
      pressure/fraction inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) (arterial blood gas sample) over time and
      between groups; lung function assessed as inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), forced vital
      capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in the one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow
      (PEF) by a micro spirometer; number of patients with respiratory insufficiency, defined as
      SpO2 &lt;90%, or PaO2 &lt;8kPa and/or PaCO2 ≥6.5 kPa measured without oxygen supply ; postoperative
      pneumonia and total length of stay at the wards and at the hospital.

      Clinical significance If a fairly simple and cheap intervention, such as mobilization
      immediately after open abdominal surgery, can lead to less postoperative complications,
      shortened stay at hospital in total, it should be included as a routine in postoperative
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 600 000 surgeries performed each year in Sweden. Advances in surgical
      technique have led to a more complex surgery on patients with more serious comorbidities.
      This, in turn, has led to longer operations, which expose patients to longer periods of
      anesthesia. During anesthesia, muscle relaxant is used, the diaphragm is then relaxed and
      abdominal contents are pressing against the muscle and lung tissue behind. This in
      combination with surgery, supine position and immobilization during a longer period of time,
      has a negative impact on the functional respiratory capacity (FRC) even after the surgery.
      The ability to cough is eliminated and produced secretion remains in the airways increasing
      the risk of airway closure. Therefore, the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications
      (PPC) such as pneumonia, atelectasis (collapsed airways in the lungs) and respiratory
      insufficiency, is considerable. Mobilization (to sit, stand or walk) is believed to improve
      and normalize breathing after surgery. However, the isolated effect of mobilization
      immediately after surgery has previously not been studied.

      Hypothesis We hypothesize that immediate mobilization (within 2 hours) after abdominal
      surgery will reduce postoperative respiratory insufficiency.

      Points of inquiry

        1. Can mobilization or mobilization and breathing exercises (Positive expiratory pressure
           (PEP) prevent postoperative respiratory insufficiency?

        2. Can mobilization or mobilization and breathing exercises (PEP) reduce the prevalence of
           postoperative pneumonia, shorten time at the recovery unit or total length of stay at
           the hospital? Methods A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate
           whether mobilization immediately after open abdominal surgery can reduce postoperative
           respiratory insufficiency.

      Patients A total of 200 Swedish-speaking, adult patients (≥18 years) planned for elective
      open abdominal surgery with surgery time exceeding 2 hours at Karolinska University Hospital
      Solna are eligible for consecutive enrollment in the study. Patients who cannot walk
      independently will be excluded.

      Procedure All patients will arrive at the postoperative recovery unit after the surgery where
      the randomization will take place. Patients who are considered to be in need of non-invasive
      ventilation immediate after the surgery, or when mobilization is contradicted due to the
      surgical procedure, or if they arrive to the recovery unit after 6 pm, will not be considered
      for randomization.

      Patients will be randomized to either:

        1. Mobilization within 2 hours after surgery - sitting 1-3 hours in a chair interspaced by
           1 hour bedrest during the day of surgery or to

        2. Mobilization within 2 hours after surgery - sitting 1-3 hours in a chair interspaced by
           1 hour bedrest during the day of surgery + breathing exercises with PEP or to

        3. No mobilization - that is laying or sitting in bed with a maximum of 30° elevation of
           the head rest. No mobilization out of the bed until after 4 hours.

      The study interventions will continue during 4 hours and after that all patients will receive
      the same treatment until they are transferred back to the surgical ward.

      Data collection Baseline data such as age, sex, weight, smoking history, comorbidities,
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)-classification, peripheral oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) and results from a spirometry measurement will be collected during the meeting with
      the anesthesiologist at the outpatient clinic two weeks prior to surgery. Treatment- and
      patient care data such as need for analgesics, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory
      rate will continually be registered in a bedside case report form. Time for, duration of and
      frequency of mobilization will also be registered in the study protocol. Finally, information
      of any deaths, respiratory complications such as pneumonia, patients' length of stay at the
      recovery unit and at the hospital will be obtained from medical charts.

      Outcome assessment The primary outcome is occurrence of respiratory insufficiency defined as
      arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) &lt;8 kilo pascal (kPa) (6,7), measured via arterial blood gas
      sample, or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;90%, measured peripherally with a pulse
      oximeter. Secondary outcomes are changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaO2), arterial
      oxygen pressure/fraction inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) (arterial blood gas sample) over time
      and between groups; lung function assessed as inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), forced vital
      capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in the one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow
      (PEF) by a micro spirometer; number of patients with respiratory insufficiency, defined as
      SpO2 &lt;90%, or PaO2 &lt;8kPa and/or PaCO2 ≥6.5kPa measured without oxygen supply; postoperative
      pneumonia and total length of stay at the wards and at the hospital.

      Statistical analyses The number of patients required to establish a statistical power of 80%
      and a significance level of 5%, were 63 patients for each group. Parametric or non parametric
      analyses will be used depending on data level.

      Clinical significance If a fairly simple and cheap intervention, such as mobilization
      immediately after open abdominal surgery, can lead to less postoperative complications,
      shortened stay at the postoperative recovery unit, and at the hospital in total, it should be
      included as a routine in postoperative care.

      Ethical considerations The project has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in
      Stockholm (Dnr: 2015/703-31/1). The patients will receive verbal and written information
      about the study and informed consent forms will be obtained from all participants.
