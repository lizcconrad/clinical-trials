    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1-2, open-label study in subjects with refractory DLBCL, evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in combination with atezolizumab, a humanized, monoclonal
      antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks interaction with the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. The
      trial will be separated into two distinct phases designated as phase 1 and phase 2.

          2. Chemotherapy-refractory disease, defined as one or more of the following:

               -  Stable disease (duration of stable disease must be less than or equal to 6
                  months) or progressive disease as best response to most recent chemotherapy
                  containing regimen

               -  Disease progression or recurrence less than or equal to 12 months of prior

          3. Subjects must have received adequate prior therapy including at a minimum:

               -  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody unless investigator determines that tumor is
                  CD20-negative and

               -  an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen

          4. At least one measurable lesion per revised IWG Response Criteria

             obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active
             pneumonitis per chest CT scan at screening. History of radiation pneumonitis in the
             radiation field (fibrosis) is allowed.
