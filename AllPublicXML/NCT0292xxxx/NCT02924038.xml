    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, two arm neoadjuvant vaccine study in human leukocyte antigen-A2
      positive (HLA-A2+) adults with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II glioma, for which
      surgical resection of the tumor is clinically indicated. Co-primary objectives are to
      determine: 1) the safety of the novel combination of subcutaneously administered IMA950
      peptides and poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) and i.v. administered CDX-1127 (Varlilumab) in the
      neoadjuvant approach; and 2) whether addition of i.v. CDX-1127 (Varlilumab) increases the
      response rate and magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against the IMA950 peptides in
      post-vaccine peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples obtained from participating
      patients.

      Low-grade gliomas (LGG), the most common of which are pilocytic astrocytomas, diffuse
      astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas are a diverse family of central nervous system (CNS)
      neoplasms that occur in children and adults. Based on data from the American Cancer Society
      and Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBRTUS), approximately 1,800 LGG were
      diagnosed in 2006, thus representing approximately 10% of newly diagnosed primary brain
      tumors in the United States. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I) are the most common brain
      tumor in children 5 to 19 years of age. Diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas are all
      considered WHO grade II low grade gliomas (LGG) and are more common in adults. Pilocytic
      astrocytomas are generally well circumscribed histologically and radiographically and
      amenable to cure with gross total resection. In contrast, the diffuse astrocytomas and
      oligodendrogliomas are more infiltrative and less amenable to complete resection. From a
      molecular genetics standpoint, the most common alterations in LGG are IDH1 mutations and
      mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53, located on chromosome 17, the gene product of
      which is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell death
      (apoptosis), and transcription. Additionally, several molecular factors are of favorable
      prognostic significance, particularly the presence of 1p/19q co-deletion and isocitrate
      dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations.

      WHO grade II LGGs are at risk to undergo malignant transformation into more aggressive and
      lethal WHO grade III or IV high-grade glioma (HGG). Even with a combination of available
      therapeutic modalities (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy [RT], chemotherapy), the invasive
      growth and resistance to therapy exhibited by these tumors results in recurrence and death in
      most patients. Although postoperative RT in LGG significantly improves 5-year
      progression-free survival (PFS), it does not prolong overall survival (OS) compared with
      delayed RT given at the time of progression. Early results from a randomized trial of
      radiation therapy plus procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy for
      supratentorial adult LGG (RTOG 9802) demonstrated improved PFS in patients receiving PCV plus
      RT compared RT alone. Nonetheless, PCV is considerably toxic and currently not widely used
      for management of glioma patients. Although chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) is currently
      being investigated in LGG patients, it is unknown whether it confers improved OS in these
      patients. Further, our recent study has indicated that 6 of 10 LGG cases treated with TMZ
      progressed to HGG with markedly increased exome mutations and, more worrisome, driver
      mutations in the RB and AKT-mTOR pathways, with predominant C&gt;T/G&gt;A transitions at CpC and
      CpT dinucleotides, strongly suggesting a signature of TMZ-induced mutagenesis; this study
      also showed that in 43% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial tumor were
      undetected at recurrence, while IDH mutations were the only type of mutations that persisted
      in the initial and recurrent tumors. These data suggests the possibility that treatment of
      LGG patients with TMZ may enhance oncogenic mutations and genetic elusiveness of LGG,
      therefore calling for development of safer and effective therapeutic modalities such as
      vaccines.

      Taken together, LGG are considered a premalignant condition for HGG, such that novel
      interventions to prevent malignant transformation need to be evaluated in patients with LGG.
      Immunotherapeutic modalities, such as vaccines, may offer a safe and effective option for
      these patients due to the slower growth rate of LGG (in contrast with HGG), which should
      allow sufficient time for multiple immunizations and hence high levels of anti-glioma
      immunity. Because patients with LGGs are generally not as immuno-compromised as patients with
      HGG, they may also exhibit greater immunological response to and benefit from the vaccines.
      Further, the generally mild toxicity of vaccines may improve quality of life compared with
      chemotherapy or RT.

          -  Surgical resection of at least 0.5 grams of tumor

          -  Both newly diagnosed (with available pathological diagnosis) and recurrent patients
             can be eligible. Prior radiation therapy (RT) after the initial diagnosis will be
             allowed but there must be at least 6 months from the completion of RT (or
             radiosurgery) to signed informed consent.

          -  Prior chemotherapy and any systemic molecularly targeted anti-tumor therapy will be
             allowed.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥ 70%.

          -  Off or low dose (≤ 4 mg/day by Decadron) corticosteroid at least two weeks before the
             first pre-surgical vaccine

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration including: 1) Adequate
             bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil (segmented and bands) count (ANC) ≥1.0 x
             10^9/L, absolute lymphocytes ≥400/μL, platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L; hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL; 2)
             Hepatic: - Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN), and 3) Renal: Normal serum creatinine or creatinine
             clearance ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m^2

          -  Must be free of systemic infection. Subjects with active infections (whether or not
             they require antibiotic therapy) may be eligible after complete resolution of the
             infection. Subjects on antibiotic therapy must be off antibiotics for at least 7 days
             before beginning treatment.

          -  Sexually active females of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device [IUD],
             surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) for the duration
             of the vaccination period. Sexually active males must agree to use barrier
             contraceptive for the duration of the vaccination period.

          -  Patient must sign an informed consent document indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study, which includes an authorization for the release
             of their protected health information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of gliomatosis cerebri, cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease

          -  Presence of T1 Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions (on MRI) suggestive of high-grade
             glioma

          -  Pathological diagnosis for the resected tumor demonstrates transformation to higher
             grade (i.e. WHO grade III or IV) or gliomas. If a patient who received pre-surgical
             vaccines is diagnosed as high-grade glioma (HGG), the patient will be withdrawn from
             the study and considered for therapeutic options for HGG (trials for HGG or standard
             of care). The tumor tissue of such a case would be brought to the lab before the
             pathological diagnosis is made; and thus would be processed before the lab is informed
             of the final HGG diagnosis. Because HGG tissue may still reflect the vaccine effects,
             we will evaluate the tumor tissue to help us develop future approaches for HGG.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Pregnancy testing will be performed on
             all menstruating females within 14 days prior to study enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection (e.g. active or chronic hepatitis B and C), symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  History or current status of immune system abnormalities such as hyperimmunity (e.g.,
             autoimmune diseases) that needed to be treated by systemic therapy, such as
             immuno-suppressants and hypoimmunity (e.g., myelodysplastic disorders, marrow
             failures, AIDS, transplant immunosuppression).

          -  Receiving ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, or dexamethasone &gt; 4mg
