      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding emactuzumab to the combination
      of paclitaxel and bevacizumab can help to control relapsed or refractory ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The safety and side effects of this drug combination will
      also be studied.

      Part 1:

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join the study. Up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of
      the study, and up to 112 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      You are in Part 1, you will receive paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and emactuzumab to check for the
      highest tolerable dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 28 days.

      You will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, of each cycle. You
      will receive bevacizumab and emactuzumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Bevacizumab
      will be given over about 90 minutes the first time it is given. Doses after this will be
      given over a shorter time if no side effects are seen. Emactuzumab will be given over about
      30 minutes each time it is given on this study.

      If the disease gets worse and you agree, you will have a core biopsy, be taken off study, and
      offered other treatment options.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue receiving the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to check your, heart
           function, and for tumor marker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before and after the dose for
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures how much study drug is in the body at
           different time points.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have either a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before the dose for
      pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker testing. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in
      your body may affect the disease.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an EKG at any time during the study.

      End of Treatment:

      After you stop receiving the study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart
           function, and for tumor marker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have either a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PD testing.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days (+/- 5 days) after receiving your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and tumor marker testing.

      Information about your health status will continue to be collected from your medical record
      for up to 5 years after you leave the study.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and paclitaxel are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer. This drug combination is
      approved for the treatment of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube
      cancer. Emactuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. The addition of
      emactuzumab to the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel is investigational and is
      currently being used for research purposes only. The doctor can explain how the study drugs
      are designed to work.

      Up to 14 participants will have screening tests to learn if they are eligible to take part in
      this study. Up to 9 participants that are found to be eligible will be enrolled in Part 1 of
      this multicenter study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Up to 128 participants will have screening tests to learn if they are eligible to take part
      in this study. Up to 112 participants that are found to be eligible will be enrolled in Part
      2 of this study. Up to 74 will take part at MD Anderson.

      Part 2:

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join the study. Up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of
      the study, and up to 112 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      You are in Part 2.

      You will begin the study by receiving paclitaxel and bevacizumab for up to 8 weeks. After
      that, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study arms.

        -  If you are in Arm 1, you will receive paclitaxel and bevacizumab.

        -  If you are in Arm 2, you will receive paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and emactuzumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 28 days.

      You will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for up to 2
      cycles and you will receive bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 for up to 2 cycles. This
      will be called Part 2A. The status of the disease will then be checked.

      If the disease gets worse and you agree, you will have a core biopsy, be taken off study, and
      offered other treatment options. If the disease improves, you will continue to receive the
      same treatment as in Part 2A and will not continue onto Part 2B. If the disease is stable,
      you will have a core biopsy and continue onto Part 2B.

        -  If you are in Arm 1 of Part 2B, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days
           1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle and you will receive bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15
           of each cycle.

        -  If you are in Arm 2 of Part 2B, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days
           1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle and you will receive bevacizumab and emactuzumab by vein
           on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue receiving the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      If you are in Part 2A, on Day 22 of Cycle 2, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before
      the dose for PD testing.

      If you are in Part 2B, on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn
      before the dose for PD testing.

         25. Family history of long QT syndrome or other risk factors for torsades de pointes,
             and/or the use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval.

         26. Signs or symptoms of serious active infection requiring oral or i.v. antibiotics
             within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and/or hospitalization at study entry including,
             but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, active
             tuberculosis or severe pneumonia..

         28. For women who are not postmenopausal (&lt;12 months of non therapy-induced amenorrhea,
             with no identified cause other than menopause) and have not undergone surgical
             sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent
             (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use two adequate non hormonal methods of
             contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year,
             during the treatment period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study
