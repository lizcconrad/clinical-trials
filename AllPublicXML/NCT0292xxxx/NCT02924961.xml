  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the fixed bearing (FB) Triathlon knee (Stryker, USA) and
      the mobile bearing (MB) Triathlon knee (Stryker, USA) and study the effect of implant design
      on kinematics and micromotion. During two tasks the kinematics measured with fluoroscopy
      (kinematics and movement of the polyethylene bearing). Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric
      Analysis (RSA) will be used to evaluate micromotion between prosthesis and the bone for the
      MB and FB Triathlon knee.

      The goal of this study is to perform a kinematic evaluation of a MB and FB knee prosthesis
      designs (Triathlon, Stryker, USA), by means of fluoroscopy and RSA and compare the different
      designs. The findings of this study will contribute to improve total knee designs and improve
      rehabilitation strategies.

      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate if there is micromotion of the prosthesis with respect to the bone and if
           there is a different migration pattern between the designs.

        2. To assess and compare the in vivo kinematic patterns of the knee designs by means of
           fluoroscopy. This will be done on a subset of the patients (the first 20 patients able
           to perform step-up and lunge motions 6 months post-operatively in a controlled manner
           without the use of bars and walk more than 1 km)

        3. To evaluate if the polyethylene bearing in the mobile bearing is rotating and if this
           changes over time.

        4. Results of the RSA study will be used to correlate the kinematic parameters
           (fluoroscopy) with the migration results in order to identify factors of risk for the
           survival of total knee prostheses.

    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>
