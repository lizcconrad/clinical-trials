  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how the brain allows individuals to keep
      information &quot;in mind&quot; over brief intervals. During the experiment, participants will be asked
      to maintain fixation while they attend to and remember different visual stimuli (e.g., the
      location of a dot on the screen, the color of a circle, the orientation of a line, the speed
      of a group of moving dots) on a computer monitor. Participants will make decisions about
      these visual stimuli and indicate their decisions by pressing buttons or making eye
      movements. Through the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) investigators hope to
      understand the contributions of different anatomical areas while subjects perform this task.

      This study will use a within subject design in which each participant will perform a working
      memory task combined with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. TMS will be applied in three
      possible procedures, 1) Online TMS, 2) Offline TMS and 3) Sham TMS. All subjects will be
      given two trials within their one session, one of which will be sham TMS for all subjects and
      another of which will be randomly assigned to either Online or Offline TMS. Trials order will
      be randomly counterbalanced across subjects, who will be blind to the treatment of frontal
      vs. sham TMS (independent variable). Participants will be randomized into either the online
      or offline groups by computer generated lists to ensure equal numbers of participants in each
      condition. Half of the subjects will receive online TMS (online group) and half will receive
      offline TMS (offline group). Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The
      dependent variables will be performance accuracy and reaction time on the working memory
      task. By utilizing online and offline TMS, investigators will be able to explore whether
      frontal cortex is involved transiently in visual working memory or persistently throughout
      the task.

    <intervention_name>Sham TMS condition</intervention_name>
    <description>A sham TMS coil will be used to measure baseline performance on the working memory task. The sham coil looks and sounds just like the real coil, but produces a negligible magnetic field. Following the 40 seconds of sham TBS, the subject will perform the working memory task for 45 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>OffLine TMS Condition</intervention_name>
    <description>A total of 200 trains will be delivered successively in 40 s, totaling 600 pulses. The pulses will be delivered at 80% of motor thresholds. A sham TMS coil will be used to measure baseline performance on the working memory task. The sham coil looks and sounds just like the real coil, but produces a negligible magnetic field. Following the 40 seconds of TBS, or sham TBS, the subject will perform the working memory task for 45 minutes.</description>

    <description>A single train of pulses (3 pulses at 50Hz, duration 40ms) will be delivered once during a particular time epoch on each trial, followed by a minimum of 6 seconds of no stimulation. No more than 600 pulses will be applied in a single session. Similar to the offline TMS condition, a sham TMS coil will be used to measure baseline performance on the working memory task. In each session (frontal, sham) subjects will perform the working memory task for 45 minutes.</description>
