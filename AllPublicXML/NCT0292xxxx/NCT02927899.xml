    <textblock>
      This study is a sensory analysis of several different formulations of a novel
      tomato-soy-arugula seed beverage in men with prostate cancer. Eating a diet rich in a variety
      of fruits and vegetables has been associated with decreased risk of a variety of diseases,
      including prostate cancer. Mixed vegetable beverages may be useful in prostate cancer
      survivorship.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the sensory acceptability of a novel tomato-soy-arugula seed beverage in men
      with prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 4 tomato-soy beverages and 3 labeled arugula seed powder portions. Patients
      add 1 arugula seed powder portion to each of 3 tomato-soy beverages immediately prior to
      consumption and they consume 1 beverage without the powder. After each beverage tasting,
      patients complete a survey on the sensory acceptability of the sample.

    <description>Mean plus/minus standard deviation will be used to express the results from the acceptability tests and the Just About Right tests. Ranking results will be analyzed by using t-test to obtain determine statistical significance. Significance level of the value will be chosen before statistic tests are conducted, at a value of 5%. A critical value below p &lt; 0.05, will be considered statistically significant.</description>
