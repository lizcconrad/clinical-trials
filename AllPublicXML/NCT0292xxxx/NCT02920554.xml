      The extent of hepatic resection for gallbladder cancer can be done from a wedge resection to
      4b/5 bisegmentectomy. This study aims to compare the recurrence rates and survival rates
      between wedge resection group and bisegmentectomy group. Patients with T2 or T3 gallbladder
      cancer on preoperative CT exam or patients who were pathologically diagnosed as T2 or T3
      gallbladder cancer after initial simple cholecystectomy were enrolled. All patients are
      randomly assigned to wedge resection or bisegmentectomy group. Number of patients in each
      group is 44. Primary endpoint is recurrence-free-survival rates and overall survival rates.

      The extent of hepatic resection for gallbladder cancer has a wide range. A partial
      hepatectomy involving the gallbladder fossa is a critical part of the resection but can range
      from a wedge resection to an anatomic resection of segments 4b and 5 to an extended right
      hepatectomy. This study enrolls Patients with T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer on preoperative CT
      exam or patients who were pathologically diagnosed as T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer after
      initial simple cholecystectomy. Eighty eight patients are randomized to wedge resection group
      or bisegmentectomy group. Except the extent of hepatic resection, all the procedures
      including hepatoduodenal,common hepatic, posterior pancreatic lymph node dissection are same.

      Primary endpoint is recurrence-free-survival rates and overall survival rates.
