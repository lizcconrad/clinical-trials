  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate comprehensively the effect of riboflavin
      supplementation on the abundance of F. prausnitzii and on other members of the gut microbiota
      in faeces of healthy volunteers. Additionally it will be assessed whether riboflavin
      supplementation affects the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as adherent
      invasive E. coli (AIEC). Finally, the effect of riboflavin supplementation on the production
      of Short Chain Fatty Acids, the release of gut hormones and potential changes in glucose
      homeostasis and appetite perception will be assessed.

             inclusion

          -  Participant has had exposure to any non-registered drug product within 30 days prior
             to the screening visit

          -  Recent history of (within 12 months of screening visit) or strong potential for
             alcohol or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as &gt;60g (men) / 40g (women) pure
