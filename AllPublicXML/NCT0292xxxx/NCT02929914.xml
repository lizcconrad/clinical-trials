    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the clinical effect of photodynamic therapy
      (PDT)using LED on dentin with carious lesions in permanent teeth. Patients with molars
      exhibiting deep carious lesions on the occlusal surface indicated for restorative treatment
      will be randomly allocated to two groups: Group 1 -Control after incomplete caries
      removal,indirect pulp treatment with calcium hydroxide(CH); Group 2 - PDT + CH after
      incomplete caries removal,disinfect the residual dentin with PDT(LED + methylene),then
      indirect pulp treatment with CH. Dentin samples will be removed before and after PDT for
      microbiological analysis. The microbiological samples will be cultured in Brucella blood
      agar, Mitis Salivarius-bacitracin agar and Rogosa Selective Lactobacillus agar. The teeth
      will then be restored using resin with clinical and radiographic follow up at six, 12 and 24
      months. The data will be submitted to descriptive statistics.

    <description>Partial carious tissue was removed with conventional dentinal curette and collection of dentin with a spoon (1#) was performed. The remaining dentin was washed with sodium 0.9% saline. After that a a new dentin collection was performed at another site of the cavity, and teeth were conventionally restored using the following materials: calcium hydroxide lining material and resin(Z350,3M)</description>

    <description>Partial carious tissue was removed with conventional dentine curette and collection of dentin with a spoon (1#) was performed. The remaining dentin was washed with 200 µL of O-Toluidine blue dye (0.1 mg/mL) for 60 s. After this, a red LED light source with wavelength of 630 nm was used at 100 mW（medium Wave） power, 9.0 J of energy, for 60 s with energy density of 30.0 J/cm2 . A new dentin collection was performed after this treatment at another site of the cavity.Then teeth were conventionally restored using the following materials: calcium hydroxide lining material and resin(Z350,3M)</description>
