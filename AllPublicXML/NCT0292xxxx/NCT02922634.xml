  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine whether identifying patients with baseline
      cognitive deficits through preoperative cognitive screening may aid patient, family, and
      surgeon decision-making; inform and potentially improve anesthetic management and improve
      patient safety by identifying risk for postoperative morbidity.

      Aim 1. Assess the marginal benefit of structured preoperative cognitive screening relative to
      standard or systematic preoperative evaluation for identifying seniors with likely cognitive
      impairment.

      Aim 2. Determine whether preoperative cognitive impairment predicts postoperative outcome.

      This project is designed as a prospective, single-center observational study. The cohort will
      consist of 500 consenting subjects ≥ 65 years of age who present to the Brigham and Women's
      Hospital Weiner Center for Preoperative Evaluation (CPE) prior to elective thoracic surgery
      (specifically, thoracoscopic lung resection, lobectomy, thoracotomy, or esophagectomy) and to
      neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery by neurosurgeons Dr. Groff, Dr. Lu and Dr.
      Chi. 250 subjects undergoing thoracic surgery will be recruited and 250 subjects undergoing
      neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery will be recruited (500 total). These ages
      are chosen as significant clinical data demonstrate increased cognitive impairment in
      community dwelling elders. Eligibility criteria include: patients ≥ 65 years of age with an
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of I-III
      presenting for elective thoracic surgery or spinal surgery. Exclusion criteria will include
      planned Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission postoperatively, history of stroke or brain
      tumor, uncorrected vision or hearing impairment (unable to see pictures or read or hear
      instructions); limited use of the dominant hand (limited ability to draw); and or inability
      to speak, read, or understand English.

      Patients will be introduced to the study through a flyer provided to them in their surgeon's
      office. A study team member will speak with those favorably predisposed to participate to
      determine if they satisfy eligibility criteria. After obtaining consent, study staff will
      gain information about the patient's age and years of education. Study staff will administer
      standard instruments to assess social support (MOS Social Support Survey, a 12-item
      self-report questionnaire) in thoracic surgical patients. The Modified Brief Pain Inventory
      Short-Form (mBPI-sf) will be administered to spinal surgical patients. Health and functional
      status activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),
      respectively, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale [WHODAS]) will be
      administered to all surgical patients.The World Health Organization Disability Assessment
      Schedule 2.0 is an alternative to the 36-Item Rand Health Survey Short-Form (SF36) to measure
      physical health and disability. In addition, all patients will be asked if they've had a fall
      within the last 6 months, whether they've been evaluated for a change in memory or thinking,
      who accompanied them to their appointment, their employment status and their living situation
      (alone, institutionalized, living with family members) in a patient survey. The study staff
      will administer the MiniCog, a simple cognitive screening tool that takes just 2-4 min to
      complete and has little or no education, language, or race bias. In addition, the Animal
      Fluency test will be administered, which is a short cognitive screen that takes one minute to
      complete. Other measures of cognitive impairment will be obtained by study staff through:
      documentation on the patient's standard preoperative form, patient or informant report of
      diagnosis or evaluation for cognitive impairment or memory concerns, and systematic medical
      record review. Each enrolled patient will receive a business card listing the investigators'
      contact information and be advised to expect a follow up telephone up to 6 and 12 months
      after surgery to verify data elements and reassess functional outcome.

      Delirium will be assessed prospectively once per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 by a
      trained study team member using the Confusion Assessment Method [CAM]. For patients that are
      in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) postoperatively, the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU
      (CAM-ICU) will be administered prospectively twice per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3
      by a trained study team member (Attachment-CAM-ICU). Delirium is most common on postoperative
      days 1-3 and the CAM is a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical patients. For
      functional status, the WHODAS will be administered 6-12 months postoperatively either by
      personnel in the surgeon's office as part of routine follow up or by study staff or by
      telephone. We will also collect information on secondary outcomes including presence of an
      advanced directive, whether they had surgical procedure, time to postoperative anesthesia
      care unit (PACU) discharge, discharge to place other than home (rehabilitation, skilled
      nursing facility), hospital length of stay (LOS), in hospital complications, anesthetic
      dosages (including bispectral index (BIS) information), estimated blood loss, blood pressure,
      oxygen saturation, 30-day reoperation or readmission rate, and 30-day and 1-year mortality.
      These outcomes are recorded in the medical record, the BWH Balanced Scorecard, an electronic
      database of all hospitalized patients that tabulates 31 elements of the hospital event, or
      the Brigham and Women's Hospital BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query. Data will also
      be confirmed by a follow up telephone interview.
