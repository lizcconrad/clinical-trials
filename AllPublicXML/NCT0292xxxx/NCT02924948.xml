  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is an essential technique required in diagnosis of
      pancreatobiliary diseases. In previous studies, 6% of patients who undergone EUS had
      significant throat pain. (NRS scale 5 or greater) Although some endoscopists think balloon
      inflation while EUS insertion could result in decreased throat damage and pain, there is no
      data to back up. We designed a single center randomized pilot study to compare throat pain
      caused by EUS insertion with conventional vs balloon inflation method.

      All patients who are undergoing EUS with radial type echoendoscope will be asked for an
      informed consent. Subjects will be randomized to conventional insertion arm and balloon
      inflated insertion arm. All patients will be sedated according to SNUH endoscopy center
      protocol. Conventional insertion will be done in conventional insertion group, and balloon
      inflation before the start of procedure will be done in balloon inflated insertion arm. After
      the EUS procedure is finished, subject will be moved to a recovery room. As soon as the
      subject is recovered from sedation, throat pain will be assessed in NRS scale and be
      recoreded. Information of insertion failure and balloon damage during insertion will be also
      collected.
