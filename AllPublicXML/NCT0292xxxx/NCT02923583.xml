             of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptive,
             intrauterine device (IUD); bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy, additional barrier
             method [e.g., diaphragm, cap, sponge]).

               -  Contraception is not required for subjects who are abstinent (abstinence should
                  be their preferred and usual lifestyle; contraception should be used as described
                  if subjects stop being abstinent), subjects in exclusive same-sex relationships,
                  and post-menopausal females.

                    -  Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months, confirmed
                       by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 IU/L at screening in order
                       not to be considered of childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing and
                       contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy,
                       bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.
