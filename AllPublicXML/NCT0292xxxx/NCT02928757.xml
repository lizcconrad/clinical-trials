  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are ~6,200 children in Ontario with special and complex healthcare needs requiring
      multiple services from many different doctors and other healthcare providers. These children
      are at a high risk of missed, duplicated or inappropriate care, and extraordinary financial
      burden and stress on families. While small in number (&lt;1% of Ontario kids), these children
      use 1/3 of all child healthcare resources, and are known to desperately need coordinated care
      to optimize their health. Complex Care Kids Ontario (CCKO) brings together researchers,
      children and families, and healthcare providers from across Ontario to develop, implement and
      evaluate an evidence-based and coordinated model of care for every child with medical
      complexity in Ontario.

    <description>The CCKO intervention involves intensive care coordination, defined as: &quot;deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services. Organizing care involves marshaling of personnel and other resources needed to carry out all required patient care activities and is often managed by the exchange of information among participants responsible for different aspects of care&quot;. Within CCKO, intensive care coordination will specifically include: 1) the tailored, family/health care provider co-creation and regular updating of care coordination plans for each child which will be 2) facilitated and accounted for by key workers partnering with families.</description>
