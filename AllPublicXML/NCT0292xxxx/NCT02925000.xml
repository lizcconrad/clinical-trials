             advanced, refractory/relapsed or metastatic disease for which local curative surgery,
             curable radiotherapy, or satisfactory systemic anticancer therapy is no longer
             available

             weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) (for mycosis fungoides [MF] and Sezary syndrome [SS])
             criteria, or having measurable tumors defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors guidelines (RECIST 1.1) (for solid tumor)

          7. Poor vital organ function defined as:

                  to have at least 2 weeks free from blood transfusion, G-CSF and erythropoietin
                  use prior to the hematology test)

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) for coagulation above upper normal range

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or Alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt;3 times ULN
                  in patient without liver metastasis or liver cirrhosis

               -  Child Pugh B or C stage liver disease
