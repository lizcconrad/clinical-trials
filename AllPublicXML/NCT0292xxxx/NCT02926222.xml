  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the role of Regorafenib in prolonging the overall survival of
      glioblastoma multiforme patients who progressed after surgery and Stupp regimen with or
      without bevacizumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the overall survival (OS) in the intention to
      treat (ITT) population. Secondary aims are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS),
      safety, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) in the ITT population, and
      the evaluation of quality of life (QoL). Additional exploratory objectives include the
      analysis of antiangiogenic and metabolic biomarkers in tissue at first and second surgery (if
      performed) by the evaluation of certain metabolic features of tumors that could be involved
      in tumor responses to antiangiogenic drugs.
