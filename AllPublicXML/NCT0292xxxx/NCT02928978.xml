  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating how ruxolitinib affects premalignant breast cells. One half of the
      study participants will receive ruxolitinib for approximately 15 days, and the other half
      will receive a placebo (sugar pill) for approximately 15 days. Once study participants have
      completed their ruxolitinib or placebo, participants will undergo surgery to remove the
      premalignant breast tissue.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a breast biopsy showing ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia), ALH (atypical lobular
             hyperplasia), LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ), or DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ)
             requiring surgical excision.

               -  NOTE: Tissue from the diagnostic biopsy must be accessible/available for research
                  correlates (i.e., a tissue block or ~10 unstained slides). Due to the nature of
                  the study, fewer slides may be accepted with prior permission from the Protocol
                  Chair if there is insufficient tissue.

          -  Women and men age 18 and older.

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function, defined as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet levels &gt;200 x 109/L

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x institutional ULN

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockroft-Gault method

          -  Willing to not use concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as this could interfere with
             the metabolism of ruxolitinib (i.e azole antifungals, clarithromycin, conivaptan,
             grapefruit juice, mibefradil, nefazodone, protease inhibitors, telithromycin).

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting
             therapy. The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because class C agents are potentially teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of
             enrollment.

          -  Participants with current or previous history of invasive breast cancer.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ruxolitinib. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy when indicated.

          -  Prior or current treatment with a JAK inhibitor, for any indication.

          -  Known Hepatitis B or C participants
