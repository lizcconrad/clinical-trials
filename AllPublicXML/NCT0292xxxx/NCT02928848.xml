  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present sham-controlled study, the investigators examine whether tDCS could be used to
      enhance language abilities (e.g., picture naming) in individuals with PPA variants primarily
      characterized by difficulties with speech production (non-fluent and logopenic).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by insidious
      irreversible loss of language abilities. Prior studies suggest that transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) directed toward language areas of the brain may help to ameliorate
      symptoms of PPA. In the current study, the investigators are examining whether tDCS could be
      used to enhance language abilities (e.g., picture naming) in individuals with PPA variants
      primarily characterized by difficulties with speech production (non-fluent and logopenic).
      Participants are being recruited from the Penn Frontotemporal Dementia Center to receive 10
      days of both real and sham tDCS (counter-balanced, full-crossover design; participants are
      na√Øve to stimulation condition). A battery of language tests are being administered at
      baseline, immediately post-tDCS (real and sham), and six weeks and twelve weeks following
      stimulation. Real tDCS may improve language performance in some individuals with PPA.
      Specifically, the investigators expect that tDCS will be more effective in people whose
      baseline performance is worse based on previous research. Severity of deficits at baseline
      may be an important factor in predicting which patients will respond positively to
      language-targeted tDCS therapies.

    <description>A battery of language tests was administered at baseline, immediately post-tDCS (real and sham) following the termination of the tDCS session on the same day. Each test within this battery is scored for performance accuracy. The different tests assess different domains of language function, and have different numbers of items. In order to assess global language performance across different domains of language ability, a single composite score will be computed for each participant at each time-point by z-transforming the data from each test to facilitate comparisons across tests with different measurement scales, and averaging the z-scores to create a single composite z-score that captures language performance in general. Difference scores will be computed from these z-scores to assess change in performance at the post-stimulation timepoint relative to the most recent baseline to compare the relative impact of real vs. sham tDCS on global language performance.</description>

    <description>A battery of language tests was administered at baseline and six weeks following stimulation. Each test within this battery is scored for performance accuracy. The different tests assess different domains of language function, and have different numbers of items. In order to assess global language performance across different domains of language ability and over time, a single composite score will be computed for each participant at each time-point by z-transforming the data from each test to facilitate comparisons across tests with different measurement scales, and averaging the z-scores to create a single composite z-score that captures language performance. Difference scores will be computed from these z-scores to assess change in performance at the six-week timepoint relative to the most recent baseline to compare the relative impact of real vs. sham tDCS on global language performance.</description>
