      Currently, partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered as the gold standard treatment modality for
      small renal masses. In this setting, robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic approaches
      are gaining more consensus every day. However, until now, no superiority of one technique
      over the other has yet been demonstrated, especially on postoperative function recovery.

      This study compares oncological and functional outcomes after laparoscopic partial
      nephrectomy versus robot assisted partial nephrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 2-3% of all cancers, with the highest incidence in
      Western countries. Due to increased detection of tumors by ultrasound (US) and computed
      tomography (CT), the number of incidentally diagnosed RCCs has increased. These tumors are
      usually smaller and of lower stage. Currently, partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered as the
      gold standard treatment modality for small renal masses. In this setting, robot-assisted and
      conventional laparoscopic approaches are gaining more consensus every day. However, until
      now, no superiority of one technique over the other has yet been demonstrated, especially on
      postoperative function recovery. This is a single center prospective randomized trial
      investigating the functional and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive (laparoscopic and
      robot-assisted) nephron sparing surgery. Patients will be assessed with renal scintigraphy
      and 24 hours creatinine clearance pre- and postoperatively. Furthermore, duration of the
      operation, resection and suturing times will be assessed. Renal function recovery is defined
      as primary endpoint; oncological outcome and positive surgical margin rate are defined as
      secondary measures. In addition, kidney volume variation will be calculated to describe the
      amount of healthy tissue preserved in both procedures.The aim of the study is to assess
      whether robot assisted partial nephrectomy in selective ischemia is superior to laparoscopic
      partial nephrectomy in global ischemia in terms of functional and oncological outcomes.

    <description>The renal hilus is identified and both vein and artery are dissected. A laparoscopic ultrasound probe is introduced through a 12 mm port to define the tumor resection margins. A laparoscopic Satinsky clamp is used to induce total kidney ischemia, clamping both vein and artery. Athermal resection of the tumor is performed and titanium clips are used to close interlobar or arcuate arteries encountered during resection. The defect is closed with stitches secured by Hem-o-Lok clips and haemostatic glue. Ischemia is interrupted once renorrhaphy is completed</description>

    <description>The renal hilus is carefully dissected, so that the arterial segmental branches are reached. Tumor resection margins are identified through ultrasound. Drop-in bulldog clamps are used to clamp segmental arterial branches and induce selective ischemia. Indocyanine green 0.2-0.3mg/KG is infused intravenously a few seconds after the selective ischemia is induced. The Firefly near infra-red fluorescence system is used to determine the extent of the ischemic area. The ischemic zone can now be tailored to the tumor by adding or removing bulldog clamps according to the vascular anatomical conditions. Athermal resection of the tumor is performed and titanium clips are used to close interlobar or arcuate arteries encountered during resection. The resection defect is closed with stitches secured by Hem-o-Lok clips and haemostatic glue. Selective ischemia will be interrupted once renorrhaphy is completed</description>
