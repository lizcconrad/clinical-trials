    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the clinical benefit and safety of
      treatment with enzalutamide in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy or as monotherapy
      versus placebo with paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic,
      diagnostic-positive, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

    <description>Best overall response is defined as the best tumor response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease, progressive disease, not evaluable) based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 over all tumor assessments performed any time on study. Best objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR for all patients based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1. The 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) will be reported for each treatment group using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

             estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), and 0 or 1+ by IHC for human
             epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or negative for gene amplification (average
             HER2 copy number &lt; 4 signals/cell; HER2:CEP17 ratio &lt; 2.0).

          -  Estrogens, including hormone replacement therapy

          -  Androgens (eg, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone)

          -  Systemic radionuclides (eg, samarium, strontium)

          -  Had major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization.

          -  Has a history of another invasive cancer within 3 years before randomization, with the
             exception of fully treated cancers with a remote probability of recurrence.

          -  Has a history of a seizure condition or any condition that may predispose to seizure
             (eg, prior cortical stroke or significant brain trauma).

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to any of the enzalutamide/placebo capsule components.

          -  Had a hypersensitivity reaction to Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) or a
             drug formulated in Cremophor EL, such as paclitaxel, unless successfully treated and
