  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over
      prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean
      delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given
      opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other
      developed countries. The investigators believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is
      superior to current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a
      decrease in the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients'
      recovery and bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden
      of opioid abuse in the US. The objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain
      regimen in pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo
      controlled trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of intravenous
      (IV) acetaminophen (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin
      incision, and a dose of intramuscular (IM) ketorolac at time of fascia closure. These study
      medications are currently used in the patient population but not in a standardized fashion,
      not in every patient, and not always in combination with each other. The control group will
      receive placebo IV infusion preoperatively and an IM injection at fascia closure, and
      subcutaneous infiltration with normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive
      spinal regional anesthesia as per anesthesia team. Post-operatively, both groups will receive
      the current standard of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and
      ibuprofen as needed depending on pain score. The primary outcome of interest will be the
      total opioid intake in the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to
      first opioid requested, pain scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of
      opioid tablets left after discharge on post op day number 7. Additional outcomes include
      patient satisfaction scores and total length of hospital stay. The hypothesis is that our
      multimodal pain regimen will decrease the total opioid requirement in the first 48 hours
      after surgery.
