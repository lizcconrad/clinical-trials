    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and tolerability of S 55746 in
      patients with CLL, B-Cell NHL and MM, in terms of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) through safety profile
      (DLT, MTD), PK profile, PD profile and preliminary efficacy.
