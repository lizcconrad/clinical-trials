  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoid osteomas are painful, benign bone tumors that occur most frequently in young males
      between ages 10 and 20 years. The goal of the proposed study is based on the premise that
      MRgFUS is noninferior to CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (CTgRFA), in terms of pain
      reduction following treatment of osteoid osteomas, and offers possible improvements with
      regards to 1) post-procedural pain, 2) clinical resource utilization, 3) patient experience,
      and/or 4) adverse events. The data from the current study would provide clinicians important
      information in deciding between treatment options for ablation of osteoid osteomas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ages â‰¥ 10 years old.

          2. Diagnosis of osteoid osteoma as confirmed when a musculoskeletal radiologist and
             orthopedic oncologist agree that a patient's imaging and clinical history are most
             compatible with the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. A patient referred by a clinician
             other than orthopedic oncologist will require a clinic visit with an orthopedic
             oncologist for study inclusion.

          3. Patients must have medically uncontrolled pain from an osteoid osteoma, as defined by
             pain, which, in the view of the referring orthopedic oncologist significantly
             interferes with that patient's activities of daily living. Pain may be refractory to
             management with medications because of inadequate pain control, or because of side
             effects of the pain medication.

          4. If patients have an additional site of pain, it must be 2 points less severe and
             distinguishable from the pain at the osteoid osteoma site.

          5. Patients (or guardians/parents) who are able and willing to give consent (or assent
             where applicable) and able to attend all study visits.

          6. No prior interventional therapy for the osteoid osteoma.

          7. Able to safely undergo MRI exam, tolerate being in an MRI scanner, and receive
             anesthesia/sedation for the treatment.

          8. Targeted bone/tumor interface is accessible to the ExAblate device and located in a
             rib, extremity (excluding intra-articular location), pelvis, shoulders (including
             clavicles), or the sternum.

          9. Targeted lesion must be deeper than 1 cm from the skin.

         10. Targeted lesion must be clearly visible by non-contrast MRI.

         11. Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients a) who need surgical stabilization of the affected bone (elevated fracture
             risk) or b) whose targeted tumor is at an impending fracture site, as determined by
             the referring orthopedic oncologist.

          2. Targeted tumor in the skull/spine.

          3. Targeted tumor is &lt; 1 cm from a major nerve.

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. Patients with an acute medical condition (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis) that is expected to
             hinder them from completing this study.

          6. Patients with unstable cardiac status including: patients on anti-arrhythmic drugs,
             unstable angina pectoris, documented myocardial infarction within six months of
             protocol entry, congestive heart failure requiring medication (other than diuretic).

          7. Severe hypertension (diastolic BP &gt; 100 on medication)

          8. Patients with standard contraindications for MR imaging such as non-MRI compatible
             implanted metallic devices.

          9. Patients with an active infection or severe hematological, neurological, or other
             uncontrolled disease.

         10. Severe cerebrovascular disease.

         11. Known intolerance or allergy to medications used for sedation/anesthesia.

         12. Known intolerance or allergy to MR contrast agent (gadolinium chelates).

         13. Patients unable to communicate with the investigator and staff.

         14. Patients with persistent pain undistinguishable from the target lesion.
