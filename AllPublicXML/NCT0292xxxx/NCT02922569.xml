  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess
      the safety and efficacy of an experimental software program designed to improve cognitive
      functions versus a computer-based software control. Both the study and the software being
      investigated meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk. The primary objective of this study
      is to evaluate the effects of combination of mindfulness training (MT) and adaptive cognitive
      training (CT) on the cognitive abilities, functional status and quality of life of soldiers
      and veterans diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI, also referred to as a concussion, or
      blast exposure), as compared to a computer-based control.
