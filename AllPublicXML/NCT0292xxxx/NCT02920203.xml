  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to better identify hereditary cardiac causes of sudden unexpected
      death in young subjects through Next-Generation Sequencing of autopsy tissue
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring :

      For index cases group, all the data will be monitored. For the relatives group, only the
      informed consent will be monitored

      Statistical analysis :

        -  Evaluate the additional elucidation rate of unexpected sudden death

        -  Evaluate causes obtained by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) ( in comparison with
           conventional autopsy (macroscopic and / or microscopic)

        -  Descriptive study of the causes of sudden unexpected death, identified hereditary
           cardiac causes percentages compared via various diagnostic approaches

        -  Cost-effectiveness analysis

      Data Management :

      A database is created for the AGEMOS study with control of the discrepancies. All the index
      cases' data entered in the data base will be double checked

    <description>Aim is to determine if elucidation rate of unexpected sudden death causes obtained by high throughput sequencing (NGS) is significantly better than conventional autopsy (macroscopic and / or microscopic) alone.
Inclusion of a series of 100 consecutive and exhaustive cases (index cases) recruited by forensic institutes or pathology departements.
Determine the rate of sudden death elucidation after NGS (after targeted capturing of 100 genes responsible for inherited cardiac diseases, including cardiomyopathy and electrical diseases) and comparison of sudden death elucidation rate obtained with conventional autopsy (macroscopic and microscopic) by chi 2 analysis.</description>

Determination all the causes of death after conventional autopsy (unnatural, toxicological, non-cardiovascular, vascular, cardiological and coronary, cardiological and non-coronary causes such as cardiomyopathies &amp; myocarditis, no cause identified Descriptive analysis. All quantitative data will be analyzed with the average, standard deviation and median.

    <description>Aim is to determine the impact of systematic family cardiac screening in the understanding of sudden deaths Comparison of elucidation rates of cause of sudden death according to three methods:
i) identification of a hereditary heart disease via the systematic cardiac screening performed in relative; ii) by the conventional autopsy; iii) by sequencing NGS analysis; Statistics: test of McNemar (mated series). The threshold for level of statistical significance is chosen at 5 %.</description>
