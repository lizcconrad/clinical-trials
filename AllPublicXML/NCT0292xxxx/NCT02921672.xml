      Participants will be given instruction on following the study designed Mediterranean diet.
      Participation in the study will last about 9 weeks. Each person will be asked to follow the
      study diet for 6 weeks. During the study, participants will be asked to track the food they
      eat and will be monitored by a registered dietitian.
