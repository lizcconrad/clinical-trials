      This study will determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose if any and the recommended dose for
      phase 2 of monalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD94/NKG2A receptor, after
      allogenic stem cell transplantation. All patients will receive one single intravenous
      administration of one of the four doses of monalizumab.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is a curative option for most
      of hematological malignancies, though the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect mediated by immune
      cells from the donor. However, the use of Allo-HSCT is limited by its toxicity, notably the
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that is a major cause of non-relapse mortality (NRM).
      Conditioning regimens dramatically improved during the last fifteen years, with a decrease of
      both GVHD and NRM rates. Now, disease recurrence after Allo-HSCT is the first cause of
      treatment failure and remains a concern for approximately 30% of the patients.

      Based on a safety immunologic platform (ATG based reduced toxicity conditioning regimens), it
      is needed to develop post Allo-HSCT strategies to decrease the incidence of relapse. In this
      context, the modulation of immune cell activity could play a role to prevent relapse. NK
      cells have a unique capacity to exert potent GVT effects without inducing GVHD. Moreover, NK
      cells recovery occurs early after Allo-HSCT and NK cells function are not severely impaired
      by the use of ciclosporin A, that is given for few months after Allo-HSCT as GVHD
      prophylaxis. Thus, NK cell modulation appears as a viable option for early immune
      intervention after Allo-HSCT.

      Monalizumab (IPH2201), a monoclonal antibody has a non-depleting and purely blocking activity
      directed with high affinity and specificity against the CD94/NKG2A receptor expressed by
      subsets of NK cells, activated αβ CD8+ T cells, γδ-T cells and NK T cells. By suppressing the
      inhibitory signal transduced by NKG2A, IPH2201 enhances the anti-tumor functions, including
      cytolytic activity of these immune effector cells.The aim of the study is to determine the
      safety of IPH2201 after allogenic stem cell transplantation.
