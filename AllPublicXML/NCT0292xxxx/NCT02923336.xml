  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of non betablockers in
      gastrointestinal motility (transit time) in patients with liver cirrhosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that cirrhotic patients have increased gastrointestinal transit time,
      this issue may favor bacterial owergrowth, and consequently bacterial translocation.
      Translocation of bacterias and its products are linked to vascular and hemodynamics
      alterations that produce descompensation on the disease. There is evidence , in animal models
      , that the use of beta blockers favors the gastrointestinal movement; decompensated
      cirrhotics had significantly longer small bowel transit time as compared with compensated
      cirrhotics, there have described that this alteration is related to de cirrhosis severity as
      assessed by Child Pugh score. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the gastrointestinal
      transit time before and after treatment of non selective betablockers, we are going to
      evaluate the gastrointestinal time before and after of 4 weeks of non selectivebetablocker
      treatment, in decompensated cirrhotics. The gastrointestinal time is going to be evaluate by
      the ingestion of a device known as &quot;smart pill&quot;, that allow ambulatory monitoring of
      gastrointestinal transit.

    <description>the patient is going to receive a device called &quot;smart pill&quot; before the beginning of treatment with propranolol, after the evaluation with the smart pill device, they are goning to take propranolol (dose of propranolol 80 mg per day) for 4 weeks,finally they will receive another smart pill to evaluate the second gastrointestinal transit time</description>
