  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter randomized trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intravitreal
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents for the treatment of diabetic
      macular edema. The results are generally good in the short term, with approximately 75% of
      patients maintaining or improving vision after initiation of treatment. Despite this
      favorable outcome, the observation of persistent fluid is not infrequent during treatment,
      even in patients undergoing monthly treatment sessions. Persistent fluid was observed on
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 70.9% of patients receiving bevacizumab monthly and in
      79% of those receiving bevacizumab as needed at the end of the first year in the Comparison
      of diabetic macular edema. Treatment Trials. It is possible that resolution of this fluid,
      especially when it is centrally located (i.e., foveal), might result in better visual
      outcomes.

      A drug with higher VEGF-binding affinity may help patients with persistent fluid despite
      treatment with bevacizumab. Aflibercept is a new intravitreal VEGF antagonist approved on 28
      November 2014 by the Health Canada for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.

      In contrast to the antibody-based VEGF binding strategy used by bevacizumab, aflibercept
      incorporates the second binding domain of the VEGFR-1 receptor and the third domain of the
      VEGFR-2 receptor. By fusing these extracellular protein sequences to the Fc segment of a
      human IgG backbone, developers have created a chimeric protein with a very high VEGF binding
      affinity. Aflibercept binds all isomers of the VEGF-A family like bevacizumab, but it also
      binds VEGF-B and placental growth factors 1 and 2,1,2 which have been both implicated in the
      pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and of age-related macular degeneration. In addition,
      because of the increased trough binding activity and the stronger binding affinity,
      aflibercept should be efficacious in neutralizing VEGF more effectively and for longer
      duration.

      In this study patients recruitment, clinical care and follow-up will be conducted by:

      Dr Flavio Rezende: Principal-Investigator and Dr Radwan Ajlan: Co-Investigator.

        1. Purpose: To evaluate the visual acuity outcomes and macular changes at 6 and 12 months
           of intravitreal aflibercept (2.0 mg) in eyes with persistent center involved diabetic
           macular edema despite intravitreal bevacizumab therapy.

        2. Overall Goal of Study: The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of aflibercept
           on macular edema in patients with diabetic macular edema resistant to bevacizumab.

        3. Specific objectives: To evaluate the visual acuity outcomes and macular changes after 6
           and 12 months of intravitreal aflibercept (2.0 mg) in eyes with persistent foveal fluid
           secondary to diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold standard therapy with
           intravitreal bevacizumab. More specifically, to assess:

             -  Mean change in central subfield thickness (CST) from baseline, 6 month after
                switching to aflibercept.

             -  Mean change in CST from baseline, 12 months after switching to aflibercept.

             -  Mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline, 6 months after
                switching to aflibercept.

             -  Mean change in BCVA from baseline, 12 months after switching to aflibercept

        4. Study Design: Phase 4 open label clinical trial. Intravitreal injection of 0.05 mL (2mg)
           of aflibercept will be injected. The intravitreal between the first 5 treatments
           sessions is 4 weeks, and the intravitreal for the following treatment sessions up to
           week 52 is 8 weeks.

        5. Subjects: 40 patients seen in the retinal clinic of the Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont
           with foveal fluid secondary to diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold
           standard therapy with intravitreal bevacizumab will be assessed for eligibility.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eyes to be included in the series must have had at least six consecutive monthly
             intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and
             presented tomographic signals suggestive of foveal fluid on spectral-domain optical
             coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 4 weeks after the last treatment session. The interval
             between each of the last 3 consecutive bevacizumab treatments and the interval between
             the last bevacizumab and the SD-OCT imaging not exceeding 37 days.

          -  Persistent foveal fluid is defined as the observation of hypo-reflective spaces on OCT
             at the fovea (fovea centralis), which measures approximately 1.5 mm (1500 μm) or one
             disc diameter in size centered at the macular umbo. Tomographic changes will be
             measured by SD-OCT using the macular thickness maps.

          -  BCVA must be better than 20/800. Only 1 eye from each patient will be included in the
             study. If both eyes are affected, the better seeing eye will be included, since no
             previous meaningful difference was found in patients with 20/40 or better when treated
             with bevacizumab or aflibercept.3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An ocular media opacity that might interfere with visual acuity, assessment of
             toxicity, or photographic fundus documentation of the macular area.

          -  A history of vitrectomy.

          -  Known coagulation abnormalities, stroke, or recurrent use of anticoagulative
             medication other than aspirin.

          -  Pregnancy, or planning for pregnancy during the study time frame or the following 3
             months.

          -  Patients actively undergoing other ocular treatment options such as topical
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, topical steroids, or intravitreal
             steroids injections will be excluded from the study.
