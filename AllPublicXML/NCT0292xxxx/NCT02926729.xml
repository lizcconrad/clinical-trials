  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is studying a new investigative imaging instrument called a nonlinear
      microscope (NLM). A nonlinear microscope can produce images similar to an ordinary
      pathologist's microscope, but without first processing tissue to make slides. This study will
      determine if a NLM can be used to evaluate tissue during lumpectomy surgery for breast cancer
      in order to reduce the probability that standard pathologic examination of the specimen after
      the end of the operation will find close or positive margins, thus possibly requiring the
      patient to have additional breast surgery.

      The purpose of this research study is to improve the treatment of breast cancer and reduce
      the number of patients who require repeat surgical procedures to completely remove breast
      malignancy.

      In standard procedures, pathologists evaluate tissue samples on a microscope after the
      surgery is over. The new investigative imaging instrument is an advanced type of microscope
      that enables evaluation during surgery.

      The microscope will not be used directly on the participant or in the operating room, but
      instead will be used to image tissue immediately after excision but prior to the conclusion
      of surgery. If pathologic examination using NLM concludes that there is invasive cancer or
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at or close to the margin of the specimen, the surgeon will
      be notified and may decide to do additional surgical shavings before the patient leaves the
      operating room, in order to improve the likelihood of achieving clean margins and reduce the
      probability that the patient will be advised to have another operation to achieve clean
      margins. For both patients on the experimental arm (NLM) and the control arm (without NLM),
      standard pathologic evaluation of the specimen will be done some days after the lumpectomy is
      completed. That pathologic evaluation will decide whether or not to recommend that the
      patient has additional surgery in order to achieve clean margins. The primary outcome measure
      is the percentage of patients in each group who are advised to have additional surgery for
      this reason.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient scheduled to undergo lumpectomy for breast cancer at BIDMC.

          -  Core needle biopsy revealing invasive breast cancer or DCIS.

          -  Female.

          -  Minimum age of 21 years.

          -  Eligible for breast conserving surgery, lumpectomy and radiation.

          -  Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) on core needle biopsy, or if estrogen receptor
             negative (ER-), have evaluable estrogen receptor status with positive internal control
             on core biopsy.

          -  Progesterone receptor positive (PR+) on core needle biopsy if biopsy indicates
             invasive cancer, or if progesterone receptor negative (PR-) on biopsy indicating
             invasive cancer, have evaluable progesterone receptor status with positive internal
             control on core biopsy.

          -  HER2 IHC and/or FISH performed on core biopsy, if biopsy indicates invasive
             cancer.Oncotype DX or other DNA testing performed on core biopsy or not requested.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindicated for radiation therapy.

          -  Patients that have large areas DCIS as indicated on radiology, which would require

          -  No or equivocal ER, PR or HER2 testing performed prior to surgery if biopsy indicates
