  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High fidelity simulation provide educational skills but the simulation of critical events
      could eventually provide anxiety among participants.

      The anxiety could raise before the simulation session and affect the perceived quality of
      sleep the night prior to the simulation session. The lack of sleep would eventually affect
      both participation and memorization during the simulation session. The investigators would
      like to investigate with a survey how much participants had their sleep affected before the
      simulation session.
