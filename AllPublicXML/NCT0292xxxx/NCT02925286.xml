      There is a considerable knowledge-gap regarding the efficacy of problem gambling prevention
      in workplace settings. At the same time, this knowledge is widely requested upon both by
      researchers and government agencies. The evaluation of prevention programs is important both
      in a public health perspective and for the organizations investing in preventive
      interventions for problem gambling at the workspaces and the current study aims to contribute
      with knowledge regarding the potential effects of such an intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a workplace prevention program
      regarding problematic gambling, on a variety of outcomes. The authors hypothesize that the
      program will lead to differences in:

        -  A change in gambling habits among coworkers and managers

        -  That fewer workers and managers will report problem gambling

        -  That the managers who participate in the intervention will report being more confident
           in handling gambling and problem gambling at the workplace

        -  That the managers who participate in the intervention will report a higher inclination
           to engage in a conversation with an employee when suspicion or worry about problem
           gambling arises

        -  That the number of actions to help employees with problem gambling or other types of
           harmful use will raise among organizations who participate in the intervention.

        -  An increase in the employees' knowledge about what kind of support regarding gambling or
           addiction is available from the workplace and where to find it.
