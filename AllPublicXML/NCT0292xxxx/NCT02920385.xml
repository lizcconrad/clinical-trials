  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the influence of
      oral semaglutide on the pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of
      levothyroxine and the influence of co-administered tablets on the pharmacokinetics of
      semaglutide administered orally in healthy subjects.
