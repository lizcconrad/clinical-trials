  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteomyelitis is a risk factor for lower extremity amputation in diabetic people. Antibiotic
      therapy allows a remission in 60 to 80% of cases. However the optimal duration of antibiotic
      therapy remains controversy due to the absence of validated marker of osteomyelitis
      remission. We have previously shown that the negativity of white blood cell SPECT/CT (Single
      Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography) imaging at the end of treatment
      allowed to predict remission of osteomyelitis at 1 year in all cases. A positive imaging was
      associated with recurrence in 70% of cases. The aim of our study was to evaluate
      prospectively the interest of white blood cell SPECT/CT to set the duration of antibiotic
      therapy.
