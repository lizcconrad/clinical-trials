  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PostNAPs was a continuation of the PreNAPs study. 246 women were enrolled in the postnatal
      period with the primary scientific objective of determining whether food insecurity was an
      independent risk factor for poor maternal nutritional or psychosocial outcomes or for
      sub-optimal infant feeding practices.

    <description>Explore the underlying mechanisms and impacts of food insecurity (using the Individual Food Insecurity Access Scale (IFIAS)) on body composition changes (weight in kg, bioelectrical impedance analysis (among women), skin folds, MUAC), morbidity (malaria, diagnoses or symptoms of fever, typhoid, diarrhea, etc.), micronutrient status (hemoglobin), and other health indicators among women of mixed-HIV status and their infants in Gulu, Uganda.</description>
