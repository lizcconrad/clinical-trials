      This study evaluates the efficacy of Teens Against Tobacco Use anti-tobacco presentations on
      tobacco use susceptibility in 6th through 8th grade. Students will be randomly assigned to
      either receive 3 anti-tobacco presentations or 3 presentations on a different topic,
      unrelated to tobacco.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will collaborate with Austin High School, Wiggs Middle School, and Guillen
      Middle School of the El Paso Independent School District to implement smoke free youth
      coalitions as an after school activity. The coalitions will follow the Teens Against Tobacco
      Use (TATU) model developed by the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and
      the American Heart Association. Participating youth will be trained to develop and deliver
      anti-tobacco presentations to younger students. Each school will have a separate youth
      coalition operating under the guidance of an adult coordinator. High school youth will
      present to middle school classes, whereas middle school youth will present to 4th and 5th
      graders.

      To evaluate the efficacy of the TATU program, we will randomly assign students in physical
      education classes to receive TATU presentations or a control condition. Confidential surveys
      about tobacco will be administered at the beginning and end of the school year. Analyses will
      compare intervention and control students on smoking susceptibility, perceptions of harm from
      tobacco use, tobacco industry perceptions, and social norms on tobacco use.

    <description>Tobacco susceptibility captures the likelihood of using tobacco in the future. It will be assessed by likert scale questions drawn primarily from the global youth tobacco survey. It will be analyzed as a continuous variable that will be standardized, so outcomes will represent standard deviation unit differences in tobacco susceptibility.</description>
