  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive hemorrhage is a major cause of potentially preventable death following trauma. A
      common consequence of hemorrhagic shock is uncontrollable bleeding from coagulopathy, leading
      to death from exsanguination. Even when bleeding is controlled, patients are at increased
      risk of complications and mortality. Reconstituted whole blood, or component therapy with
      packed red blood cells (PRBCs), plasma, and platelets was introduced by the military in
      recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with remarkable results and has been adopted by most
      civilian trauma centers. Despite improving coagulopathy, it is apparent that transfusion of
      blood components is not equivalent to whole blood transfusion. Transfusion of high plasma
      volumes may be associated with increased risk of allergic reaction, transfusion associated
      acute lung injury (TRALI), hypervolemic cardiac failure, and acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS). Military services have recently reintroduced fresh whole blood (WB) for
      standard resuscitation of massive hemorrhage, have found that WB offers a survival advantage
      over component therapy, and that risks of transfusion reactions are similar for WB and PRBCs.
      On the civilian side, whole blood is an FDA-licensed product that has been in use in
      pediatric open heart surgery and autologous blood donation but is no longer commonly
      available for other indications. However, the military results are renewing interest in whole
      blood for trauma resuscitation. The use of low-antibody titer whole blood leukoreduced with a
      platelet-sparing filter was recently approved by the University of California Los Angeles
      Blood and Blood Derivatives Committee and two other trauma centers for male trauma patients.
      This study will test the feasibility of providing stored WB for resuscitation of patients in
      hemorrhagic shock and determine the effects of WB on clinical outcomes as well as the effects
      on coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation, compared to standard blood component therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most current massive transfusion protocols attempt to treat the early coagulopathic state
      induced by severe injury and hemorrhagic shock with transfusion of red blood cells, plasma,
      and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio replicating whole blood. Civilian trauma centers have now
      begun to initiate resuscitation of adult male patients with stored whole blood as a standard
      of care, however.

      The main hypothesis behind this change in practice is that transfusion of whole blood (WB)
      rather than attempted reconstitution from its banked components is safer, more efficient and
      effective treatment of hemorrhagic shock following injury and will result in less frequent
      development of clinical coagulopathy and subsequent mortality. Whole blood offers the
      advantages of more precisely approximating shed blood; decreased volume of additives per
      unit; and exposure to a decreased number of donors for a patient undergoing massive
      transfusion. It remains to be seen whether this will translate into differences in
      coagulopathy, inflammation, and mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of developing a system to collect, store, and deliver whole blood for trauma
      resuscitations in a civilian trauma center.

      The universal donor blood type for patients with unknown blood type is type O positive blood
      for males and O negative for females. Because O negative blood is rare the study will
      initiate the change in practice in adult male patients and later extend it to female patients
      if feasible. The study will determine the effects of WB transfusion in adult male patients
      compared to transfusion of PRBCS, plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio in non adult male
      patients on markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation, as well as the
      development of complications and hospital mortality following severe injury.

      Specific aims are to:

        1. Determine the appropriate shelf life of WB that has been leukoreduced with a platelet
           sparing filter by measuring changes in levels of coagulation factors and global clotting
           potential of banked units over time. To accomplish this the investigators will measure
           variables known to reflect potential and actual clotting capacity including platelet
           function and overall clotting ability by thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin
           generation analysis in whole blood up to 35 days.

        2. Prospectively determine the effectiveness of trauma resuscitation using WB compared to
           component therapy and its effects on variables known to reflect potential and actual
           clotting capacity including markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, platelet
           function and global hemostatic potential post transfusion, as well as hospital outcomes
           including development of coagulopathy, infection, venous thromboembolism (VTE), multiple
           organ failure (MOF), total transfusion requirements, and mortality.

        3. Test the feasibility and implementation of a system to provide WB for resuscitation of
           trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock in civilian trauma centers. This will be
           accomplished by monitoring cost, storage needs, frequency of blood collection, number of
           donors, inventory, utilization and wastage of unused units.
