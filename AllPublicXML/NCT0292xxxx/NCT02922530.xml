  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research proposal is to develop an adjunct to standard treatments
      that 'correct' disrupted neural circuitry in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Directly
      treating these core deficits via targeted behavioral training should slow the progression of
      PD, assure greater resilience against future decline, and improve the quality of life of many
      living with PD. The purpose of this exploratory research study is to determine the benefits,
      if any, of the mobile device-based treatment described above in individuals with PD.
