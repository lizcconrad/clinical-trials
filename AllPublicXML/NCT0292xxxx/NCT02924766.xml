    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of niraparib when
      administered in combination with an androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy (apalutamide or
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) in adult men with metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who may or may not have deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair anomalies.

    <description>Participants will receive initial starting dose of Niraparib 200 milligram (mg) once daily in combination either with Apalutamide 240 mg (4*60 mg) once daily or Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg (4*250 mg) plus 10 mg Prednisone (5 mg twice daily) for 28 days of cycle 1. Once a safe dose of niraparib is selected with each Andrgen Receptor (AR)-targeted therapy [Apalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone], then an expansion phase (Part 2) will open to further explore safety and assess antitumor activity.</description>
