  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals are to change the paradigm for development of mechanism targeted
      pharmacotherapy in neurodevelopmental disorders and provide a definitive test of the mGluR
      theory in humans by determining whether AFQ056, an mGluR5 negative modulator, can enhance
      neural plasticity in the form of language learning during an intensive language intervention
      in very young children with fragile X syndrome. This trial therefore will use an innovative
      but exploratory new trial design to develop a different way to examine efficacy of an agent
      with substantial support as a drug targeting CNS plasticity in preclinical models of a
      developmental disorder. If the design is successful, this trial can serve as a model for
      future trials of mechanistically-targeted treatments operating on neural plasticity in other
      neurodevelopmental disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will use a double blind placebo-controlled parallel-group flexible-dose forced
      titration design in which 100 subjects with FXS, age 32 months to 6 years of age will enter a
      12-month blinded treatment phase during which they are randomized 1:1 to AFQ056 or placebo
      followed by an 8-month (open label) extension phase in which all participants will be treated
      with active drug. The flexible dose design will mimic practice, take into account
      differential responsiveness and the known inter-child variability in drug levels with AFQ056,
      and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective.

    <measure>Language - Weighted Child Intentional Communication Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted Communication Score is coded from a 15 minute semi-structured examiner/child play session and reflects child initiated communication that involves the child's use of gestures, eye contact, vocalizations, and/or words and word combinations to communicate a message to a listener. The Weighted Communication Score coded from a standardized play session has been used in cohorts with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been able to measure change in language skills with age and change in language skills in response to an intervention. Goal is to demonstrate greater improvement in language learning in young children with FXS treated with AFQ056 in combination with an intensive standardized parent-implemented language intervention, relative to those treated with the language intervention and placebo, after 6 months of intervention, as a marker of drug effect on neural plasticity, the core problem in the disorder</description>

    <description>12 month treatment phase during which subjects are randomized to AFQ056. The initial dose of AFQ056 will be 25 mg BID. If the subject has no side effects the dose will be titrated (mandatory titration if no side effects) to the next level, 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID and 100 mg BID in order. A flexible dose design will mimic practice, and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective. The dose can be adjusted weekly through week 7. After 7 weeks the dose will be fixed, and at the 2 month visit all subjects will initiate the language intervention, remaining on a stable AFQ056/placebo dose for the next 6 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age 32 months to 6 years inclusive at Screening (visit 1).

          2. Has an FMR1 full mutation.

          3. DQ&lt;75 calculated from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at time of screening.

          4. Parent or legal guardian is available and able to communicate well with the
             investigator, comply with study requirements and provide written informed consent.

             **Note**The Parent or legal guardian who will be signing consent form, should be the
             individual administering the language intervention

          5. English is the primary language spoken in the home and the subject's first language is
             English.

          6. Meet criteria indicating evidence of intentional communication based on parent
             interview via a communication eligibility screening tool.

             **Note** On the Eligibility Screening Tool - Communication, the child must have at
             time of screening:

               1. Section 1: Answer of YES; the child uses at least 5 spoken words to label items
                  on a daily basis.

                  OR

               2. Section 2: At least 3 YES answers to items 1-10 if child does not have at least 5
                  spoken words.

          7. Produces 3 or more intentional acts of communication on the structured portion of the
             Weighted Communication play sample at time of screening.

          8. Stable behavioral and other therapy regimen for 30 days prior to screening.

          9. Stable dosing of all concurrent psychotropic medications except stimulants for at
             least 60 days prior to screening. Due to the very short half-life of stimulants
             (specifically methylphenidate and amphetamine variants), a stable regimen of these
             medications is required for 2 weeks only.

               -  Note** Medications impacting GABA, glutamate and/or mGluR5 pathway receptors are
                  exclusionary and not permitted during study participation. Additionally,
                  stimulant regimens may include combinations of short- and long-acting forms and
                  may be taken with different timing or dosing on different days of the week (e.g.
                  Doses may be skipped on weekends or days off school and extra doses may be given
                  some days for therapy sessions later in the day). The intent is to keep the doses
                  and regimen being used at the time of screening consistent during the trial even
                  if there is some variation in how the medication is taken on different days.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Use of medications impacting GABA, glutamate and/or mGluR5 pathway receptors or
             transmission.

             **Note** Treatment with acamprosate, amantadine, budipine, carbetocin, cycloserine,
             dextromethorphan, felbamate, ketamine, lithium, minocycline, memantine, oxytocin,
             remacemide, racemic baclofen, riluzole, fycampa, investigational mGluR5 medications,
             and/or statins are exclusionary.

          2. Unstable seizure disorder as defined by any seizure in the 6 months prior to the
             screening visit, and/or any change in anti-convulsant drug dosing in the 60 days prior
             to screening.

             **Note** Use of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine are among permitted anticonvulsants.

          3. Use of any other investigational drug at the time of enrollment or within 30 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) of the investigational drug prior to screening until
             end of study visits (or longer if required by local regulations).

          4. History of hypersensitivity to AFQ056 or any mGluR antagonist.

          5. History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class, within the past 2 years prior to screening including but not limited to
             neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic, renal, or gastrointestinal
             disorders. This does not include typical features of FXS such as psychological
             symptoms or history of epileptic seizures.

          6. Significant acute illness that did not completely resolve at least four weeks prior to
             the Screening visit.

          7. Abnormal laboratory values at screening that are in the opinion of the investigator
             are clinically significant and may jeopardize the safety of the study subject.

          8. Use of (or use within at least 5 half-lives before dosing) concomitant medications
             that are strong/moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A1/2, CYP2C9/19 or CYP3A4 (see
             Appendix B).

          9. Subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study.

         10. History or Ppresence of immunodeficiency diseases at the time of screening, based on
             medical history, including a positive HIV test result.

         11. History of a positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C result at
