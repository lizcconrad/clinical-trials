  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of a smoking cessation intervention
      combining behavioral treatment with low nicotine cigarettes on neuroimaging measures of
      reward function and smoking cessation outcomes. The results of this study will provide
      information about mechanisms contributing to smoking and smoking cessation and will help to
      guide future treatment studies.

      Smokers with mild depressive symptoms who are interested in quitting will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment conditions. In the BA +VLNC condition (n = 24) smokers will
      switch to smoking very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine patch
      for 5 weeks prior to their quit date. They will also participate in weekly behavioral
      activation (BA) treatment sessions. Smokers in the VLNC Only group (n = 24) will undergo the
      same pharmacological pretreatment but will undergo standard counseling instead of BA.
      Following the quit date, both groups will receive standard nicotine replacement therapy. At
      baseline and pre-quit, BOLD response to smoking and non-smoking rewards will be measured
      using fMRI after 24 hr abstinence. Latency to relapse will serve as a continuous clinical
      outcome measure.
