  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RUBI, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to either
      anakinra, or tocilizumab in refractory Non Infectious Uveitis (NIU). There is no firm
      evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in
      severe and refractory NIU. NIU can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal
      blindness. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission
      over 70 % of refractory/relapsing severe uveitis. The incidence of blindness in NIU has been
      dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of
      whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious
      uveitis. Contrasting with immunosuppressors, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly
      effective in steroid's sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma.

      Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in uveitis, which guarantees
      the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of
      efficacy already exists.
