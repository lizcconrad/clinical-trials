  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will enrol patients with acute severe brain injury who pass
      a spontaneous breathing trial but have decreased level of consciousness. It will directly
      compare (1) prompt extubation vs. (2) usual care, with extubation or tracheostomy timed
      according to physicians' discretion. The primary outcome will be ICU free days (days spent
      alive and outside an ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of patients suffer severe brain injuries every year, from causes such as trauma,
      stroke, and infection. Extensive clinical research in weaning from mechanical ventilation has
      led to recommendations for prompt extubation following a successful trial of spontaneous
      breathing in general intensive care unit (ICU). However, little evidence exists to guide
      decisions about when to remove the breathing tube in patients with severe brain injury. It is
      unclear which of the following strategies would optimize important patient outcomes: prompt
      extubation vs. waiting and extubating or performing a tracheostomy, timed according to
      physicians' discretion. Each strategy has associated risks: prompt extubation may lead to
      higher rates of extubation failure and reintubation, whereas waiting longer may expose
      patients to complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy may lead to
      procedural complications (or unnecessary procedures, if prompt extubation would be
      successful). This trial in brain-injured patients will test which of the following will lead
      to better patient outcomes: (1) removing the endotracheal tube promptly once a spontaneous
      breathing trial is passed; or (2) usual care, with the airway management strategy selected
      according to the preference of the treating physician.

The primary outcome will be measured to answer the following primary question: Among patients receiving minimal mechanical ventilatory support for severe and persistent brain injury, which of the following airway management strategies increase ICU-free days to day 60: (1) prompt extubation vs. (2) usual care, which may include extubation or tracheostomy timed according to physicians' discretion?</description>

    <description>This is an extubation by removal of endotracheal tube which must be done on the day of randomization or the following day. Any decision to subsequently reintubate the patient will be left to the discretion of the clinical team. Similarly, if a tracheostomy is deemed necessary in a patient who fails the extubation attempt, this will be managed at the discretion of the treating team. If for any reason the patient is not extubated according to the randomized schedule, the reason(s) will be recorded on a protocol violation form and the site investigator will be notified. If a patient receives a tracheostomy instead of being extubated we will again record reasons for this, but the patient will be analysed in the extubation group according to the intention-to-treat principle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Usual Care</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in this group will be treated according to usual care, which may include extubation (removal of endotracheal tube) or insertion of a tracheostomy, timed according to physicians' discretion. The inclusion of this arm will allow prompt extubation to be compared to usual practice, which often involves further observation and delayed decision-making due to clinician uncertainty about the optimal airway management strategy. Incorporation of usual care arms has been promoted as a design feature to improve the safety and interpretability of critical care clinical trials.</description>
