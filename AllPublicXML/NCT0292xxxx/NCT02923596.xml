  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this retrospective study is to review and analyze the information and data that
      has been already been generated during the course of routine practice of medicine by the
      investigators from 2007 up until Sept 1, 2016 from keloid patients who have sought medical
      care or medical advice for their keloid disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To retrospectively review and analyze clinical data that has already been collected from
      keloid patients including photographs taken of keloid lesions during routine practice of
      medicine by the investigators 1) To better understand natural history of keloid disorder
      (KD), 2)To determine the ethnic incidence and prevalence of keloid, 3) To determine the rate
      of familial keloids, 4) To determine response to different treatment modalities, 5) To
      determine risk factors for development and worsening of keloid lesions.

    <time_frame>1-5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Keloid Recurrence after surgery is a real-world outcome, one that takes time to develop. Study will intend to explore the long term rate of keloid recurrence after surgery. This rate will be reported as percentage of patients who undergo surgery and end up with developing a massive, semi-massive or large recurrent keloid</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of poor aesthetic outcome after ear surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1-5 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical intervention often results in loss of ear tissue and poor aesthetic outcome. Although fully expected, the actual rates of this outcome is unknown. Study intends to report the actual rate of disfigurement and poor aesthetic outcome after ear surgery for removal of keloid lesions.</description>
