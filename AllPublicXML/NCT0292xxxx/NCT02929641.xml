  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a polyp is found, it woulf be recorded by a white-light and OE1 model with magnification
      for assessing and predicting its histology. After that, its really histology will be reported
      by an pathologist.

      When a polyp is found, OE mode 1 with magnification was first used with near focus the polyp
      and an endoscopist made a real-time prediction of polyp pathology. After that,
      high-definition mode and OE mode 1 without magnification were used to observe polyp
      sequencely. The video of all procedure was recorded.

      After bowel cleansing with 2L polyethylene glycol, patients received colonoscopy under
      propofol intravenous anesthesia. When a polyp was found, we began to wash it and record the
      video. OE mode 1 with magnification was first used with near focus the polyp and an
      endoscopist made a real-time prediction of polyp pathology. After that, high-definition mode
      and OE mode 1 without magnification were used to observe polyp sequencely. Biopsy of the
      polyps were taken after observation, and the size of polyps was estimated by the biopsy
      forceps. The information of patient age, gender polyp morphology and location were recorded.
      After a video transcoding and clipping, the pathology type of each video clip was predicted
      by an endoscopist. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predicting value (PPV), negative
      predicting value (NPV) and accuracy were calculated. The pathology types of polyps were
      classified by non-neoplastic polyps and neoplastic polyps according to Vienna Classification.
      Statistics were performed by NCSS 11 and R software (Version 3.3.2).
