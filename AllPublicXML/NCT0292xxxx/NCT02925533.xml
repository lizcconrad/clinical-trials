    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two experimental drugs as a possible
      treatment for Bladder Cancer that recurred after treatment with standard therapy, or Bladder
      Cancer that got worse while on treatment with standard therapy.

      The following interventions will be involved in this study:

        -  B-701

        -  Pembrolizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved B-701 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for Bladder Cancer but it has been approved for other
      uses.

      This is the first time that B-701 in combination with Pembrolizumab will be given to humans.

      In this research study, Investigators are...

        -  Testing the effectiveness and safety of the combination of two experimental drugs (B-701
           and Pembrolizumab);

        -  Learning about the good and/or bad effects the drugs have on participants and their
           cancer;

        -  Administering B-701 and Pembrolizumab, which are antibodies (proteins that bind to other
           molecules), because...

             -  B-701 binds to a protein receptor called FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor
                3). FGFR3 has been found to be present (expressed) or changed (mutated) on the
                surface of in many types of cancer cells. Targeting FGFR3 may inhibit cancer
                growth.

             -  Pembrolizumab binds to a protein cell surface receptor called PD-1, which is found
                on certain types of lymphocytes and which are also involved in many types of
                cancer;

        -  Treating participants with Pembrolizumab, which is approved by the FDA for the treatment
           of Metastatic Melanoma, a Cancer of the skin;

        -  Collecting blood and tissue samples and other related medical information to learn more
           about the development of cancer and predictors of response;

        -  And hoping to learn how the combination of study drugs work in the treatment of cancer
           to help develop new treatments.

    <description>Pembrolizumab is an mAb that binds to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic (T4b, any N; or any T,
             N2-3) urothelial bladder cancer or transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) arising in
             another location of the urinary tract, including urethra, ureter, and renal pelvis.
             The diagnosis must be histologically or cytologically confirmed. Mixed histologies are
             permitted as long as TCC is the major component (i.e. &gt; 50% of the pathologic
             specimen). Pure or predominant squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas are not
             permitted.

          -  Relapsed after or refractory to one or two prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced or
             metastatic/recurrent disease (at least one cycle each) which have not included a PD-L1
             or FGFR inhibitor. At least one regimen should have included a platinum agent unless
             contraindicated for the subject. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (without a
             PD-L1 or FGFR inhibitor) is permitted and will not be counted as first-line
             chemotherapy, as long as the subject has not progressed within 12 months of the last
             dose. However, a regimen of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy will be counted as
             first-line chemotherapy if the patient progressed within 12 months of the last dose.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%)

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  EXCEPTION: Subjects with known Gilbert's disease: total bilirubin ≤ 3 ×
                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
                  (SGOT)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
                  ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule (such
             conditions should be discussed with the subject before study entry)

          -  The effects of B-701 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab may potentially cause fetal harm, women
             of child-bearing potential (defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug
             administration.

          -  Female of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medications. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

          -  Female of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or
             be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the
             study and through 4 months after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or
             radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving, or have received, any other investigational drugs or
             devices within the 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medications.

          -  Participants who received major surgery must be recovered adequately from the toxicity
             and/or complications from the interventions prior to starting therapy.

          -  Participants with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic
             steroid therapy (&gt;5 mg prednisone or its equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Participants who have a primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, or
             untreated/active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or
             corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Individuals with a history of treated CNS
             metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:

               -  Evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS

               -  Radiographic demonstration of stability upon the completion of CNS directed
                  therapy and no evidence of interim progression (for at least 4 weeks prior to the
                  first dose of study drug) between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the
                  screening radiographic procedure

               -  The screening CNS radiographic procedure is ≥ 8 weeks since completion of
                  radiotherapy and ≥ 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids and
                  anticonvulsants Note: These exceptions do not include carcinomatous meningitis
                  which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Participants with a history of allergic reactions attributed to monoclonal antibody
             therapy (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)

          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (&gt;5
             mg of prednisone or its equivalent) in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease
             modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy
             (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment.

          -  Participants with known evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Participants with an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Participants who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study
             therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
        are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated
        vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Participants who have had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 2 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of prohibited therapies, including
             any cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or biologic agent (approved or
             investigational) for the treatment of TCC are ineligible.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. All wounds must be fully healed on Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Participants with a history of other malignancy which could affect compliance with the
             protocol or interpretation of results. Individuals with a history of curatively
             treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix are allowed. Participants with a malignancy that has been treated with curative
             intent will also be allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment
             for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the risks with B-701 are unknown
             and pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with B-701 and
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate birth control throughout the study duration.

          -  Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive (or known history of HIV
             seropositive status) participants are ineligible because these underlying diseases
             will confound interpretation of important safety assessments, e.g. liver function
             tests, increased potential for reactivation or exacerbation of viral infections. Such
             individuals may be taking or require other drugs, and may be at higher risk of
             opportunistic infections and adverse effects. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV
             serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical
             trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown.

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Participants who weigh &gt; 110 kg will be ineligible due to study drug limitations
