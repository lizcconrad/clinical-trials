        The study will include adults with NVAF who are newly prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban,
        dabigatran, and VKA in 10 Italian Local Health Units (LHUs), during the study period, and
        meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  are at least 18 years of age at index date

          -  Initiated new OAC therapy ( no previous prescriptions of the same index OAC in the
             last 12 months prior to the index date ) during the study period

          -  Had at least 1 claim with diagnosis of AF anytime in their records

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a record that is indicative of Valvular Atrial Fibrillation during this period

          -  Have a history of the OACs prescribed during the study period as assessed during the
             period of data availability(i.e. history of index OAC, as patients need to be newly
             prescribed either apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or VKA)

          -  Have more than one OAC exposure which starts on the same date
