      The aim of this prospective study is to assess the efficacy of autologous Platelet Rich
      Plasma prepared with RegenKit-BCT in the prevention and the treatment of keloid scars
      refractory to conventional treatments. Fifteen patients were included and received three PRP
      injection sessions with a one-month interval. The outcomes were assessed at baseline (before
      treatment), 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the last injection session. Safety was assessed by
      reported adverse event analysis.
