      This study will help determine the appropriate type, amount and intensity of physical
      activity most beneficial for preventing weight regain after weight loss in older adults.

      The investigators will use a 3-group design in 180 older (65-85 years), obese (BMI=30-45
      kg/m2), sedentary men and women, all of whom will undergo a 9-month Weight Loss (WL)
      intervention (6-mo intensive phase and 3-mo reduced contact phase), followed by a 9-month
      self-managed follow-up phase with minimal contact, to test our overall hypothesis that
      intervening on Sedentary Behavior (SitLess) will enhance long-term Weight Loss in this age
      group. The diet element of the intervention is identical across groups, but groups differ by
      activity intervention: 1) structured, moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise (EX) (WL+EX); 2)
      intervening on SB throughout the day (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess).

    <description>All participants will undergo a dietary WL intervention designed to elicit behavioral changes leading to decreased caloric intake sufficient to yield a ~10% loss of initial body mass.
Participants will be encouraged and taught to reduce sedentary behavior (SB) during waking hours. The SitLess treatment targets increases in postural shifts and light, spontaneous physical activity (SPA) (MET level &lt;3).</description>
