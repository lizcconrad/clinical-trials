      Background

      Antigen-driven selection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathies.
      Patients with Gaucher's disease have an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies and
      symptomatic myeloma. Clonal immunoglobulin in patients with Gaucher's disease and in mouse
      models of Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy are reactive against lyso-glucosylceramide
      (LGL1), which is markedly elevated in these patients and mice. A recent report indicates that
      clonal immunoglobulins in 33% of sporadic human monoclonal gammopathies may also be specific
      for the lysolipids LGL1 and lysophosphatidylcholine. Substrate reduction ameliorates
      Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy in mice. This principle (that antigen removal can
      induce tumor regression) has been proven in other hematologic malignancies, where H. Pylori
      eradication causes lymphoma regression is a significant group of patients. Thus, as longterm
      immune activation by lysolipids may underlie both Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathies
      and some sporadic monoclonal gammopathies, this may represent a focus for treatment.

      Epicardial fat (EAT), the visceral fat of the heart, is highly enriched in genes involved in
      inflammation and lipid metabolism; it activates local and systemic inflammation and innate
      inflammatory response. EAT is rich in saturated fatty acids and has high protein content, and
      the greatest capacity for free fatty acids release and uptake among any other visceral fat
      depots. Of interest, EAT is highly enriched in sphingolipids, including ceramide. EAT
      clinical measurability with an ultrasound technique, first developed and validated by
      Iacobellis, and its rapid responsiveness and reduction to medications targeting the visceral
      fat, such as the glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues (GLP1A), as ongoing clinical trials are
      demonstrating, is of growing and remarkable interest.

      Study Hypothesis

      To target EAT, as marker of visceral fat, with GLP1A treatment to modulate/reduce/remove the
      antigen(s) (lipid/inflammatory/immune) stimulation for patients with monoclonal gammopathies
      that are lipid targeted.

      Study Design

      Interventional, single-group, open label pilot study. The investigators will identify
      monoclonal gammopathy patients whose antibodies are lipid/visceral fat targeted (goal is 10
      initially as a pilot) and who are overweight/obese (BMI &gt; 27). Eligible patients will be
      started on Liraglutide up to 1.8 mg sc once daily, as adjunct weight loss treatment for 12
      months.

      Study Endpoints

        -  Ultrasound measured EAT reduction by at least 20%

        -  Improvement in the monoclonal immunoglobulin profile Reduction in plasma ceramide and
           lipidomics levels

      Parameters will be monitored at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.
