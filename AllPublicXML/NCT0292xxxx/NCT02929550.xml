      Methods: All patients &lt;75 years registered in the Swedish Secondary Prevention after Heart
      Intensive care Admission registry (SEPHIA), will be followed-up within one year
      post-myocardia infarction (MI). The REACH risk prediction and a calibrated model for
      recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death will be used to estimate base case,
      and calibrated CVD outcomes based on gender-specific risk factors. The predicted impact of
      the LDL-C reduction on the risk of CVD will be based on Cholesterol Treatment Trialists´
      Collaboration findings.

      SWEDEHEART is a Swedish national registry consisting of several sub registries in which
      patients with acute coronary syndrome are prospectively registered. Patient characteristics,
      hospital treatments, drug treatments at discharge, and outcome for patients consecutively
      included and treated at all Swedish coronary care units are collected in this registry.SEPHIA
      is a sub registry collecting data on secondary prevention and cardiac rehabilitation.
      Follow-up are registered at six to ten weeks and at 12 to14 months post MI by office visits
      or phone. Around 80 % of all Swedish acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients below the age
      of 75 years are included in this register.

      In this study, a cohort of 5 904 (74% men) registered in the SEPHIA registry and who had one
      year follow-up during 2013, will be included. Data are aggregated and delivered from the
      SWEDEHEART/SEPHIA national registry. All patients were informed about their participation in
      the registry, the follow-up, and their right to decline participation. No written consent was
      obtained
