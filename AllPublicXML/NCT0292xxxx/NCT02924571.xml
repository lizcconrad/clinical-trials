  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to compare the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate
      (BMAC) and allograft versus to recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) in
      subjects undergoing elective thoracolumbar spinal fusion with interbody support. The
      investigators will look at the safety and efficacy of these two different surgical methods by
      assessing surgery outcomes and participants' quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are many available orthopaedic graft adjuncts which each have their own
      advantages and disadvantages. For example, although effective, BMPs are very expensive and
      have a risk of side effects. The use of BMAC may be a good alternative to the use of BMPs,
      and may not have the same side effects.

      Subjects who are scheduled for an elective spinal fusion and are enrolled in the study will
      be assigned to receive either BMP or BMAC. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires
      relating to quality of life, use of pain killers, and overall health, as well as have
      standard radiographic studies to examine the spine pre- and post-surgically. Subjects will
      attend 7 visits, which happen at the same time as the standard of care visits they would
      normally attend for their condition. Subjects will be followed in the study for 2 years in
      total.
