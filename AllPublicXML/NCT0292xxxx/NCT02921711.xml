        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative has been informed about the
             confidentiality of the study and has agreed to the collection of his/her personal data

          2. Patient has a ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysm for which:

               -  The parent artery has a diameter ≥ 2.0mm and ≤ 4.5 mm;

               -  The aneurysm neck size is ≥ 4mm or its dome-to-neck ratio is &lt; 2 (wide neck)

               -  Endovascular treatment with coils and one or more LVIS® devices has been
                  determined necessary for the patient by the multidisciplinary team

          3. Patient is aged ≥ 18 years

          4. Patient presents with a WFNS score between 0 and 3

          5. Patient has agreed to attend follow-up appointments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The use of an endovascular stent other than LVIS® has been determined necessary

          2. Patient presents with medical or surgical co-morbidities limiting his/her life
             expectancy to less than one year

          3. Patient has a contraindication to platelet inhibition treatment

          4. Patient requires retreatment of an aneurysm previously treated with a stent

          5. Patient is pregnant

          6. Patient has multiple aneurysms to be treated in one procedure
