      This project examines whether individuals' amount of activity energy expenditure (AEE) is
      related to adiposity and adiposity/diabetes-related hormones in a diverse sample of 2500, and
      to test the ecological hypothesis that a decline in levels of AEE is an important cause of
      the increases in obesity that are currently taking place in many societies.

      One goal is to use doubly labeled water and/or accelerometers to objectively measure activity
      energy expenditure in community samples from five adult populations across the spectrum of
      obesity risk. From each site, (i.e., Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica, and the US),
      500 black adults will be recruited. Among all participants, AEE will be measured using
      accelerometers and in a subset of 75 per site, AEE will also be measured by doubly labeled
      water.

      The doubly labeled water sample will be used to confirm site-specific concordance with the
      accelerometer measurements and to estimate population mean levels of AEE. Additionally, body
      composition, dietary intake, fasting glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and ghrelin will
      be measured. The relationships between calories expended in activity and body composition,
      dietary intake, glucose, hormones and adipocytokines, both within and between each population
      using doubly labeled water and accelerometers will be examined. In this longitudinal study,
      weight will be measured at 12 and 24-months, and AEE by accelerometer will be assessed at
      enrollment and again at 2-years of follow-up; associations between change in AEE and change
      in weight will be estimated.

      The central purpose of this project is to test whether AEE or change in AEE can be identified
      as a contributory mechanism to population-wide weight gain and, if so, to quantify its
      importance. In addition, we seek to understand the interrelationships between the
      adipocytokines and the hormones ghrelin and insulin as well as AEE in the regulation of body
      weight across the continuum of body mass indices (BMI) represented by these five populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Populations all over the world are experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of obesity
      and diabetes. To date, the public health response to the emerging obesity epidemic has been
      almost totally ineffective. As a first line of response, professional bodies and government
      organizations have issued prevention guidelines, all of which include recommendations on
      levels of activity energy expenditure (AEE). However, even if fully implemented, it is not
      clear that the current recommendations on AEE would impact the trend in age-related weight
      gain. In fact, there is virtually no direct evidence that can be brought to bear on the
      question of whether the obesity epidemic has resulted primarily or even partially from
      society-wide declines in habitual physical activity (PA).

      To date, epidemiologic research on AEE has relied on very crude measurement toolsâ€”primarily
      questionnaires. These self-reported data capture only a small fraction of the total variance
      in activity and are potentially confounded when they focus on leisure-time PA. By contrast,
      direct measurement with doubly labeled water (DLW) provides a precise, unbiased estimate of
      all forms of non-resting energy expenditure. DLW has also been used to validate the new
      generation of accelerometers which are efficient measurement tools for larger studies.

      In this study, objective measurement tools will be used to examine the &quot;ecology of AEE&quot;. This
      study will take place in 5 countries spanning the range of the activity-obesity spectrum and
      will combine both within-population person-level and between-population ecological analyses.
      First, the study will examine whether an individual's amount or pattern of AEE is related to
      adiposity in a diverse sample of 2,500. Second, the study will evaluate whether a decline in
      levels of AEE is an important cause of the rapid increases in obesity that currently take
      place in many societies. As an exploratory aim we will examine the role of selected
      adipocytokines and the appetite hormone ghrelin.
