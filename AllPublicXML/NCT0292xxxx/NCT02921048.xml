      This observational study recruits healthy individuals who have been routinely taking high
      amount (at least 3 g/wk) of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), and those who don't, and examines the efficacy of dietary EPA and DHA in ameliorating
      the cardiopulmonary effects of exposure to ambient air pollution.

      Purpose: To examine the relationship between blood levels of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and cardiopulmonary responses to environmental air
      pollution in healthy adults. EPA and DHA are two important omega-3 fatty acids that are
      mainly found in seafoods and fish oils and associated with beneficial effects to human
      physiology.

      Participants: Healthy 35-55 year-old male and female subjects will be screened for their
      dietary intake of EPA and DHA. Qualified volunteers will be divided into two groups, group 1:
      individuals voluntarily taking at least 3 g/wk of EPA and DHA from dietary sources including
      fish oil supplements and ocean fish/shellfish consumption for a period of at least 6 months
      prior to enrollment in the study; group 2: individuals who have consumed no more than 1
      serving size (4-6 oz)/month of ocean fish/shellfish, or no more than 1 pill/month of fish oil
      supplement during the 6 month period preceding enrollment.

      Procedures (Methods): In this observational panel study, subjects will come to the U.S. EPA
      Human Studies Facility for up to 5 sessions, each consisting of 2 consecutive visit days. The
      following endpoints will be collected: blood pressure, heart rate variability measurements,
      blood biomarkers, endothelial cell function, retinal venule and arteriole diameter, and lung
      function. Air pollution exposure will be assessed using area-specific air quality data
      derived from local air monitoring stations interfaced with activity monitoring and GPS
      tracked location for each subject.
