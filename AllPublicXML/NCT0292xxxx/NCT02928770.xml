  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new approach for treating patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea and/or snoring. The new nasal device, nastent (NAS: nasal airway
      stent), appears to be a useful alternative or additive treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nasal stent basically helps to splint the soft palate open. Subjects have a baseline
      (diagnostic) sleep study without wearing the device. Subjects are then fitted with the device
      and then subjects wear the device for at least 7 nights during their sleep while at home.
      Subjects then return for a repeat in-laboratory sleep study while wearing the device. The
      primary outcome is to assess the effectiveness of the device by change in the apnea-hypopnea
      index (number of sleep-related abnormal breathing events per hour of sleep) while wearing the
      device compared to baseline.
