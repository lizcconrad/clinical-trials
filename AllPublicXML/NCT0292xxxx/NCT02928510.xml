      This research trial studies the mechanisms of idelalisib-associated diarrhea in patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma, or small lymphocytic lymphoma
      that has come back after a period of improvement. The cancer treatment drug idelalisib
      triggers diarrhea in some patients. Studying stool, blood, and tissue samples in the lab from
      patients who are given idelalisib may help doctors learn more about the side effects and may
      help to treat them in future patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of idelalisib-induced diarrhea/colitis in
      relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), relapsed indolent non-hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL),
      or relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

      II. To further understand the mechanism of action (MOA) of idelalisib in context of the nodal
      microenvironment and the possible involvement of the immune system in idelalisib's
      anti-lymphoma activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a physical examination during visit 1. A stool sample, blood sample, and 6
      biopsies are collected at visit 2, and patients undergo a flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy.
      Patients receive idelalisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) after visit 2. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A third research visit occurs
      upon development of idelalisib-associated diarrhea/colitis symptoms. Patients with
      diarrhea/colitis symptoms undergo a full colonoscopy and collection of stool and blood
      samples. Control patients with no diarrhea/colitis symptoms undergo all needed tests and
      assessments including a flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy and collection of stool and blood
      samples. All patients undergo optional biospecimen collection at the time of disease
      progression.
