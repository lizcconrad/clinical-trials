      This survey is intended to collect efficacy and safety data of Duphaston® Tablets in patients
      with endometriosis under actual condition of its use and to obtain data for effectively and
      safely utilizing this drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Japan, Duphaston® Tablets have appeared in 1965 for the treatment of endometriosis and
      been used at some medical institutions. However, after releasing of danazol in the early
      1980's and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in the late 1980's, pseudomenopause
      therapy became mainstream because of its high efficacy. However, pseudopregnancy therapy was
      recognized again due to adverse reactions associated with pseudomenopause therapy. After
      2000, low-dose estrogen/progestin (LEP) combination drugs (as LEP products,
      ethinylestradiol/norethisterone combination drug and ethinylestradiol/drospirenone
      combination drug) and dienogest have been utilized as drugs that are safer and can be
      administered for a long time. In recent years, Duphaston® Tablets are increasing recognized
      again from the viewpoints of its efficacy and safety because the drug has no effect to
      inhibit ovulation or effect on basal body temperature, a diagnosis of ovulation and other
      conditions may be made by following up basal body temperature, and pregnancy may be achieved
      even during treatment with Duphaston. As previously mentioned, Duphaston® Tablets are an old
      drug, and there are only few clinical data from Japanese patients; thus, its latest clinical
      efficacy and safety data are being demanded again mainly by obstetrician-gynecologists.

    <measure>Change in the volume of ovarian chocolate cyst (If there are two or more cysts, a total volume)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment initiation (baseline), 3 months, and 5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In measurement of ovarian chocolate cyst, on a section visualizing the maximum diameter, two radial directions, namely the maximum diameter (D1) and maximum diameter (D2) orthogonal to D1, will be measured. A chocolate cyst of the ovary will be deemed as a spheroid, and its volume will be calculated using the following formula: [(D1 + D2) × 1/2]3 × 0.52 (π = 3.1). If there are two or more chocolate cysts of the ovary, similarly, two radial directions (D1 and D2) of each cyst will be measured. Also, each of their volumes will be calculated in the same manner.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in dysmenorrhea score (total of a dysmenorrhea severity score and a score for the use of analgesics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, and 5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A dysmenorrhea score will be calculated using a total of a dysmenorrhea severity score and a score for the use of analgesics.
A dysmenorrhea severity score is defined as follows. None: Score 0, Rarely interfering with work (study and house work): Score 1, Interfering with work (study and house work) requiring lying down to rest: Score 2, Being confined to bed for 1 day, being unable to work (study and house work): Score 3.
A score for the use of analgesics is defined as follows. None: Score 0, An analgesic was used for a day during the last (or current) menstruation period: Score 1, An analgesic was used for 2 days during the last (or current) menstruation period: Score 2, An analgesic was used for 3 days during the last (or current) menstruation period: Score 3</description>

    <measure>Occurrence of AEs and ADRs</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of dosage start, up to 5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>If an AE (including an abnormal laboratory value) occurred, the following information should be collected: AE term, Date of onset of AE, Severity, Seriousness, Serious/non-serious, Outcome, Date of outcome, Causal relationship with Duphaston, Action for Duphaston, and If an abnormal change in a laboratory value is noted, the applicable laboratory value.</description>
