      Study RGX-104-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of
      RGX-104, an oral small molecule targeting the liver X receptor (LXR), as a single agent and
      in combination with nivolumab. RGX-104 activates LXR, resulting in depletion of both
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as tumor blood vessels. MDSCs block the
      ability of T-cells and other cells of the immune system from attacking tumors.

      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses and schedules of orally administered RGX-104
      with or without nivolumab (single agent or combination therapy) will be evaluated in patients
      with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or
      metastatic) who have had progressive disease (PD) on available standard systemic therapies or
      for which there are no standard systemic therapies of relevant impact.

      In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma
      (EOC), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), renal
      cell cancer (RCC), bladder cancer (BLC), or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be
      treated at the MTD (or maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD if
      there is evidence suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile). This stage will provide
      further characterization of the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics, including
      biomarkers of immunologic activity and LXR target activation, of RGX-104 as a single agent
      (EOC) and in combination with nivolumab (melanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, RCC, BLC, and TNBC).

          1. Histologic or cytologic evidence of a malignant solid tumor or lymphoma (any
             histology) and must have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either metastatic
             or locally advanced and unresectable (and for which additional radiation therapy or
             other locoregional therapies are not considered feasible).

          2. Patients enrolled in the dose escalation stages must have disease that is resistant to
             or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy, or for which there is no
             standard systemic therapy or reasonable therapy in the physician's judgment likely to
             result in clinical benefit or if such therapy has been refused by the patient.
             Documentation of the reason must be provided for patients who have not received a
             standard therapy likely to result in clinical benefit.

          3. Patients enrolled in the expansion stages must agree to a tumor biopsy to be obtained
             during the screening period and during Cycle 2 or at the time of PD, if earlier. If a
             biopsy is deemed by the investigator to not be in the patient's best interest, prior
             approval must be obtained from the Medical Monitor to waive this requirement.

          4. Patients enrolled in the single agent expansion stage must have a diagnosis of EOC,
             while patients enrolled in the combination dose escalation or expansion stage must
             have a diagnosis of melanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, RCC, BLC, or TNBC.

             other systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to study therapy administration
             (42 days for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin-C; patients with advanced prostate cancer
             who are receiving LHRH agonists are permitted onto the study and should continue use

             concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in
             situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and
             melanoma in situ), organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive
             disease.

          7. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any NYHA Class 3
             or 4 CHF, uncontrolled angina, history of MI, unstable angina or stroke within 6
             months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant
             arrhythmias not controlled by medication).

          8. Uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the
             study.

          9. Known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases. CNS imaging is not
             required prior to study entry unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement.
             Patients with stable, treated brain metastases are eligible provided there is no
             evidence of CNS disease growth on imaging for at least 8 weeks following radiation
             therapy or other locoregional ablative therapy to the CNS.

         10. Condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to
             study therapy administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence
             of active autoimmune disease.

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled
