      End-of- life care is a major issue in medical ethics with life support technology progress.
      Intensive care may prolong the dying process in patients who have been unresponsive to the
      treatment already provided. Withholding or withdrawing of life support (WLS) care was
      introduced to avoid the suffering of critically ill patients. Decision to WLS is a difficult
      and affected by several factors including not only disease severity but also ethics,
      religion, culture, and legal background. In western countries, advance directives had an
      important role to WLS for dying patients and honor patient autonomy. However, the illegality
      of advance directives in Korea and Korean culture under Confucianism, requiring children to
      do the best to treat their parents in the name of filial piety make physicians and family
      members difficult to WLS in terminally ill patients.

      Additionally, WLS in intensive care unit had been usually decided without official
      documentation before the final legal decision by Supreme Court in Korea. Scanty information
      exists about end-of-life practices because informed consents of WLS were taken after the
      legal decision.

      Thus, we aimed to investigate the current status of informed consent at the time of decision
      to WLS and difference between WLS group and non-WLS group in Korea.
