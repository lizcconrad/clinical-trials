  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain edema is the main reason for the disability and lethality in traumatic brain injury,
      which is the most difficult part of emergency rescue. Recently, there is no medical equipment
      to monitor the early brain edema in clinic. We have found that Electrical impedance
      tomography (EIT) can perform the real-time and bedside monitoring of brain electrical
      impedance after single-dose mannitol treatment, which may be a new strategy for the
      surveillance of brain edema. In this study, we would like to compare the application in
      traumatic brain edema between EIT and Noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring,
      including the progress of brain edema, the relationship between impedance and ICP, and the
      improvement for the patients' prognosis. EIT would probably be a new image strategy for the
      treatment of traumatic brain injury.

    <measure>Disability Rating Scale (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>on the 1st day (enrollment), seventh day after hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>The DRS includes measures of eye opening, verbalization, and motor response (derived from the Glasgow Coma Scale); cognitive understanding of feeding, dressing, and grooming; degree of assistance and supervision required; and employability. Scores range from 0 to 29, with higher values indicating greater disability.</description>
