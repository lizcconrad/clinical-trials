  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to define the mean, variance, and dose proportionality
      for tenofovir-diphosphate(TFV-DP) in dried blood spots resulting from 33%, 67%, and 100% of
      daily dosing with 200mg emtricitabine and 300mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (as
      TruvadaÂ®). With this information, a model will be established to predict adherence rates to
      TFV-DP using DBS. Forty-eight healthy HIV-uninfected adult participants who are at low risk
      for HIV infection will be randomized to one of 6 sequences consisting of two directly
      observed dosing regimens, 33%/67%, 33%/100%, 67%/33%, 67%/100%, 100%/33%, and 100%/67% with
      each dose regimen lasting approximately 12 weeks, separated by an approximately 12 week
      washout period. DBS will be collected at regular intervals, including during the washout. The
      hypothesis of the study is that levels of TFV-DP in DBS will predict adherence rates in the
      preceding 1-3 months.
