    <textblock>
      Sugammadex, a modified Î³-cyclodextrin is a selective relaxant-binding agent that reverses the
      effects of steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents, rocuronium and vecuronium. It shows its
      activity by encapsulating these. Likewise, some other steroid hormones and drugs like
      flucloxacillin, toremifene, fusidic acid can also be effected. Thus, assuming that
      methylprednisolone would also be encapsulated by sugammadex and decrease its efficiency, in
      this study we aimed to compare the recovery times from recuronium-induced muscle relaxation
      after reversal with sugammadex between patients who receive intraoperative methylprednisolone
      or not.

      After institutional review board (IRB) approval and informed consent, 100 patients will be
      enrolled in this prospective, single center, controlled study. Anaesthesia will be induced
      with propofol (3mg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg), followed by sevoflurane maintenance.
      Patients will be divided into two groups (Group M, n: 53 and group C, n: 47,
      methylprednisolone administered group and control group respectively) according to the
      requirement of methylprednisolone administration which is dictated by the type of the
      surgical procedure. Neuromuscular blockade will be monitored using calibrated train-of-four
      (TOF-Carescape B 650 NMT, GE, Connecticut, USA). Once rocuronium-induced neuromuscular
      blockade recovers spontaneously to TOF-count-two, all patients will receive 2.0 mg/kg of
      sugammadex. Neuromuscular monitoring will be continued until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9
      at the ulnar nerve. The time to recovery of TOF to 0.7 and 0.9 will be compared in both
      groups. The statistical analyses will be performed using Student T Test and Mann-Whitney U
      test.

    <description>At the end of the procedure, train of four (TOF) monitorisation was continued and once rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade recovered spontaneously to TOF-count-two, all patients received 2.0 mg/kg of sugammadex. Then, neuromuscular monitoring was continued until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.7 and then to 0.9 at the ulnar nerve. The time needed for the recovery of TOF to 0.7 and 0.9 were noted.</description>

    <description>Patient in this group received general anaesthesia for surgical procedures. During the anesthesia management methylprednisolone was administered intravenously (1mg/kg) to the patients in this group, according to the type of the surgical procedure. Also neuromuscular monitorisation was performed to assess the train of four ratio at the end of the procedure, after the reversal of neuromuscular block. All patients were followed during the recovery period from general anaesthesia and the time needed to regain a full neuromuscular recovery was noted. For that, the train of four ratio was followed up and the ratio of 0.7 and 0.9 were recorded.</description>

    <description>Patients who received general anaesthesia and endothracheal entubation but who did not require methyprednisone during general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study as control group. Neuromuscular monitorisation was performed to assess the train of four ratio at the end of the procedure, after the reversal of neuromuscular block. All patients were followed during the recovery period from general anaesthesia and the time needed to regain a full neuromuscular recovery was noted. For that, the train of four ratio was followed up and the ratio of 0.7 and 0.9 were recorded.</description>
