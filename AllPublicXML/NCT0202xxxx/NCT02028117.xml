      This study is a phase I/II open label clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant
      epithelial ovarian cancer. The Phase I part of the study will determine the dose of
      enadenotucirev to be recommended for further studies and will examine primarily the safety
      and tolerability but also the pharmacokinetics of administering enadenotucirev
      intraperitoneally. Once the dose of IP enadenotucirev to be used in combination with IV
      weekly paclitaxel has been determined, the phase II stage will begin as an open label dose
      expansion of that regimen. The phase II stage aims to determine whether intraperitoneal
      enadenotucirev has a risk benefit profile that supports further investigation in the
      treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian Cancer.
