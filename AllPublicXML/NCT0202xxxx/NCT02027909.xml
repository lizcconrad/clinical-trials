  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Providing ideal rate response to patients should improve their quality of life and ability to
      execute activities of daily living.

      Medtronic pacemakers provide rate response pacing by utilizing dual zone programming to
      specify an &quot;activities of daily living&quot; (ADL) response rate and an &quot;exertion&quot; response rate.
      There is much data to support the target heart rate for an exercise response but the data to
      support the programming of the ADL rate is lacking.

      Medtronic pacemakers provide rate response pacing by utilizing dual zone programming to
      specify an &quot;activities of daily living&quot; (ADL) response rate and an &quot;exertion&quot; response rate.
      There is much data to support the target heart rate for an exercise response but the data to
      support the programming of the ADL rate is lacking.

      Unpublished Holter data from our center indicates that the ADL rate for most patients in our
      practice is between 50-70bpm rather than 95bpm. Moreover, this increased ADL rate may impact
      diastolic filling times and adversely impact cardiac output.
