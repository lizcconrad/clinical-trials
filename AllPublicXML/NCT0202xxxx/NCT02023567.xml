  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with high
      recurrence rate, suicide rate and disability rate. It's reported that the global burden
      caused by MDD will be up to the second rank among all the disease burdens by 2020. China is
      also confronted with the daunting challenges against MDD. It's assessed that the monthly
      incidence of MDD is 6.1%, non-hospitalizing rate reaches up to 92% and the non-treatment rate
      is approximate 95%. However, to date, the pathogenesis of MDD is obscure and the current
      therapies don't work well. Therefore, it's urgent and critical to elucidate the pathogenesis
      of MDD, to develop early diagnostic criteria and effective intervention in MDD. Considering
      the diversity of weights on genetic factor and environmental factor in MDD, in this project,
      the investigators aim firstly to explore the effect of &quot;genetic-environmental interaction&quot;on
      the pathogeny of MDD for classifying MDD into &quot;genetic type&quot;, &quot;environmental type&quot; and
      &quot;others&quot; based on a case-control study. We next conduct the neurobiological, neurocognitive
      and psycho-behavioral assessments among MDD, schizophrenia and healthy groups to screen the
      salient endophenotypes for establishing the diagnostic models of MDD . The investigators
      further analyse the changes of these indicators after 8 weeks'medication to select the
      potential predictors for therapeutic evaluations and interventional options in MDD patients.
      Finally, the investigators continue a 2-year follow-up study to test and verify the
      predictors of prognosis in MDD patients.
