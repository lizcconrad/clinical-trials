  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stretching is frequently used in clinical practice to manage musculoskeletal discomfort and
      to prevent sports injuries. It is not known if stretching affects pain sensitivity. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate if a 4 week daily stretching protocol alters pain
      sensitivity.

      The investigators hypothesize that stretching reduces pain sensitivity.
