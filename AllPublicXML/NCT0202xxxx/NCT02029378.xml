  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute neuromuscular weakness in
      the Western World and can occur at any age. GBS is a rpadily progressive 'inflammatory'
      disorder of the perihperal nerves often leading to sever paresis of the limbs. Most GBS
      patients also have sensory disturbances (tingling or dull feeling) and pain. Some patients
      also have double vision or problems with swallowing. GBS mau also involve the respiratory
      muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. GBS
      pateints have a vairable prognosis; 20-30% require mechnical ventilation for a period ranging
      from weeks to months, 20% are unable to walk after 6 months nad 3-5% dies. Progression of
      weakness in GBS is usually rapid and reaches its peak within 4 weeks in the majority of
      patients, but many develop their maximum deficit within 2 weeks. Thereafter, the patients
      have a variable prognosis.

      GBS is a treatable disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg administered in 5 days
      was shown to be effective when administered within the first two weeks after onset of
      symptoms, and is considered the treatment of choice by most experts in the field. Although
      the standard treatment for GBS is a single course of IVIg (2g/kg administered in 5 days),
      many patients fails to recover abd remain with substantial disability. Patients with GBS and
      especially those with a poor prognosis potentially may benefit from more powerful abd when
      possible a more mechanistically rational therapy.

      Recent experimental evidence suggests that complement activation palys a crucial role in the
      development of neuromuscular weakness in GBS making complement inhibitors and regulators
      attracive therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that Eculizumab, with its function as a
      complement inhibitor, will be very effective in preventing progression of weakness in
      patients with GBS.
