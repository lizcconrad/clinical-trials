      (1)Indication:Chronic Heart Failure.(2) Objectives: Primary objective is to evaluate the
      efficacy of the Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Platform online compared with the
      regular clinic follow up in subjects with CHF (II-III class by NYHA).Secondary objectives is
      to assess the safety of the Management Platform online in subjects with CHF.(3) Study design:
      Prospective, randomized,controlled study with two follow up management groups: 1) the
      Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Follow up Online;2) the regular monthly clinic
      follow up.Study population:Totally 1000 male and female subjects with CHF (II-III functional
      classes according to NYHA classification).(4) Quality assurance plan that addresses data
      validation and registry procedures, including any plans for site monitoring and auditing.(5)
      Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or
      consistency with other data fields in the registry.(6) Source data verification to assess the
      accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to
      external data sources.(7)Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and
      analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data
      analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management.(8)Duration of follow up: The
      total follow-up time shall be 12 months.(9)Safety Assessment:Safety of the study will be
      evaluated by the following assessments: 1)Subject examinations (during the follow up period
      and extending up to 2 week after the end of the study) consisting of a subject interview
      (including direct questioning about adverse events), physical examination, assessment of body
      weight, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (UCG), Left ventricular ejection fraction,
      assessed by echocardiography, The N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP), a peptide hormone whose plasma concentration is inversely related to the
      severity of HF, NYHA functional status, assessed by subject interview, Quality of life (QoL),
      assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ), a validated
      questionnaire assessing QoL in subjects with heart failure. 2)Evaluation of clinically
      relevant safety laboratory parameters, such as complete blood count, serum creatinine,
      electrolytes, and liver enzymes.Any Adverse Events (AE) or Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and
      its potential causal relationship with the study will be recorded and evaluated.(10)

        1000 subjects with chronic, moderate heart failure (NYHA functional class II-III) with
        reduced ejection fraction (≤45%) will be enrolled (500 randomly allocated to receive and
        500 to receive placebo in addition to standard therapy). Determination of study eligibility
        will be established by the Investigator on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion
        criteria.
