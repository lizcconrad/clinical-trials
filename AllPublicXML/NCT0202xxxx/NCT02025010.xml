  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing the safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate alone, followed
      by the addition of prednisone (when the participant's disease worsens or the physician feels
      it would lessen symptoms of toxicity) versus the current approved treatment regimen which
      involves the concomitant use of prednisone in conjunction with abiraterone acetate.
      Additionally, this study is also examining why participants stop responding to treatment with
      abiraterone acetate by evaluating blood and tissue.

      -  Participants will be treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) in 28-day cycles.
           Participants will be monitored (weekly for the first two cycles, then on Day 1 of each
           subsequent cycle) for symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess
           (including hypertension, hypokalemia). For participants who experience symptoms of
           persistent or severe hypertension or hypokalemia as detailed in the above schema,
           prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily will be added. We will monitor for other symptoms
           of AA toxicity to include fluid retention and fatigue.

        -  For participations who tolerate AA monotherapy without the addition of prednisone to
           manage symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess, prednisone 5 mg by
           mouth twice daily will be added at Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression.
           Participants will be continued on study until symptomatic or radiographic progression or
           taken off study for another reason as detailed in protocol.

        -  Participants will undergo pre-treatment and progression tumor biopsies. Participants
           will also undergo pre-treatment and progression tumor biopsies for assessment of
           possible mechanisms of AA resistance. After the progression biopsy is performed,
           protocol therapy will be discontinued. Participants who stop protocol therapy before
           receiving four cycles of AA will not be asked to undergo the second biopsy.

        -  Correlative Studies: Participants will undergo assessment of serum corticosteroid
           intermediates and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at baseline and subsequent
           treatment visits for correlation with symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess.
