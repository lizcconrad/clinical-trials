  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled subjects with
      eosinophilic CRSwNP. Subjects were randomized to receive either budesonide inhalation
      suspension or placebo for 14 days. Visual analogue scales (VAS）of nasal symptoms, endoscopic
      polyp scores and morning serum cortical levels were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Polyp
      samples were evaluated for inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by immunoassay; collagen by histochemistry;
      and frequencies of different inflammatory T cell infiltration by flow cytometry. this study
      is undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of short-term prescription of budesonide inhalation
      suspension via transnasal nebulization by clinical and immunologic assessments. As outcome
      parameters for remodeling, differences in the expression of collagen and albumin were
      investigated before and after budesonide treatment. Meanwhile, TGF-β, MMPs and TIMPs
      expression differences in nasal polyps were investigated to explore underlying mechanisms of
      tissue reconstitution.
