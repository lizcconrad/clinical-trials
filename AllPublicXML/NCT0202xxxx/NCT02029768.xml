  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis 1: A quantifiable difference in inflammatory cytokines exist in women with burn
      injury and this correlates with clinical markers of outcome

      Hypothesis 2: The amount of adipose tissue contributes to the severity of cellular immune
      response (CMI) dysregulation in response to burn injury

      Skin-fold caliper measurements will be taken on consented patients (both male and female) to
      determine body fat percentage. Serum samples will be obtained from these patients. The level
      of inflammatory cytokines in the serum will be measured to determine if there is a link
      between body fat percentage, pro-inflammatory cytokines and the ability of women to survive
      burn injury.

      Consented patients admitted to University Medical Center with greater than 15% total body
      surface area burns will participate in this study. A skin-fold caliper measurement will be
      performed to determine body fat percentage. Serum samples will be obtained and assayed for
      inflammatory cytokines to establish whether or not a link between obesity in women and
      pro-inflammatory cytokines exists. If so, obesity may be a factor which contributes to the
      gender disparity in burn wound survival.
