      The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of low-dose (25mg) prolonged
      administration (in 6 hours) of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) on in-hospital
      mortality and outcomes in patients with massive PE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is life threatening disease requiring early diagnosis and treatment.
      Thrombolytic therapy (TT) is required in patients with massive PE. PE has a high mortality
      but the in-hospital all-cause case mortality rates were lower in unstable patients who
      received TT than those who did not. However, it was reported that minority (nearly 30%) of
      unstable patients received thrombolytic therapy. The reason that majority of unstable
      patients failed to receive thrombolytic therapy is unclear. The higher rates of complications
      including the life threatening bleeding may be a reason of reluctance in the use of TT.

      The lungs are the only organ receiving the entire cardiac output. Therefore, they are the
      point of convergence for the entire molecules of the thrombolytic agent, independent from the
      route of administration. So that lower doses of the TT might be effective in PE, with the
      additional benefits of enhancing its safety profile. The percutaneous endovenous intervention
      for deep venous thrombosis has suggested an exquisitely favorable pulmonary response to
      low-dose thrombolysis. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of low-dose
      (25mg) prolonged administration (in 6 hours) of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) on
      in-hospital mortality and outcomes in patients with massive PE.

      The primary end points consisted of in hospital all cause mortality, major complications,
      pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. Secondary points are all cause
      mortality, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction at 6 month.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with massive PE aged 18 years or older with confirmed PE and able to give informed
        consent will be included in the study. PE is defined according to current guidelines as
        adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of PE plus imaging
        documentation on computed tomography angiography. Massive PE was defined as acute PE with
        sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure&lt;90 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes or
        requiring inotropic support, not due to a cause other than PE, such as arrhythmia,
        hypovolemia, sepsis, or left ventricular [LV] dysfunction), pulselessness, or persistent
        profound bradycardia (heart rate&lt;40 bpm with signs or symptoms of shock).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular
        disease (eg, arteriovenous malformation), known malignant intracranial neoplasm, ischemic
        stroke within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis,
        recent surgery encroaching on the spinal canal or brain, and recent significant closed-head
        or facial trauma with radiographic evidence of bony fracture or brain injury were excluded
        from the study.
