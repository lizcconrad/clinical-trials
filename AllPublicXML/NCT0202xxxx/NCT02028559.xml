    <textblock>
      A feasibility study to test the ability to move kidney stones using a modified ultrasound
      system. It is the goal of our technology to move the stone fragments to a location within the
      kidney to improve their chances of passage, and thus reduce the occurrence of additional
      symptomatic events and retreatment.

      Our research group has developed a new, non-invasive technology using low intensity focused
      ultrasound to reposition kidney stones. This is essentially a conventional diagnostic
      ultrasound system that is also programmed with longer ultrasounds bursts (50 ms) to impart
      sufficient energy to physically move a stone. These are similar to pulses that may be used in
      elastography or acoustic radiation force imaging. Like conventional ultrasound, the probe is
      placed in contact with the patient's skin to image the stone following standard ultrasound
      imaging procedure. The same probe is then used to focus the ultrasound and apply a burst (a
      sequence of pulses) of acoustic force to push the stone. Brightness mode (B-mode) imaging is
      interleaved with the &quot;pushing&quot; pulses (Push-mode) to monitor stone movement. The Push can be
      applied to any location and any depth within the image. The user controls the burst
      amplitude. To control probe surface heating, and thus patient safety, the system is
      programmed to control when the user is allowed to conduct the next push.
