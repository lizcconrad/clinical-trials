      There are certain categories of diseases which are more prevalent in the Arab world due to
      increased rates of consanguinity in relatively isolated populations. The goal is to discover
      these mutations by using next-generation human genetics tools. These include high-throughput
      sequencing and genotyping along with the necessary bioinformatics analyses that will lead to
      the discovery of the causes of most inherited diseases in the region.The secondary objective
      will be to build a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in the Arab world. This will
      include all detected mutations, not only the subset that are causing disease (from primary
      objective), but also known trait-altering mutations as well as general diversity on the DNA
      level among human populations of this region. This catalogue can become a widely useful
      resource for many projects down the road, as it relies on anonymizing individual samples and
      instead displaying data in aggregate as the cohorts of collected samples grow over the years.

      The study will include all genetic disorders from all ethnic backgrounds but Mendelian
      disease for which a gene mutation has already been identified will be excluded.

      Evidence of Mendelian Transmission determined by fulfilling one of the following criteria:

      Multiple affected family members (at least first degree relative with disease) History of
      consanguinity Severe disease in newborn in the absence of family history Sydromic disease in
      single individuals Congenital abnormality affecting major organ system(s) Mendelianized
      extremes of common disease (eg sever familial diabetes/ obesity/ hypertension)
