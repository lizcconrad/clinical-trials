      Assess progression-free survival and overall survival of proton beam therapy (PBT) for
      patients with resectable vs. unresectable esophageal cancer, and to assess patient-reported
      outcomes of PBT for esophageal cancer at 6 months following chemoradiation and
      physician-reported toxicity of PBT for esophageal cancer.

    <description>We will calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for all QOL data (EQ-5D, SF-12) in addition to other PROs (depressive symptoms, social support) at each evaluation period. Univariate tests will explore the associations among QOL and PROs using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's exact test for correlation. Changes over time in QOL and PROs will be analyzed utilizing repeated-measures modeling techniques (repeated measures analysis of covariance).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical or
             thoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction or cardia of stomach.

          -  Staged by PET/CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) OR CT w/contrast and EGD to have
             stage II or III disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is encouraged but not required.

          -  Prior endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with a diagnosis of stage II or III
             esophageal cancer is eligible, irrespective of margin status.

          -  Induction chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation is allowed.

          -  Prior thoracic radiation is allowable if degree of overlap with the esophageal
             radiotherapy treatment is deemed to be safe by the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document.

          -  English speaker.

          -  Financial coverage for proton therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned treatment with radiation therapy alone without concurrent chemotherapy or
             chemotherapy alone.

          -  Previous or concomitant cancers within the past 3 years other than curatively treated

             for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and low risk prostate cancer. Except
             for prostate cancer (which can be observed if low risk), other cancers listed must
             have been treated in the past 3 years without evidence of recurrence at the time of
             registration.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia not controlled by pacer device, myocardial infarction within 3 months of
             registration, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days of study entry.
