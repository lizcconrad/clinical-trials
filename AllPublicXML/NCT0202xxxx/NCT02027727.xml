  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which early infliximab pharmacokinetic level is
      most associated with clinical remission at weeks 30 and 54 in pediatric IBD patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our aims are:

        1. to determine which early pk level; week 6 (peak), week 8 (2 week) or week 14 (trough),
           is most associated with week 30 and 54 outcomes in pediatric IBD patients.

        2. to determine if the forecasted PK determined by a newly developed Population PK Model
           software program is in agreement with the observed PK in IBD patients receiving
           infliximab.

      Subject recruitment is limited to patients of the principal investigator only. Subjects will
      be approached for participation in the research in person during a routine clinic visit by a
      member of the study team.

    <description>Determine what level (peak, 2 week or trough) best correlates with clinical remission at week 54
Clinical remission definition: PCDAI &lt; 10 or CDAI &lt; 150 for Crohn's disease, or partial Mayo &lt;2 points and no sub-score &gt; 1 for ulcerative colitis.
Fischer exact testing will be done to determine what detectable IFX level (week 6, week 8 or week 14) is most associated with week 54 clinical remission.
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be performed to determine the median level that is most associated with week 54 clinical remission.
Regression tree analysis will be performed to determine the optimal infliximab level cut point that predicts week 54 clinical remission.</description>

Agreement between pk profiles predicted by the PK model and actual (measured) pk profiles for all patients with at least 6 months in between levels Analysis: Bland Altman test will be used to quantify the agreement between the two methods: Software pk model vs actual measured pk profiles
