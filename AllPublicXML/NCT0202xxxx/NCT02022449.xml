  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore maternal biological (activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and
      behavioral (smoking, sleep behavior, exercise and alcohol use) pathways of
      intervention-related decreases in inflammation. Hypothesis: The intervention group will show
      decreased levels of cortisol and improved health behaviors from pre- to post-intervention
      when compared with the control group. We will also explore whether intervention-related
      changes in these parameters predict symptoms of illness. Exploratory Aim 2. To explore
      psychological pathways of intervention-related decreases in distress among mothers, including
      the perception of social support and the use of behavioral coping strategies that are
      components of the intervention. Hypothesis: Increases in perceived social support and use of
      active behavioral coping strategies will be associated with intervention-related decreases in
      symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological stress.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  biologic, adoptive, or legal guardian mothers of children (birth to 17 years) who are
             within 6 weeks of being newly diagnosed with any cancer, with the exception of a
             central nervous system (CNS) cancer or early stage lymphoma, recruited from the
             Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP)

          -  no reported clinical history of psychotic or bipolar illness, neurological disorder
             (stroke, transient ischemic attacks, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis) or
             chronic disease known to influence immune function, including cardiovascular disease,
             cancer [within the past 2 years], or autoimmune disease

          -  not taking medications that might alter responses to questionnaires or indices of
             immune function (including major sedatives or glucocorticoid, anti-inflammatory,
             anti-retroviral, or immunosuppressant medication)

          -  fluency in English (i.e., have commonly used English in everyday speaking and reading
             for at least 10 years)

          -  is at least 18 years of age

          -  not working nightshifts exclusively.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  mothers of children with CNS cancers due to our belief that a psychosocial
             intervention tailored more specifically to the unique stressors inherent in this
             diagnosis is warranted

          -  mothers of children with early stage lymphomas will be excluded because of their
             child's brief/mild treatment course

          -  mothers whose child is older than 17 years will not be eligible; the upper age limit
             (17 years) was established based on referral patterns at the CHP hematology/oncology
             department.
