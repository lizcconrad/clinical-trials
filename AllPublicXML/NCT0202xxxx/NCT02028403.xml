  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV may have low levels of the virus in their body, even if they are
      taking HIV medications. This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) (which is
      how the body interacts with drugs), and immune response to BMS-936559, a drug that will be
      administered by an intravenous (IV) infusion, in HIV-infected people receiving combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART) who have viral load levels below the limit of detection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV who are taking cART and have low viral load levels may still have
      reservoirs of HIV remaining in their body. BMS-936559 is a drug that has been studied in
      previous clinical trials to treat various types of cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety, PK, and immunotherapeutic activity of a single dose of BMS-936559
      (administered by an IV infusion) in HIV-infected people who are receiving cART and who have
      viral loads below the limit of detection. Researchers will also evaluate whether BMS-936559
      can reduce hidden reservoirs of HIV.

      Participants will be enrolled in four cohorts. Within each cohort, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive BMS-936559 (Cohort 1: 0.3 mg/kg; Cohort 2: 1 mg/kg; Cohort 3: 3
      mg/kg; or Cohort 4: 10 mg/kg) or placebo. The four cohorts will be enrolled sequentially,
      with researchers reviewing safety data of the cohort before enrolling participants in the
      next cohort.

      Prior to study entry, all participants must have an eye exam and an electrocardiogram (ECG).
      At study entry, participants will undergo a medical and medication history review, physical
      examination, an eye exam, and a blood collection. Some female participants will have a
      pregnancy test. All participants will then receive a single IV infusion of their assigned
      dose of BMS-936559 or placebo. The infusion will occur over a period of 60 minutes, and
      participants will remain in the clinic for observation for an additional 12 hours. Additional
      study visits will occur at Days 3, 7, 14, 28, and Weeks 10, 16, 24, 36, and 48. These study
      visits may include a physical examination, blood collection, adherence assessments, and PK
      evaluations. Some participants may have additional eye exams during the study, on an
      as-needed basis.

          -  Intent to use immunomodulators (e.g., IL-2, IL-12, interferons, or tumor necrosis
             factor [TNF] modifiers) during the course of the study

          -  Any vaccination within 30 days prior to screening SCA, pre-entry, or entry.
             Individuals who require vaccination will delay screening SCA until 30 days
             post-vaccination. Alternatively, vaccinations can occur following the screening SCA,
             provided they occur greater than or equal to 30 days prior to pre-entry or entry.

          -  Current HCV antiviral therapy or participants who have received HCV treatment in the
             last 5 years

          -  Positive tuberculosis (TB) purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or
             interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) at screening. NOTE: Participants with a prior
             positive PPD or IGRA who have not completed prophylaxis treatment will be excluded.

          -  Women of reproductive potential. More information on this criterion is available in
             the protocol.

          -  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          -  Type I and type II diabetes mellitus

          -  Participants weighing less than 50 kg or greater than 200 kg. NOTE: For participants
             weighing between 50 kg to 52.9 kg, sites must consult with the A5326 protocol team
             prior to enrollment. The allowable blood volume to be drawn in an 8-week period for
             these participants may be less than participants weighing greater than or equal to 53
             kg.
