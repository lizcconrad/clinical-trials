      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using Fluorescein Sodium and
      the Yellow 560 microscope to aid in treatment of intracranial tumors and vascular lesions.
      The objectives of this study aim to investigate the use of Fluorescein in assisting with
      evaluating complete tumor removal and thorough treatment of intracranial vascular lesions as
      well as tumor biopsy procedures. The hypothesis is that Fluorescein Sodium will help surgeons
      better identify residual tumor and vascular lesions and its use will allow surgeons to obtain
      better surgical results and prognostic outcomes.

    <description>We will perform fluorescein fluorescence/angiography at surgery and assess if fluorescence reveals any residual tumor or vascular lesion (aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or arteriovenous fistula) following surgical intervention. For subjects with brain tumors we will then perform a regular postoperative MRI and assess if there was any residual tumor and measure the accuracy of fluorescein fluorescence to assess the amount of the residual tumor seen on the postoperative MRI. Similarly, for the aneurysms or other vascular lesions, we will perform a regular postoperative angiogram and assess the accuracy of fluorescein angiography results in estimating the amount of residual lesion.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in the study will prepare for surgery as per standard neurosurgical indications, procedures and institution protocols. At the time of the anesthesia induction, with the patient under general anesthesia, Fluorescein Sodium 10% (100mg/1mL) at a dose of 3-20 mg/kg will be administered intravenously (the optimal dosage will be determined within the study as the most minimal dose for adequate visualization will be used). For vascular lesions, fluorescein sodium 10% (100mg/1mL) will be injected and used to assess its application after the conventional methods have confirmed the exclusion of the aneurysm. No patient's care will be affected by the results of the Fluorescein angiography.</description>
