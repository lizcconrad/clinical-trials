  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine menthol smokers' perception, product
      preference, and pattern of use across six products including, mint-flavored nicotine gum;
      non-flavored nicotine gum; mentholated nicotine inhaler; and non-menthol nicotine inhaler.
      Participants will undergo an orientation and baseline assessment followed by a 2-week product
      sampling phase. At the end of the 2 weeks of sampling, subjects will select a product to use
      during the following 2-week smoking cessation phase. This 2-week abstinence phase is followed
      by one week of abrupt withdrawal of the product. This study design was successfully used in a
      study we conducted that examined the smokers' preference for a variety or oral tobacco
      products.

    <description>All subjects will test six different nicotine replacement products over the course of the 2-week product sampling phase. The six nicotine replacement products being tested are non-flavored 2mg nicotine gum, non-flavored 4mg nicotine gum, mint-flavored 2mg nicotine gum, mint-flavored 4mg nicotine gum, non-flavored nicotine inhaler and mint-flavored inhaler. The order in which the subjects test these products will be randomized and subjects will be blinded to the nicotine content of the product but will be instructed about the flavor of the product.</description>
