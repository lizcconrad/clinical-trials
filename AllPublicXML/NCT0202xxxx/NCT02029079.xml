  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition increases the risk of complications and predisposes ti infections through
      impaired immune response and wound healing. Healthcare costs related to the management of
      malnourished patients is estimated to be more than double the amount spent managing non-
      malnourished

      The objective of this study is to examine the effect of newly developed energy and
      nutrients-dense beverage product on the nutritional status among patients at risk of
      malnutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a complex state described as a deficiency of energy, protein and other
      nutrients causing measurable adverse effect on body tissue, function and clinical outcome.

      Oral nutritional supplementation has in multiple individual trials and meta-analyzes shown an
      increased total energy intake and protein intake in patients in hospital settings as well as
      in the community.

      The largest producer of dairy products in Norway, TINE AS released a new milk based energy-
      and nutrient dense product, called E+. The initiative behind this was Haukeland University
      Hospital and the municipality of Bergen. The product were developed to prevent malnutrition
      in the elderly and patients with a low food intake and high energy requirements.

      The overall contribution to this study will be to provide new insight on how to offer
      malnourished patients the best available treatment.

    <time_frame>Assessment at day 0, 35 and 70.</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength will be measured in kg with a handgrip dynamometer. Subjects will be asked to perform a maximal contraction for a few seconds with the non-dominant hand three times with about 10-20 seconds between each trial.</description>

    <measure>Change in Body weight</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0, 35 and 70</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to remove shoes, socks, heavy clothing and jewelry for measurement of body weight to the nearest 100 g using portable digital scales.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0, 35 and 70</time_frame>
    <description>A Bioelectric impedance analysis will be used to calculate change in body composition. Measurements will be conducted by a device sending weak electric signals through the participant's body. The method is non-invasive and is commonly used by medical, health and fitness professionals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nutritional intake</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0, 35 and 70</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be assessed for each study participant using a twenty-four-hour recall method conducted by the investigator and two additional people employed to help with the data collection. All three data collectors will use a standardized interview. The data collected will be used to calculate daily calorie and protein intake by entering the food records into a computerized version of a food composition table, Dietist XP.</description>
