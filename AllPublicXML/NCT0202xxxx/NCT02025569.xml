    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of Strain Counterstrain (SCS) on dynamic balance and
      subjective sense of instability in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Although
      many studies have been published on CAI, the cause for this common clinical dysfunction
      remains inconclusive. No studies have assessed the effectiveness of SCS on CAI. Baseline
      information on all participants includes a demographic questionnaire, the Star Excursion
      Balance Test (SEBT), and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). Participants were
      randomized into the SCS intervention group or the sham SCS control group. All participants
      received an intervention (as assigned) once a week for four weeks in addition to performing a
      prescribed home exercise program. At week four all participants repeated the outcome measures
      and completed a Global Rating of Change (GROC) form. The primary aim was examined with a
      2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
