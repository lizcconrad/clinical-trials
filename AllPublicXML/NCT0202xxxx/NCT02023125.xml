  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-group study will investigate the effect of food (Group 1) and esomeprazole (Group 2)
      on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of alectinib in healthy volunteers.

      Participants in Group 1 will be randomly assigned to a two period treatment sequence (AB or
      BA) in which they will receive a single, oral dose of alectinib per period separated by at
      least 10 days. Each participant will receive single, oral doses alectinib given under fasted
      conditions (Treatment A) or following the ingestion of a high fat, high calorie meal
      (Treatment B) as determined by their assigned sequence.

      Participants in Group 2 will be given a single, oral dose of alectinib following a standard
      meal. After a washout period of at least 10 days, they will receive an oral dose of
      esomeprazole (40 mg) once daily for 6 days. On the 6th day of esomeprazole administration, a
      single, oral dose alectinib will be given after ingestion of a standard meal.

      In all groups, pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the 4 days following alectinib
      administration.

          <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
