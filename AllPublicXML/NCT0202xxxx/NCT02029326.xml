      Prometheus's Onco dX assay platform provides technological breakthrough for immunoassay by
      obtaining a level of sensitivity down to single tumor cells without compromising specificity.
      This allows assessment of multiple TKI treatment targets, their activation status, as well as
      down stream signaling proteins using very tiny amount of tissue that can be obtained by FNA
      or CTCs.

      We planned this study to explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to
      cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer using the Prometheus Platform. We
      will also elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to cetuximab resistance, monitor
      changes in the RTK activation status during cetuximab treatment using circulating tumor cells
      and analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and treatment
      response to cetuximab.
