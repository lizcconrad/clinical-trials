  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide better care and preventive services for people with both depression and diabetes,
      the investigators propose to develop and test whether interventions to reduce depressive
      symptoms can be integrated into routine diabetes clinics in India. The investigators will
      gather feedback from patients in India through focus group discussions and individual
      interviews so they can culturally-adapt a model of combined depression and diabetes care. The
      investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and costs of this care model in a trial at
      three diabetes clinics in India. It is expected that results from this study can guide how to
      incorporate mental health care into routine diabetes clinics in low-resource settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that targeting both depression and diabetes control has important
      synergistic benefits. Since diabetes patients in India tend to access specialists (government
      or private) for their diabetes and other health care needs, they at least have a point of
      contact with the health system which can be leveraged to also reduce depressive symptoms. The
      investigators aim to assess if interventions for depression can be integrated into routine
      diabetes care delivery with only modest modifications. The integrated multi-condition
      (depression and diabetes) intervention model merges experiences from TEAMCare and an ongoing
      trial of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in India (CARRS Trial) and involves: 1.
      enhancing the role of care coordinators and training them in disease management; 2.
      integrating 'intelligent' technology; and 3. weekly physician oversight to review
      poorly-controlled cases and make responsive treatment adjustments. The investigators propose
      to take this model from research to practice using an implementation sciences approach. The
      investigators will first gather formative qualitative data and endeavor to make the
      intervention more patient-centered, develop locally-understandable educational materials, and
      identify ways to overcome stigma of mental health disorders and facilitate trustful
      therapeutic relationships between care coordinators and patients and their families. The
      investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention
      model in a randomized controlled trial.

    <description>To stimulate and motivate sustained, effective self-care, patient education materials and behavioral activation techniques that are adapted for the Indian population will be used by care coordinators. Behavioral activation strategies are brief, structured psychological interventions that are based on extensive theoretical and clinical literature, can be delivered by non-specialist providers, can be combined with antidepressant medications, and emphasize reinforcing behaviors to produce improvements in thoughts, mood, and quality of life.</description>

    <description>Care coordinators will: (a) meet with intervention arm patients and collaboratively set treatment goals; (b) provide verbal education regarding diabetes and depression self-care ;(c) will use motivational interviewing and self-efficacy enhancement strategies to promote monitoring of depressive symptoms, glucose, BP; (d) will proactively follow-up to externally monitor depression symptoms and CVD indicators; (e) will enter updated patient indicators into decision-support electronic health record and utilize software outputs to prioritize patients for review; (g) will convene case review meetings with supervising physicians; and (h) will communicate physician-recommended treatment changes to patients and their routine providers.</description>

    <description>Senior psychiatrist and endocrinologist/diabetologist will be involved in weekly offline case review meetings with care coordinators. Case review meetings will be structured: the decision-support electronic health record will help prioritize cases that are new (within 3 weeks of randomization); have moderate/severe depression symptoms (based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9) ≥6 weeks after most recent treatment changes, or continued poor HbA1c, home glucose, BP, or LDL-c control in past 4 weeks; or have not been reviewed for 3 months. Based on patient indicators and current therapies, physicians will recommend treatment changes (initiation, increases, or simplification of medication regimens) which will be communicated by care coordinators to patientsand their usual care providers.</description>

    <description>The decision-support electronic health record will store patient indicators entered by the Nurse Case Managers (NCM) and provide diabetes and depression care prompts based on an evidence-based treatment algorithm developed from recommended guidelines for control of diabetes and depression, Indian formularies, and TeamCare investigators. The decision-supported electronic health record (DS-EHR) will prioritize patients (new; poorly-controlled; or well-controlled but not reviewed ≥3 months) for case review meetings and promote accountability (physicians must justify rejecting electronic care prompts).</description>
