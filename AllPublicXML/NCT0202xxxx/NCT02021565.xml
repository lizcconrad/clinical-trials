    <textblock>
      The CG ASSIST Project is a four-year study for older Veterans with transfer impairments and
      informal caregivers. CG ASSIST is an in-home training program for dyads designed to teach
      Veterans how to safely, skillfully, and (when possible) independently perform Activities of
      Daily Living involving transfers. Experts (OTs) who provide this training will also
      recommend, provide, and install assistive technology devices such as grab bars, bed rails,
      and toileting aids as needed. Research assistants conduct home visits with the dyads pre and
      post intervention to determine the effects of the program on Veteran and caregiver quality of
      life measures (burden, depression, task efficacy, lifespace).

      Half of the couples in this study will receive the training from the expert remotely through
      a tele-video conferencing device. Research assistants will bring the device to participants'
      homes and assist in the training session.

      Introduction and Objective: The primary objective of the proposed four-year randomized,
      controlled trial is to document that providing a hands-on skills training and assistive
      technology (AT)/environmental modification program for older Veterans who are dependent in
      activities of daily living (ADLs) and their informal caregivers will result in improvements
      in caregiving processes (i.e., caregiving skills) and outcomes (i.e., safety during tasks)
      compared to the current standard of care and have beneficial direct and indirect effects for
      both members of the dyad. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of the program on
      Veteran and caregiver subjective well-being (depression, quality of life) and to compare the
      relative effectiveness of two validated implementation modalities the traditional in-person
      approach and real-time interactive tele-video conferencing.

      Research Plan. The study will be conducted with older Veterans (&gt;60yrs) with mobility
      impairments who live in the community and are dependent on an informal caregiver for ADL
      assistance involving mobility, transfer or positional change. The study will utilize a
      modified randomized controlled cross-over design with four study arms and three or four
      outcome assessment periods. Prior to the first home visit, participants will be randomized to
      an intervention modality (in-person vs. tele-video) then randomized within those groups to an
      immediate intervention (IIG) or delayed intervention/control group (DICG).

      Methods. In-home interviews will be completed with 180 Veteran caregiving dyads to obtain
      baseline, self-reported measures of caregiving needs, processes and outcomes using
      standardized, validated instruments. In-home visits by an Assistive Technology Specialist
      (ATS) will mirror the interview visits (within 1 week) to independently and objectively
      assess needs through observation of functional tasks. Dyads will be re-evaluated one (T2),
      two (T3), and four to five (T4) months later to ascertain change. Following T1 assessments,
      those in the IIG will receive 2 additional home visits from the ATS to (1) deliver the
      intervention and (2) reinforce the intervention. A 2nd blinded ATS will conduct the T2
      outcome assessments. At T2 an ATS will conduct observation-based assessments which will also
      serve as a repeat baseline for the DICG. The intervention schedule will then be repeated for
      dyads in the DICG during T3. The final assessments for both groups will be collected 3 months
      after the intervention during T4.

      Intervention. The Caregiver Assessment of Skill Sets &amp; Individualized Support Thru Training
      or CG ASSIST program has recently undergone feasibility testing in a VA RR&amp;D pilot study.

      The intervention consists of (a) provision of assistive technology (AT) and simple home
      modifications to facilitate ADLs and (b) dyad training on the appropriate use of the devices
      and proper task execution using standardized protocols individualized to the needs and
      preferences of the dyad and environmental features of the home.

      Clinical Relevance. Supporting and assisting caregivers in providing care for Veterans to
      help them age in place has important implications for the VHA system and the safety, dignity
      and quality of life of the Veterans we serve.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was a wait list control design. Participating couples were either assigned to the intervention group and received the full CG ASSIST program (assessment, observation, recommendations, equipment, modifications, and training) or were assigned to the delayed intervention control group (assessment and observation only). Then, as the intervention group was evaluated, the delayed intervention control group received the full CG ASSIST program. Both groups received 3-month follow-up observations and assessments. Results are reported for Baseline to T1 Intervention and Control.</intervention_model_description>

In-home Training and Provision of Assistive Technology (prn): Assistive Technology Specialists (ATSs), experts on assistive technology devices and how to performing transfer tasks, train Veteran and caregiver dyads to safely, skillfully, and (when appropriate) independently perform four activities of daily living (ADLs): transferring in and out of bed, toileting, and bathing. During the baseline assessments, ATSs also recommend assistive technology equipment (grab bars, bed rails, raised toilet seats, etc.), environmental modifications, adaptive methods, and energy conservation techniques. On the first day of the intervention, ATSs provide and install recommended equipment and train the dyad to complete the three ADLs using the recommended the modified methods.</description>

Efficacy in task completion reported both with assistance from the informal caregiver and performed independently by the Veteran. Scores range from 10-100 with higher scores reflecting greater transfer efficacy.</description>
