  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention tested in this research project aims to reduce this inequality by improving
      the management of elderly head and neck cancer patients with a specific management. Indeed,
      the treatment of elderly head and neck cancer patients has specificities concerning treatment
      options, their tolerance, psychological management, nutritional and functional status, and
      support needed at home. To assess the overall needs of the elderly patients, an assessment
      known as &quot;comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot; (CGA) can be performed by a geriatrician with
      extensive testing and questionnaires. This assessment is long and requires an experienced
      geriatrician. It leads to the development of an individualized treatment plan (physiotherapy,
      psychological follow-up, support at home, nutritional management ...) and follow-up to adapt
      the necessary cares for the duration of the cancer treatment. The CGA utility has been
      studied in elderly patients with nonmalignant diseases. Studies have shown that CGA allowed
      improving survival and maintaining the elderly at home.

      Context: The survival of elderly patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
      cancer is greatly reduced compared to younger subjects. Several explanations have been
      proposed : a competitive comorbidity, a more frequent refusal of standard therapy or the
      choice of a suboptimal treatment due to fear of toxicities. The comprehensive geriatric
      assessment (CGA) may influence the decision-making process and help for managing elderly
      patients with head and neck cancer. The CGA is a multidimensional assessment of general
      health status, using validated scales. It produces an inventory of problems which can then
      serve to develop an individualized geriatric intervention plan of care and follow-up.

      Hypotheses: We postulate that the CGA and the geriatric follow-up improves 1) the therapeutic
      decision-making process thanks to a better assessment of the patient's functional reserve and
      its capacity to support or not the treatment, and 2) the overall survival, the functional
      status and the nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC because of a more
      appropriate treatment and a personalized medical follow-up after surgery and/or radiotherapy
      and/or chemotherapy or more rarely targeted therapy, with adjustment of treatments and
      management of comorbidities and/or treatment complications.

      Main objective: To assess the impact of the CGA and the geriatric follow-up on the overall
      survival, the functional status and the nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC.

      Secondary objectives: To assess the impact of the CGA on the therapeutic decision, the
      toxicity and/or complications of treatment, the complete realization of treatment, the
      autonomy, the institutionalization, the total hospitalization stay, the quality of life of
      elderly patients with HNSCCs and the costs.
