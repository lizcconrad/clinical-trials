      The aim of this study is to assess the benefit of GYNEFFIK®, a perineal electro-stimulator,
      during this home-care phase. Women with stress urinary incontinence (UI) or with mixed UI
      (composed predominantly of stress UI), that responded to physiotherapy were included in this
      study in two parallel groups. The groups followed a self-reeducation program, with or without
      GYNEFFIK® electro-stimulation sessions. The comparison of the two groups was based on the
      rate of women for whom the benefit of the initial perineal reeducation was maintained.

    <measure>Non-Worsening of ICIQ + Ditrovie Scales' Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months (or last measurement if premature ending)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is defined as the non worsening of the ICIQ (International Consultation on Incontinence modular Questionnaire) scale's score AND the DITROVIE scale's score (a specific scale to evaluate the perturbation of the quality of life during urinary troubles).
The scores will be considered as maintained if they didn't increase more than 10% with the following calculation:
ICIQ variation (%) = 100 x (ICIQ_M6 - ICIQ_D0)/ICIQ_D0
DITROVIE variation (%) = 100 x (DITROVIE_M6 - DITROVIE_D0)/(DITROVIE_D0 -10)</description>

The following items will be compared between D0 and M6: normal urinary episodes, incontinence episodes and drinks, in number and volume.
