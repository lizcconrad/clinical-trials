  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two routes in which a fiberoptic intubation can be performed - oral and nasal. In
      general, nasal intubation by any conventional method may be the preferred choice for certain
      procedures such as intra-oral surgeries, or for anatomical reasons such as limited mouth
      opening. If nasal intubation is not indicated or preferred, then oral intubation is usually
      performed.

      This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the
      ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children
      less than or equal to 2 years of age. This study will also examine if operator experience
      influence time to tracheal intubation with either route?

      The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route of fiberoptic intubation will be faster
      than the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal
      differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation.

      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare the effect of nasal fiberoptic
      intubation versus oral fiberoptic intubation in children less than 2 years of age. Other
      factors that will be assesed include operator experience, the ease and time for fiberoptic
      grade of laryngeal view, time for fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and complications.

      This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the
      ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children
      less than or equal to 2 years of age. While also asking, will operator experience influence
      time to tracheal intubation with either route?

      The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route fiberoptic intubation will be faster than
      the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal
      differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation.
