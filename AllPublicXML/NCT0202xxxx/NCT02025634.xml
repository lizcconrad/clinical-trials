  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, placebo controlled, single blind study is to determine if
      postoperative pain levels, as measured by a verbal numeric pain rating scale (VNRS), are
      reduced with the administration of IV acetaminophen when compared to a control group.
      Particular focus will be on the postoperative opioid consumption. In addition, we will
      ascertain if the total time the participant is in the PACU differs in those who receive the
      IV acetaminophen versus those who do not.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, single blind study of intravenous (IV)
      acetaminophen in a postoperative arthroscopy patient population. Although use of this
      medication as a non-narcotic analgesia has been validated in other patient populations such
      as post operative pelvic and abdominal surgeries, it has not been demonstrated in those who
      have recently undergone knee arthroscopy with or without chondroplasty. In this study all
      participants will be injected with a standard of care intra-articular dose of ropivacaine
      HCl, .2% (Naropin) prior to transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Each will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive IV acetaminophen in 100ml of 0.9% NS (treatment group) or a 100 ml
      0.9 % NS placebo (control).

      The PACU nursing staff will periodically ascertain the participants' pain scores on a 0-10
      scale. All other pain medication or related treatment will be recorded. Statistical analysis
      will be done to determine if there is a difference in pain scores between the treatment
      versus control group. Further evaluation will examine if opioid consumption and total time in
      PACU differs between groups.
