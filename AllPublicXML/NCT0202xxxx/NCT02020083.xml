      The purposes of this study are to determine whether transporters expression levels and drug
      interaction between TDF and FTC could contribute to modulate the placental transfer of this
      drug or. To test this hypothesis, an ex vivo model known as &quot;the perfused ex vivo cotyledon
      model&quot; allows to reproduce the conditions of the third trimester of pregnancy

      Nowadays, mother-to-child HIV transmission is the main cause of paediatric HIV infections.
      Yet, this way of transmission is effectively limited by the use of antiretroviral therapies
      during pregnancy in HIV infected women. The study TEmAA (ANRS 12109) we conducted allowed us
      to suggest a therapeutic scheme of administration of the association tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) - emtricitabine (FTC) to reduce the risk of postpartum resistance that may
      occur with the administration of a single dose of nevirapine before delivery. However, we
      also observed a large interindividual variability of TDF in vivo placental transfer that
      remained unexplained. Placental membrane transporters, including efflux transporters
      belonging the ABC transporter superfamily and uptake transporters, may constitute a source of
      variability. In this case, we showed such an association for maraviroc with a significant
      inverse correlation between its clearance index and the placental expression level of several
      efflux transporters of the ABCC/MRP family. Regarding TDF, it has been shown that this drug
      is a substrate of several efflux transporters (ABCC2/MRP2, ABCC4/MRP4, ABCC10/MRP7) and an
      uptake transporter (hOAT3). As these transporters are expressed on the placental barrier, it
      may be hypothesized that their expression levels could contribute to modulate the placental
      transfer of this drug. To test this hypothesis, an ex vivo model known as &quot;the perfused ex
      vivo cotyledon model&quot; allows to reproduce the conditions of the third trimester of pregnancy.
      Our first aim is to evaluate the potential effect of ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCC10 and hOAT3 placental
      expression on TDF placental transfer (First year). We also want to investigate whether a
      potential interaction between TDF and FTC could take part to variability.

    <description>Placental villi were extracted To study the expression level of transporters that may affect the placental transfer. Gene expression was evaluated for each sample using the cycle threshold value (CT), defined as the fraction cycle number at which the fluorescence generated by SYBR green dye-amplicon complex formation passes a fixed threshold above the baseline.</description>

      Tissue samples will be collected. The expression levels of several efflux transporters
      (ABCC2/MRP2, ABCC4/MRP4, ABCC10/MRP7) and an uptake transporter (hOAT3) will be determined to
      explain the variability of placental transfer.
