  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapy is indispensable for the prevention of stent thrombosis in patients who
      underwent coronary artery stenting. Similarly, anticoagulant therapy is essential for the
      prevention of cardiogenic embolism including cerebral infarction in AF patients. However, the
      combined antithrombotic therapy has been reported to increase the risk of major bleeding for
      AF patients after coronary stenting, New anticoagulant drugs that hardly interact with other
      drugs and do not need frequent blood tests have become commonly used. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the hypothesis that Rivaroxaban is non-inferior to Warfarin in the
      efficacy and safety for AF patients after coronary stenting.
