      The treatment protocol consisted of 12 mg/m2 MITO intravenous infusions every 3 months for 2
      years. Dosage was adjusted according to side effects. Neurological assessment including the
      determination of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and ophthalmologic
      evaluations were performed every 3 months and during relapses. Flow cytometric analysis,
      brain and spinal cord MRI was performed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

    <description>For refractory NMO patients aged 18-55, the initial dose 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone was administered over a five day course every 3 months for 2 years (a total of eight courses). The initial dose was reduced to 9 mg/m2 if the preinfusion white-blood-cell count was 3.0-3.99 ×109/L,and to 6 mg/m2 if the white-blood-cell count was 2.0-2.99 ×109/L. No infusion if the white-blood-cell count was less than 2.0×109/L. The initial dose was reduced to 10 mg/m2 for nonhaematological toxic effects of WHO grade 2-3. Subsequent dose after 3 month was reduced to 10 mg/m2 for infections that occurred within 3 weeks of a previous infusion accompanied by a white-blood-cell count below 2×109/L, or to 8 mg/m2 for infections accompanied by white-blood-cell count of less than 1×109/L.</description>
