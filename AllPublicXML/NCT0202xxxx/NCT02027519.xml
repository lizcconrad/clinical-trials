    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information needed to develop a large prevention trial
      to decrease risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission among HIV-discordant
      couples (where one person is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative) in Lesotho. The
      protocol team would like to explore new strategies for increasing the number of partners who
      receive an HIV test and whether this increase in testing also results in identifying
      HIV-discordant couples. These couples would be the focus of the future large prevention
      trial, therefore it is critical that the protocol team explore effective strategies for
      identifying and recruiting these couples. Men and women (index participants) who are
      attending Antenatal Care (ANC),Tuberculosis (TB) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics
      will be recruited for this study. If they agree to take part, a testing team will visit their
      household and offer all adults staying in the house the opportunity to conduct a self-test
      for HIV. Seventy-ﬁve index participants will be enrolled into the study and have their homes
      visited by the testing team. The number of household members tested will depend on the number
      of people living in each household.

      In Lesotho, a country with estimated 16% discordance among heterosexual couples, reaching
      male partners and couples in order to engage them in HIV testing to enable identiﬁcation of
      discordant couples is an important ﬁrst step for any HIV prevention and treatment efforts.

      This is a feasibility study of the use of home-based HIV self-testing of partners and
      household members of individuals recruited from select Antenatal Care (ANC), Tuberculosis
      (TB) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in Lesotho. This study uses an observational
      design to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV
      testing of partners and the effectiveness of this intervention to identify HIV discordant
      couples. It is hypothesized that a home-based self-testing intervention will increase the
      number of partners testing for HIV and will result in increased identiﬁcation of newly
      diagnosed HIV-discordant couples, the target population of the planned Enhanced Prevention in
      Couples (EPIC) study.

      Primary objectives of this study include:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV testing
           of partners of index participants

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of home-based partner self-testing strategies to identify
           HIV-discordant couples

        3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV testing
           of other household members of index participants

      Seventy-ﬁve men and women (index participants) will be recruited from antenatal, TB and ART
      clinics. HIV testing teams will visit index participant households and offer home-based HIV
      testing to all adult household members.

    <description>Index participants who have tested positive for HIV will be provided with information regarding the importance of HIV testing for their partners and other household members and the role of home-based self-testing in potentially increasing the number of partners and household members tested for HIV. In addition, index participants will be counseled about ways in which to talk to partners and household members about HIV testing and provided with information sheets that can be distributed within the household. Lastly, index participants will be introduced to a member of the &quot;testing team&quot; that will present at their home and offer the study intervention.</description>

    <description>Partners of the index participants and other household members will be offered HIV self-testing by the mobile &quot;testing team&quot;. Those who consent to HIV self-testing with SCT confirmation will complete the following procedures:
Undergo standardized pre-test counseling and demonstration of use of HIV rapid test kit by trained study staff, including how to determine test results
Self-administer HIV rapid test and read test results
Provide study staff with self-testing result
Undergo confirmatory testing as well as post-test counseling by study staff (SCT) if the initial self-test is positive, there is any doubt about the results, or the test reveals couple discordance</description>

      HIV rapid tests will be conducted using self-collected oral mucosa transudate. These tests
      use oral ﬂuid and do not require blood drawing. Oral swab samples will not be stored.
      Following the completion of the self-testing, study staff will conduct conﬁrmatory standard
      HIV testing.

      Following self-testing procedures, conﬁrmatory rapid testing will be conducted using whole
      blood ﬁnger-stick. Blood samples from confirmatory tests will not be stored. If there is a
      discrepancy between the two tests, the individual will be counseled and referred for re-test
      in 4-6 weeks.
