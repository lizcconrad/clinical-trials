      Description of the phenomena &quot;Slow Coronary Flow&quot; (SCF), according to the data that has been
      collected from patients hospitalized with specific criteria. Clinical follow-up of these
      patients to determine whether they suffered from any cardial or psychological disorders that
      might be a result of SCF.
