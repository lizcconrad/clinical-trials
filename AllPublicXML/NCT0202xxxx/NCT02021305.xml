    <textblock>
      Purpose So far anatomical abnormalities (mostly congenital) were, in the majority of the
      patients, associated with urinary track infections. In this study the researchers will try to
      investigate the role of TLRs as molecular interactions between bacterial virulence and host
      response.

      TLRs are important mediators in the development of the natural immunity against bacteria.
      They recognize microbial pathogen associated molecular patterns and alert the host's immune
      system to the presence of invading microbes

      The aim of his observational case-control study is to :

        1. investigate if the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mediate in the development of the natural
           immunity of the uroepithileal cells against bacteria.

        2. evaluate the effect of the TLR-gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms on the
           development and clinical severity of urinary tract infections (UTI) in children.

        3. determine the association of the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 and TLR-4 polymorphisms
           with the formation of renal scar in children.

        4. investigate the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 and TLR-4 polymorphisms in healthy
           children and elaborate the results to the possible carriers of these polymorphisms.
