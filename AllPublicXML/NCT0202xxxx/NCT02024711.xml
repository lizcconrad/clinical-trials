    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical study is to determine the
      safety and effectiveness of the EYEFILL® C.-US Viscoelastic in patients undergoing cataract
      extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation surgery.

      EYEFILL® C.-US Viscoelastic is designed to create and maintain space, to protect the corneal
      endothelium and other intraocular tissues, and to manipulate tissues during surgery.

      EYEFILL® C.-US Viscoelastic may also be used to coat intraocular lenses and instruments
      during cataract extraction and intraocular lens insertion.
