    <textblock>
      One of the problems during general anesthesia (GA) for caesarean section is the place of
      opioid agents. Indeed, the literature does not provide so far a clear answer regarding the
      use of opioids prior to extraction of the newborn. Indeed, if the opioid administration at
      induction is beneficial for the mother (better control of autonomic responses to noxious
      stimuli), the impact on the newborn can be unfavorable in terms of adaptation to extrauterine
      life . This is especially true if the birth takes place in a context of prematurity and / or
      acute fetal distress.

      The pharmacokinetics of remifentanil make it the only opioid which is consistent with a rapid
      sequence induction. Its short period of action avoids the manual ventilation of patients
      before intubation, while providing a peak of action concomitant to the nociceptive
      stimulation. Patients at high risk of aspiration, including pregnant women, may benefit from
      this type of morphine at induction. In addition, the fact that remifentanil seems to be
      associated with relative fetal safety in obstetrical or neonatal context legitimized the
      development of protocols to study maternal-fetal consequences of the use of remifentanil at
      induction of AG for emergency caesarean section.

      While cesarean section under general anesthesia mainly concern premature newborns in France,
      no work has focused on the use of remifentanil for caesarean section in a context of preterm
      without preeclampsia.

      The main hypothesis of this study is to evaluate the safety of the use of remifentanil in
      terms of adaptation to extrauterine life in children born prematurely by caesarean section
      under general anesthesia outside the context of preeclampsia.

      To do this, we will compare two groups of children, one consisting of children born by
      cesarean section under general anesthesia with maternal remifentanil infusion, the other made
      up of children born by cesarean section under general anesthesia without maternal infusion of
      remifentanil. This study is prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded.

      The primary endpoint is formed by the value of the Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes,
      calculated in the delivery room by the team supporting the child (midwives and
      pediatricians).

      The secondary endpoints are formed by maternal hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, HR),
      the rate of complications during induction (difficult intubation, aspiration), the onset of
      respiratory distress requiring ventilation mask in the newborn, the rate of intubation in
      neonates, and the rate of use of adjuvant anesthetic agents.
