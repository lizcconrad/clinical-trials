  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use PET/MRI in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to identify
      hidden metastatic disease or identify patients with borderline or locally advanced disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a PET/MRI scan within 6 weeks of their standard of care imaging. There
      is no maximum number of scans for research. The number of scans depends on each patient's
      treatment plan.

    <time_frame>Up to several months or longer. Patient will undergo research imaging with each standard of care scan they have.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is to determine if the primary tumor and the margins of anatomical land marks from the PET/MRI imaging is more precise and gives a clearer picture of tumor location than standard care, CT or MRI. Both standard of care imaging and this new technology will be compared to the final pathologic analysis, measuring the true distance (in mm) between the primary tumor and margins. Data will be reported as mm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <description>The secondary outcome is to determine if PET/MRI imaging is better than standard of care imaging (CT or MRI) after patients have received chemotherapy and to determine if they are surgical candidates. The objective is to determine if the primary tumor and the margins of anatomical land marks from the PET/MRI imaging is more precise and gives a clearer picture of tumor location than standard care, CT or MRI. Both standard of care imaging and this new technology will be compared to the final pathologic analysis, measuring the true distance (in mm) between the primary tumor and margins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of suspicious lesion of the pancreas consistent with pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma. Cytological confirmation is not required.

          -  Patients preparing to receive therapy for pancreas cancer, including patients enrolled
             in NCT01413022

          -  Patient must be 18 years or older

          -  Patient must have a life expectancy of more than 6 months and performance status of 2
             or less

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an approved written informed
             consent document

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior
             to study entry and for the length of the study

          -  Patients enrolled in the Clinical trials.gov# NCT01413022 trial must meet both studies
             eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have had prior resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patient must not have a history of other malignancy less than or equal to 5 years
             previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which
             were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patient must not be unable to receive a PET-MRI scan due to renal function, allergy or
             other problem with receiving or tolerating an MRI scan, etc. All patients will fill
             out a standard MRI screening form.

          -  Patients must not have a blood glucose of greater than or equal to 200mg/dL at the
             time of PET-MRI or if a patient is diabetic and glucose is not controlled. At the
             discretion of the PI and the authorized user and with their approval prior to
             2-[18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) injection, patients with blood glucose â‰¥ 200
             mg/dL may participate in the study.

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breast feeding
