  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant increases in global health investment and the availability of low-cost,
      efficacious interventions designed to reduce mother to child HIV transmission in low and
      middle income countries with high HIV burden, the translation of these scientific advances
      into effective delivery strategies has been slow, uneven and incomplete. As a result,
      pediatric HIV infection remains largely uncontrolled. Enhancing the implementation of pMTCT
      interventions through contextually appropriate systems analysis and improvement approaches
      can potentially reduce drop-offs along the pMTCT cascade, leading to dramatic improvements in
      infant and maternal outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to develop a model for systematic
      assessment and improvement of pMTCT services in sub-Saharan Africa. In specific aim 1, we
      will identify health system factors and service delivery approaches associated with high and
      low performing pMTCT services in C么te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Mozambique. In specific aim 2 we
      will adapt evaluate the feasibility and impact of a systems analysis tool and associated
      performance enhancement approach for pMTCT services in C么te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Mozambique.
      This systems analysis tool and associated performance enhancement approach is currently being
      developed and piloted for pMTCT services in Mozambique. The results of this implementation
      research are expected to generate knowledge of global health significance, and by
      disseminating the study results and intervention tools through the broad PEPFAR network, can
      rapidly impact pMTCT service delivery enhancements across the highest need countries.
