    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a functional bioactive
      supplement associated with a hypocaloric equilibrated diet to treat obese and overweight
      individuals. The functional bioactive supplement, containing antioxidant extracted from
      rosemary, oligosaccharides derived from lactulose and bioactive peptides, was developed to
      satiety control, improves of anti-inflammatory response and antioxidant defense mechanisms as
      well as to weight loss.

      A randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled was performed to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect of a functional bioactive supplement associated with a hypocaloric equilibrated diet
      to treatment of obesity and overweight.

      Women aged between 18 and 65 years with obesity and overweight diagnosis (IMC &gt;25&lt;35 kg/m2)
      were included in the study. The clinical trial will be performed in the Clinical Nutrition
      Department of La Paz University Hospital, in Madrid. All of the volunteers will receive a
      dietetic treatment with 1500 Kcal/day and physical activity recommendations during the study.
