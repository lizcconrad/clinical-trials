      Identify a biologic (molecular) basis for the increased susceptibility of cigarette smokers
      to pulmonary TB (Mtb) by testing the hypothesis that smoking reprograms AM polarization
      towards a distinct phenotype associated with impaired host defense function against Mtb and
      that normalization of that phenotype via therapeutic modulation of the Alveolar Macrophage
      (AM) polarization or smoking cessation can restore the anti-Mtb host defense function of AM.

      Samples from Non-Smokers with TB, Smokers with TB and Smokers with COPD and TB will be
      collected in Qatar under JIRB 14-00055. All subjects will be undergoing a clinical
      bronchoscopy as part of their disease evaluation and will be asked to give additional samples
      for research. All &quot;in vivo&quot; processing of specimens from subjects with TB will be performed
      in Qatar. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Mtb) continues to have a detrimental impact
      of public health worldwide. Based on the epidemiological evidence linking smoking, COPD and
      Mtb, and our preliminary data we hypothesize that smoking reprograms Alveolar Macrophages
      (AM) polarization towards a distinct phenotype associated with impaired host defense function
      against Myobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and that normalization of that phenotype via
      therapeutic modulation of the Alveolar Macrophages (AM) polarization or smoking cessation can
      restore the anti-Mtb host defense function of AM.

        Recruitment will be from the referral base of the responsible investigator and other
        physicians, and review of admissions and hospital database. Patients, who may qualify for
        this study, will be identified by chart review, physician referral, and recruited by study
        investigators. The source of potential subjects will be the population of potential
        subjects with TB (smokers or non smokers), and with both TB and COPD, as defined before.
        Accrual will be random with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group.
