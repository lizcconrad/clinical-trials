  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There were many studies which examined the availability of inverted gray-scale chest X-ray
      for increasing the detection of lung nodules. In emergency medicine, rib fracture is an
      important part for patient's disposition, so investigators designed this study to evaluate
      the availability of inverted gray-scale chest X-ray for the detection of rib fracture.
