  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to optimise physical activity interventions to help previously
      inactive women improve their body shape and composition. Many people seeking to lose weight
      or improve body composition initiate an exercise programme. The most common recommendation of
      an exercise intervention for someone attempting to manage their weight, has been to
      'prescribe' the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week (World Health Organisation),
      often using one mode of exercise. An alternative approach might be to offer a portfolio of
      activities, from which the exerciser can pick and choose, to facilitate greater amounts of
      physical activity. The problem with this is how do you account for the different intensities
      of walking, washing the car, playing badminton, cycling, jogging, etc? In this study, the
      investigators will try to overcome this barrier by allocating a number of &quot;physical activity
      points&quot; to each activity. Using this physical activity points system, participants will be
      provided with a points target that they can meet using any combination of activities.

      The investigators research aim is therefore to compare this points-based system against the
      traditional 5x30minute prescription (and sedentary control) for their ability to help
      previously inactive women to drop a dress size, increase fat burning, positively change their
      body composition and tone their tummy.

    <description>Participants will be asked to choose one activity and stick to it for the duration of the intervention. Participants will be able to choose between brisk walking/slow jogging or cycling. The intervention will require the completion of 30 minutes of chosen activity on 5 days of the week, which will be recorded in a physical activity diary.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be asked to achieve a pre-set, individualised points target for physical activity each week. Points are acquired through the completion of a minimum 10 minutes of activity, choosing from the extensive list of activities provided; for example, 10 minutes of jogging achieves 4.5 points, whereas 10 minutes of washing a car achieves 1.5 points. The target will be 35-40 points per week, which equates to approximately 6 points per day. Any combination of activity, duration and frequency can be selected.</description>
