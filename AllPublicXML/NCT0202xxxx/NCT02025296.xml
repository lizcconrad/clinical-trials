    <textblock>
      Recently, we generated a new multidisciplinary ubiquitous healthcare system by upgrading our
      clinical decision supporting system (CDSS) rule engine, and integrating a physical
      activity-monitoring device and dietary feedback into a comprehensive package. We hypothesize
      that individualized multidisciplinary u-healthcare service combined with exercise monitoring
      and dietary feedback will result in better glucose control with less hypoglycemia in an
      elderly population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of telemedicine (also known as connected health, e-health, or telehealth) has been
      proven to be beneficial in chronic disease management. Now, the classic concept of
      telemedicine has been evolving to ubiquitous (u)-healthcare system with advanced information
      technologies which provides real-time individualized feedback using a monitoring device
      attached to the internet or a mobile phone system.

      A few studies showed that adopting a u-healthcare system helped patients improve their blood
      glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia or weight gain. In a previous study, supervised
      telemonitoring was effective for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in primary
      care settings. A recent study showed that telemonitoring with pharmacist's help achieved
      better blood pressure control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention.

      A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is the key to this system, building up an
      individualized CDSS rule engine is the crux of the u-healthcare system because current
      glucose control status, antidiabetic medications, lifestyle, and severity of hypoglycemia
      vary between individual patients.

      Recently, our u-healthcare team generated a new multidisciplinary u-healthcare system by
      upgrading the CDSS rule engine, and integrating a physical activity-monitoring device and
      dietary feedback into a comprehensive package. With this integrated system, we investigate
      the effect of individualized multidisciplinary u-healthcare service combined with exercise
      monitoring and dietary feedback on glucose control with less hypoglycemia in Korean elderly
      population.
