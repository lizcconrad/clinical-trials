    <textblock>
      PSMA ADC 2301EXT is an open-label study to further assess the anti-tumor activity as measured
      by radiographic imaging and biomarkers, safety and tolerability of Prostate Specific Membrane
      Antigen Antibody Drug Conjugate (PSMA ADC) in subjects with mCRPC. Subjects who have
      participated in the PSMA ADC 2301 study and who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
      are likely to benefit from continued treatment with PSMA ADC are eligible for the PSMA ADC
      2301 extension study. Subjects who are benefiting from treatment may be able to receive up to
      an additional eight to sixteen doses (every 3 weeks) of PSMA ADC.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Total Serum PSA Response</measure>
    <time_frame>25 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) was measured at baseline and had at least one post-baseline assessment. PSA response was examined at two levels: at least 30% decrease or at least 50% decrease in serum PSA. Response was assessed as the maximum decrease over the extension study. Response was defined as any decrease from baseline of at least 30% or 50%.</description>

    <measure>CTC Response</measure>
    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circulating tumor cells (CTC) response was measured at baseline and had at least one post-baseline assessment. Response was assessed as the maximum decrease over the extension study. Response was defined as any decrease from baseline of at least 50%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Radiologic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall radiologic response was measured at baseline and post-baseline. Imaging techniques used at screening were used throughout the study. The preferred imaging techniques include: bone scan, contrast enhanced CT of chest, contrast enhanced CT of pelvis, and contrast enhanced CT of upper &amp; lower abdomen. Best overall radiologic response (confirmed), target and non-target lesions, was defined as responses in bone, visceral or nodal metastases according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1). The best overall radiologic response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking, as reference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subject's best response assignment depended on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have completed the PSMA ADC 2301 study and who, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are likely to benefit from continued treatment with PSMA ADC

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          3. If chemically castrated, subjects must agree to stay on androgen-deprivation therapy
             for the duration of the study

          4. If applicable, men must agree to commit to the use of a medically acceptable method of
             birth control (e.g., spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom) or
             sexual abstinence for the duration of the study, including 30 days after the last dose
             of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. An acute infection requiring ongoing antibiotic therapy (e.g., UTI, indwelling
             catheter or other potential site(s) of infection)

          2. History of significant hypersensitivity reactions to PSMA ADC or any of its
             components, or to any prior investigational or approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
             immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion proteins (e.g., circulating neutralizing antibodies), or
             ADC

          3. Clinically significant cardiac disease or severe debilitating pulmonary disease

          4. Any recent or ongoing medical condition that may interfere with a subject's
             participation or compliance with the study or evaluation of PSMA ADC

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Total Serum PSA Response</title>
        <description>Total serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) was measured at baseline and had at least one post-baseline assessment. PSA response was examined at two levels: at least 30% decrease or at least 50% decrease in serum PSA. Response was assessed as the maximum decrease over the extension study. Response was defined as any decrease from baseline of at least 30% or 50%.</description>

        <population>Both groups must also have received and progressed on abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide prior to the study (once these agents were commercially available for use).

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Total Serum PSA Response</title>
          <description>Total serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) was measured at baseline and had at least one post-baseline assessment. PSA response was examined at two levels: at least 30% decrease or at least 50% decrease in serum PSA. Response was assessed as the maximum decrease over the extension study. Response was defined as any decrease from baseline of at least 30% or 50%.</description>
          <population>Both groups must also have received and progressed on abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide prior to the study (once these agents were commercially available for use).

        <title>Overall Radiologic Response</title>
        <description>Overall radiologic response was measured at baseline and post-baseline. Imaging techniques used at screening were used throughout the study. The preferred imaging techniques include: bone scan, contrast enhanced CT of chest, contrast enhanced CT of pelvis, and contrast enhanced CT of upper &amp; lower abdomen. Best overall radiologic response (confirmed), target and non-target lesions, was defined as responses in bone, visceral or nodal metastases according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1). The best overall radiologic response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking, as reference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subject's best response assignment depended on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
