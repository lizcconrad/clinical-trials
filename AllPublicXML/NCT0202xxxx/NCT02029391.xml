  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal dysfunction is considered as a major public health problem affecting about
      one third of the adult population. Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) characterized by myofacial
      trigger points as well as fascia tenderness are thought to be the main cause of
      musculoskeletal dysfunction. The aim of the treatment for musculoskeletal dysfunction is to
      reduce pain and restore normal function. Clinically, some evidence supports the application
      of kinesio tape in these patients. The underlying mechanism, however, is not clear. The
      investigators goal was to validate proposed mechanism of kinesio tape in these patients. The
      primary outcome are muscle stiffness, pain intensity and sensitivity.
