      1. Background

             -  Advanced guidewires with a U-shaped tip could effectively cross the long or
                multi-occlusive segment smoothly and go into the distal outflow vessel.

             -  The guidewire looping technique is a safe and effective method for the
                recanalization of the occluded lesions in infrapopliteal vessels.

        2. Objective - To compare the performance a loop-tipped guidewire with a straight-tipped
           guidewire in achieving successful deep biliary cannulation.

        3. Design

           - Prospective randomized trial.

        4. Setting:

           - Tertiary-care medical center

        5. Patients

           - This study will involve 192 patients with biliary diseases which require endoscopic
           retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

        6. Intervention - Cannulation of bile duct by using a loop-tipped guidewire or a
           straight-tipped guidewire

        7. Main outcome measurements - Compare the cannulation success rate, the duration of the
           cannulation, immediate and late complications.
