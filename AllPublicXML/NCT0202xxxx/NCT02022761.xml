    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      study, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of laninamivir octanoate administered by
      inhalation via the TwinCaps® DPI will be assessed in adults with mild or moderate chronic
      asthma.

    <textblock>
      32 subjects, as two sequential groups of 16 subjects at each dose level (40 mg and 80 mg),
      will be randomised 3:1 to receive active drug or matching placebo.

      Males and females aged 18 to 65 years inclusive, with mild or moderate chronic asthma.

      Stratum 1: Mild asthma - requiring treatment consistent with Global Initiative for Asthma
      (GINA) Step 2 Stratum 2: Moderate asthma - requiring treatment consistent with GINA Step 3

      Following a screening period of up to 30 days, eligible consenting subjects will be admitted
      to the clinic on the morning of Day 1. Laninamivir octanoate will be administered on Day 1.
      Subjects will remain in the clinic until Day 3 and will return for subsequent outpatient
      visits on Day 5, Day 6 and Day 7. A final follow-up visit for safety evaluations will occur
      on Day 14 ± 1 (or at the time of premature discontinuation). Each subject will participate in
      the study for approximately 7 weeks.
