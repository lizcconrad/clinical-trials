    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and pilot-test a short-term cognitive-behavioral
      treatment (CBT) for hospitalized survivors of acute burns, in order to reduce posttraumatic
      symptoms before they consolidate into long-term posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is
      important because approximately one third of burn survivors develop PTSD after discharge.
      PTSD is associated with extended psychological suffering and a greater need for medical
      services in the future. Although there are treatments for chronic PTSD, there are far fewer
      interventions available to treat acute posttraumatic symptoms before they develop into this
      disorder, and none to date has focused on adult burn survivors. The little research available
      on other forms of trauma suggests that interventions developed to treat PTSD may be helpful
      in preventing PTSD when used in the first weeks following a trauma.

      The investigators will develop a six-session intervention package for use with patients at
      the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Burn Center. The intervention will
      translate CBT principles that have been validated with trauma survivors, but will be adapted
      to hospitalized burn patients. After manual development, we will pilot-test this treatment on
      15 patients who are medically stable, and not critically ill, intubated, or delirious.
      Treatment will consist of three 50-minute CBT sessions per week, involving
      mindfulness-focused relaxation training, graduated exposure to memories of the burn,
      psychoeducation, and cognitive restructuring. Assessment will include standardized tests of
      posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression, administered at the initiation and termination
      of treatment, and at one-month follow-up. Also assessed will be number of hospital days to
      discharge and participant satisfaction with treatment. We will evaluate the overall
      feasibility of conducting a study on PTSD prevention in burn survivors, as measured by
      initial recruitment success, subsequent dropout rates at the end of treatment and at the
      one-month follow-up, and participant satisfaction. These data will then be used to support a
      subsequent application for funding of a larger-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) study.

    <description>Brief Treatment for Acutely Burned Patients (BTBP) adapts CBT principles that have been validated with non-burn trauma survivors to the treatment of hospitalized burn patients. BTBP consists of three 1 to 1Â½ hour sessions per week for two weeks, as well as two sessions for family members or partners/spouses.</description>
