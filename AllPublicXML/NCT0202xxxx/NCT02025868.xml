      Thilao is a multi-country, phase 2b, non-randomized study, in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire,
      Mali and Senegal, West Africa.

      HIV-1 adults with 2nd-line ART virologic failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;1000 copies/ml) will be
      recruited and followed in two phases:

        -  First, a 12-week intentive adherence reinforcement phase, during which patients will
           continue 2nd-line ART, be seen repeatidly for counseling and educational training on
           adherence, and be offered the possibility of phone, SMS and home visit contacts with
           social workers;

        -  Second, a 48-week phase, during which:

             -  Patients successfully resuppressed at the end of the first phase will continue
                2nd-line ART and adherence reinforcement;

             -  Patients with persitent virologic failure will switch to a darunavir/r +
                raltegravir-based 3rd-line ART.

      Genotype resistance tests will be performed retrospectively on frozen samples. The main
      outcome will be the percentage of patients with plasma HIV-1 viral RNA &lt;50 copies/ml at 64
      weeks.

      Main objective

      To estimate, in sub-Saharan African HIV-1 infected adults who failed a NNRTI-base first-line
      ART and then a PI-based second-line ART:

        1. The efficacy (and associated factors) at 12 weeks of an intensive 3-months adherence
           reinfrocement phase;

        2. In patients who successfully resuppress at 12 weeks: The percentage of patients still
           with continuing succesfull virologic supression on 2nd-line ART at 64 weeks (and factors
           associated to success) ;

        3. In patients with persistent failure at 12 weeks : The efficacy (and associated factors)
           at 64 weeks of a darunavir/r + raltegravir-based 3rd-line regimen.

      Number of participants : 200

      Main outcome :

        -  At 12 weeks : Proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml and/or with
           a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;2 log10 copies/ml between inclusion and 12 weeks;

        -  At 64 weeks : proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Age &gt;18 years

        -  Documented HIV-1 infection.

        -  History of failing a NNRTI-based 1st-line ART

        -  Current PI-based 2nd-line ART &gt;6 months

        -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;1000 copies/ml

        -  Signed informed consent
