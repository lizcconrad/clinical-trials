  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' goal in this planned prospective, randomized, patient blinded study is to
      compare our standard of care as the control group to an experimental group in which patients
      receive preemptive IV acetaminophen dosing that is continued every 6 hours for a total of 8
      doses in patients who have undergone major gynecologic surgery. The outcomes analyzed will
      include amount of rescue opioids required, time to return of bowel function, length of
      hospital stay, cost effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. The hypothesis is that the
      addition of IV acetaminophen will decrease the need for opioid rescue and thereby decrease
      the incidence of associated gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting,
      bloating, and constipation. The hope is that it will affect the final outcome of quicker
      return of bowel function, increased patient satisfaction, shortened hospital stay and prove
      to be an overall more cost effective postoperative pain management approach.

      This is a patient-blinded prospective study in which patients that undergo major gynecologic
      surgery via an open abdominal approach will be randomized into two arms:

        1. Control Group: Morphine patient-controlled-anesthesia (PCA) for the initial 24 hours
           post-operation with a low-dose basal rate (0.5mg/hr) and patient administered boluses
           prn. Oral oxycodone from 24-48 hours post-operation will be used prn for pain and then
           patients will be transitioned to oral combined oxycodone/acetaminophen for the remainder
           of their hospital stay. Normal saline 100cc IV will be infused as placebo every 6 hours
           for a total of eight doses with the first dose being given at time of anesthesia
           induction.

        2. Experimental Group: Morphine PCA for the initial 24 hours post-operation with low-dose
           basal rate (0.5mg/hr) with patient administered boluses prn. IV acetaminophen 1,000mg
           will be given every six hours for a total of eight doses with the first dose being given
           at time of anesthesia induction. Oral oxycodone from 24-48 hours post-operation will be
           used prn and then patients will be transitioned to oral combined oxycodone/acetaminophen
           for the remainder of their hospital stay.

      Outcomes that will be analyzed include the amount of opioids used; time to return of bowel
      function designated as passage of flatus; time to first bowel movement if it occurs while
      inpatient; duration of hospital stay; cost effectiveness; and patient symptoms and
      satisfaction at the 24 and 48 hour marks as well as at time of discharge.

    <description>Subjects will rate their overall satisfaction with study treatment and treatment associated adverse side effects (TAAEs) (e.g. nausea, vomiting, bloating, constipation) at 24 hours, 48 hours, and again at time of discharge using a categorical scale: 1 poor; 2 fair; 3 good; 4 excellent.</description>

Cost analysis will be limited to price of pain medications as well as those used to treat TAAEs (e.g. ondansetron, promethazine, simethicone, bisacodyl); diagnostic or laboratory studies used to evaluate potential TAAEs (e.g. abdominal radiograph to evaluate for possible ileus, comprehensive metabolic panel); and base daily hospitalization cost</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Female patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery via an open abdominal approach. The
        included surgeries would be exploratory laparotomy with or without removal of uterus,
        fallopian tubes, or ovaries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with baseline preoperative liver function enzymes (AST and ALT) that are
             greater than twice the upper limit of normal would be excluded.

          -  Patients with baseline CrCl &lt;30.

          -  Patients that require intensive postoperative care and delayed extubation will
             typically require additional sedation which would impede adequate evaluation of the
             two study pain regimens as they are designed to be patient controlled.

          -  Patients with complications unrelated to the pain regimens that prolong their stay
             would be excluded from the evaluation of hospital stay and cost effectiveness
             analyses. Examples would include but are not limited to pre-renal azotemia and acute
             renal failure; pneumonia; venous thromboembolism; or need for re-exploration
             laparotomy.

          -  Allergy to acetaminophen would exclude those patients set to enter the experimental IV
             acetaminophen study arm. One exception would be if the allergy were trivial and
             related to route of administration such as mild nausea with oral acetaminophen.

          -  Patients that undergo a bowel resection during surgery as it may adversely effect
             return of bowel function

          -  Patients that have required regular opioid intake for the 7 days preceding surgery.

          -  NSAIDs within 8 hours of surgery.

          -  Chronic steroid use with the exception of low-dose inhaled steroid formulations.

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Patients currently pregnant.

          -  Patients unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Age &gt;85

          -  Any physical, medical, and mental condition that would make participation in the study
             inadvisable.
