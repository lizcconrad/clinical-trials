    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to determine whether an intervention that provides
      information to primary care providers about gaps in care for their patients recently
      discharged from hospital for COPD can reduce hospital re-admissions and mortality and improve
      their patients' quality-of-life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are common among Veterans admitted
      to hospital, lead to worsening health-related quality of life, and are important drivers of
      health care expenditures. As many as half of patients discharged for COPD are readmitted
      within 6 months. An intervention to improve COPD care is needed, not only to treat patients
      for COPD and their accompanying comorbidities, but also to redesign the care delivery system.
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test an intervention to improve patient care during the
      transition from hospital to outpatient setting for patients discharged for COPD. The
      investigators are targeting the intervention to Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) providers
      who are randomized to receive the intervention or not receive the intervention. For the
      intervention, study clinicians, consisting of experienced primary care providers and
      pulmonary specialists, reviewed the medical record for each patient discharged from hospital
      for COPD. The team looked for gaps in care for COPD and key co-morbidities such as obesity,
      hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. They focused on immediate care processes
      associated with the hospital admission and comorbid disease treatment. For providers in the
      intervention group, the team placed any patient care recommendations into the medical record
      using a non-visit consult note and pre-filled order sets. The patient's provider then
      accepted, modified, or declined any or all of the recommendations based on personal knowledge
      of the patient's history. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will: 1)
      improve patient quality of life; and 2) decrease hospital readmission and mortality after
      hospital admission for COPD exacerbation.
