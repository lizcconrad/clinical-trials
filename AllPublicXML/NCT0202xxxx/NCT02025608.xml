      The purpose of this study is to explore whether patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS)
      differ from healthy subjects in daytime and night time autonomic function and cardiovascular
      risk markers and whether 4 week treatment with pramipexole affects autonomic function and
      cardiovascular risk markers in patients with RLS.
