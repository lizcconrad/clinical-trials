    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the use of Synvisc-One will improve physical therapy compliance
      and performance, resulting in improved knee function and pain when compared to a group that
      receives a sham injection (an injection that does not have medicine) only before a
      standardized physical therapy regimen over 10 weeks.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject and physical therapist), sham needle
      injection controlled, single center, multi-site study.

      Subjects with primary osteoarthritis knee pain will be randomly assigned to a 6 ml
      intra-articular injection of Synvisc-One or sham needle injection.

      The post-treatment course of physical therapy will begin between Day 3 and Day 14 and will
      last up to 12 weeks in duration (PT ends at study Week 12). Subjects are encouraged to
      complete between 6 and 16 physical therapy visits within 10-12 weeks of physical therapy
      treatment as determined by the treating Physical Therapist.

    <measure>Difference in Pain Score Between Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is the inter-group difference in the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) pain subscale score over 12 and 24 weeks in subjects diagnosed with primary knee OA that are treated with standardized PT and Synvisc-One versus those that are treated with standardized PT and a sham injection.
The scale range is 0-100 with a higher score being better. The pain scale is a subscale of the overall KOOS, and there are no smaller subscales described or used to create this score.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized into this group will receive, under sterile conditions, a sham injection of lidocaine 1% (10 mg/ml) 1-2 ml. Sterile preparation of the affected knee (treatment site) and the sham injection procedure will take place after sterile preparation into subcutaneous tissue without involving treatment to the intra-articular joint. The sham procedure will be performed by the unblinded treating physician ONLY. This procedure will include an 22-25 gauge needle stick through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue without violating the joint capsule or performing arthrocentesis.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized into the Synvisc-One group will receive a single 6 mL intra-articular injection of Synvisc-One under sterile conditions. The unblinded treating physician will prepare the treatment site according to his/her standard practice guidelines (i.e. after cutaneous numbing with a vasocoolant spray and / or local lidocaine injection), an 18 gauge needle will be advanced into one of three compartments of the knee using the injectors' technique of choice. Subjects will be monitored for a minimum 5 minutes post injection to evaluate for adverse events.</description>

        <title>Difference in Pain Score Between Groups</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is the inter-group difference in the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) pain subscale score over 12 and 24 weeks in subjects diagnosed with primary knee OA that are treated with standardized PT and Synvisc-One versus those that are treated with standardized PT and a sham injection.
The scale range is 0-100 with a higher score being better. The pain scale is a subscale of the overall KOOS, and there are no smaller subscales described or used to create this score.</description>

            <title>Sham Injection</title>
            <description>Subjects randomized into this group will receive, under sterile conditions, a sham injection of lidocaine 1% (10 mg/ml) 1-2 ml. Sterile preparation of the affected knee (treatment site) and the sham injection procedure will take place after sterile preparation into subcutaneous tissue without involving treatment to the intra-articular joint. The sham procedure will be performed by the unblinded treating physician ONLY. This procedure will include an 22-25 gauge needle stick through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue without violating the joint capsule or performing arthrocentesis.</description>

            <description>Subjects randomized into the Synvisc-One group will receive a single 6 mL intra-articular injection of Synvisc-One under sterile conditions. The unblinded treating physician will prepare the treatment site according to his/her standard practice guidelines (i.e. after cutaneous numbing with a vasocoolant spray and / or local lidocaine injection), an 18 gauge needle will be advanced into one of three compartments of the knee using the injectors' technique of choice. Subjects will be monitored for a minimum 5 minutes post injection to evaluate for adverse events.
