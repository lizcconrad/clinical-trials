  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors
      on central nervous system (CNS) reward and satiety circuits in the etiology of obesity. The
      investigators will also investigate to what extent the alterations in CNS reward and satiety
      circuits are a cause or a consequence of the development of obesity.
