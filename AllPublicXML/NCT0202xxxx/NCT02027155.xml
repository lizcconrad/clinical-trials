  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, rising-dose study of single IV
      doses of AR09 in healthy subjects. Each infusion will occur over 10 minutes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will complete Screening, Baseline, Treatment, and Follow-Up Phases. The
      Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis within 30 days, but no less than 3
      days, prior to the start of the Baseline Phase. The Baseline Phase will consist of clinical
      research unit (CRU) admission and final qualification assessments. The Treatment Phase will
      be comprised of dosing on Day 1, post-treatment safety and pharmacodynamic assessments, and
      blood and urine collection. Subjects may be discharged approximately 24 hours after study
      drug administration on Day 2, provided the Modified Aldrete Score and all designated
      discharge criteria are clinically acceptable to the Investigator. The Follow-Up Phase will
      occur on Study Day 5 (± 1 day).

For ADX892, individual and group estimates of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, terminal phase rate constant (λz), and t1/2. Additional PK parameters for the metabolite, such as metabolite to parent ratios will be calculated on the basis of the available data.
Compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis may be employed depending upon the appearance of the AR09 and ADX892 plasma concentration-time profiles.</description>
