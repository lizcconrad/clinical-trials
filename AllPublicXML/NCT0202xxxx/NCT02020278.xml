  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to provide 6 months of safety follow-up for children and
      adolescents with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who have previously
      participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial, and to assess the efficacy of tolvaptan in
      increasing serum sodium for those subjects who receive optional continuing tolvaptan
      treatment of variable duration (up to 6 months).

      Core Safety Follow-up Component • For all subjects: To evaluate the post-treatment safety
      follow-up of children and adolescent subjects with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic)
      hyponatremia who have previously participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial.

      Optional Tolvaptan Treatment Component

      • For subjects who receive optional tolvaptan treatment: To demonstrate that tolvaptan safely
      and effectively achieves and maintains increased serum sodium concentrations in children and
      adolescent subjects with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia when used for
      both multiple short-term treatments, and/or longer chronic treatments.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Issues with recruitment &amp; enrolment which made the trial impossible or highly impracticable.
    The termination of this trial is not due to safety reasons.

             (STAT) serum sodium assessment &lt; 130 mEq/L (mmol/L), which will serve as the baseline
             value for efficacy endpoints, is to be obtained within 2 to 4 hours prior to the first
