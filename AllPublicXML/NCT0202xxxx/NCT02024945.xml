  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study were to assess Quality of Life (QoL) and urination urge,
      incontinence, and micturition frequency including nocturia after 4 and 12 weeks treatment
      with propiverine.

      The drug being tested in this study is called propiverine. Propiverine is being tested to
      evaluate Quality of Life (QoL) and improvement of OAB symptoms in people who take
      propiverine. The study will enroll approximately 1000 patients who the treating physician
      decided to treat with propiverine 15mg tablets or 30 mg regulated release capsules as part of
      their normal clinical practice. All participants will be asked to keep a voiding diary for 2
      consecutive days and to complete a QoL questionnaire after 1st visit and before each
      subsequent visit. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Belgium. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 12 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to their
      healthcare provider.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quality of Life (QoL) as assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) at Weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The King's Health Questionnaire is a condition-specific health-related QoL instrument for the assessment of patients with lower urinary tract conditions including overactive bladder. It is a self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep or energy, and severity of urinary symptoms). All domains were assessed in a range: 0-100, where 0=best and 100=worst outcome. Lower scores indicates better QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Urination Urge at Weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant kept a voiding diary and recorded urinary urgency. The diary was kept for 2 consecutive days within 7 days of the Baseline visit, and 2 consecutive days just before the Week 4 and 12 visits. The average urination urge was then calculated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Incontinence episodes at Weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient kept a voiding diary and episodes of incontinence. The diary was kept for 2 consecutive days within 7 days of the Baseline visit, and 2 consecutive days just before the Week 4 and 12 visits. The average number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Micturition Frequency including nocturia at Weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient kept a voiding diary and recorded the number of micturitions. The diary was kept for 2 consecutive days within 7 days of the Baseline visit, and 2 consecutive days just before the Week 4 and 12 visits. The average number of micturitions and nocturia episodes per 24 hours was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Urine Volume per Void at Weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean volume per void (or amount of urine per urination) over 24 hours is based on a 2-day diary maintained by the participant.</description>
