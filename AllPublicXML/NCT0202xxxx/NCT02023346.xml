  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the understanding patients with brain tumors
      have of their disease and their communication with their physician. Ultimately, we hope to
      use these findings to improve communication between patients and their doctors.

    <description>This is a cross-sectional study of patients with MG who are admitted to the inpatient Neurology service at MSKCC. We anticipate that participants will be accrued over approximately 18-24 months. All patients with MG admitted to Neurology, will be screened for eligibility and willingness to participate in the study.</description>

        Participants will be recruited from the inpatient Neurology service. Caregivers will be
        recruited from either the inpatient Neurology service (if they are physically present at
        the hospital at the time of the patient's consent to participate) or via telephone
        communication (if not physically present at the time of patient consent).
