      The TAILORED-Treatment consortium was established to develop new tools aimed to increase the
      effectiveness of antibiotic and antifungal therapy, reduce adverse events, and help limit the
      emergence of antimicrobial resistance in children and adults.

      In reality, targeted antimicrobial therapy can most effectively be achieved by utilizing
      personalized data to facilitate a tailored and optimized approach to individual patient
      treatment. This can best be achieved by utilizing knowledge gained from both host-centered
      and pathogen-centered parameters during health and disease. Unfortunately, these parameters
      have traditionally, tended to be measured independently (for example using microbial culture
      or PCR-based methods for microbial detection, or measurement of the immune response to
      infections and/or blood-based biomarkers in the host), and used on an ad hoc basis without
      careful integration for the best treatment of the patient. However, recent advances in the
      development of high-throughput and sensitive molecular-based technologies, on-line internet
      database access tools, and bioinformatics analysis, now means that the goal of personalized
      medicine and treatment is in sight. Unfortunately however, there currently exists a
      technological gap between recent state-of-the-art methodologies (for example with respect to
      gaining new insights into novel host-pathogen interactions) and laboratory-to-bedside results
      to benefit patients, physicians and society as a whole. The TAILORED-Treatment project is
      designed to bridge this technological gap in order to generate novel insights and innovations
      that are readily exploitable for the maximum benefit of multiple stakeholders in the field of
      personalized medicine and infectious diseases.

        Eligible subjects aged one month of age and older from both genders that attend the
        hospital or the ED due to a suspected respiratory infections and/or sepsis (onset of
        symptoms ≤8 days prior to recruitment) or due to a non-infectious disease. These subjects
        are expected to fall into one of the following categories:

          1. Patients with an acute bacterial infection

          2. Patients with an acute viral infection

          3. Patients with an acute mixed co-infection (bacterial and viral)

          4. Patients with a fungal infection

          5. Patients with an undetermined disease etiology

          6. Patients with a non-infectious disease (control group) Patients from subgroups 1-6
             will also be classified based on the presence or absence of sepsis or severe sepsis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        : Patients who are at least one month old will be eligible for inclusion.

        The LRTI disease group should also fulfill the following criteria:

        Presence of two or more of the following signs of respiratory distress:

        Tachypnea, Chest cough, Nasal flaring, Retractions, Rales, Expiratory wheeze and/or
        decreased breath sounds

        The Sepsis group should also fulfill the following criteria:

        Sepsis will be defined as a combination of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
        due to infectious agent. SIRS will be determined according to published criteria (the
        International Sepsis Definitions Conference, 2001) based on (in adults):

        Heart rate (higher than 90/min) Respiratory rate (higher than 20/min or PaCO2 lower than 32
        mmHg) Core body temperature (higher than 38°C or lower than 36°C) White blood cell count
        (higher than 12,000 cells/ µl or lower than 4,000/ µl)

        SIRS is defined as at least two of the above criteria, one of which must be abnormal
        temperature or white blood cell count

        Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus one of the following:

        Cardiovascular failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome Two or more other organ failure
        As normal physiological variables are different for children, the SIRS criteria are defined
        separately for children under 18. SIRS and severe sepsis criteria per age group are defined
        in details in the &quot;Population/Inclusion criteria&quot; section below, according to guidelines of
        the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (2005).

        The non-infectious disease group will include:

        Patients with a non-infectious disease. Children in this group can only be included when
        blood sampling for this study can be combined with blood sampling as part of standard of
        care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An episode of febrile infection during the past 3 weeks

          -  A proven or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV),
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection

          -  Presence of obvious alternative causes of respiratory distress, such as heart failure
             or pneumothorax

          -  Patients with a nosocomial LRTI (developed &gt; 3days after hospitalization)

          -  Post-transplant patients

          -  Congenital immune deficiency (CID)

          -  Active hematological malignancy

          -  Current treatment with immune-suppressive or immune-modulating therapies including:

          -  Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy or High dose steroids &gt;1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent
             in the past two weeks, Monoclonal antibody or Intravenous IgG (IVIG), Cyclosporine,
             Anti-TNF agents, Interferon (of all kinds)

          -  Other severe illnesses that affect life expectancy and quality of life such as:
             Moderate to severe psychomotor retardation Moderate to severe congenital metabolic
             disorder

        In children only: Other severe illnesses affecting life expectancy less than one year.
