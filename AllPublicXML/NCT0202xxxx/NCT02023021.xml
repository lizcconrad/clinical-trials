  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than
      5%. About 25% of patients have the opportunity for radically surgical resection when
      diagnosis. However, the recurrence rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical
      trials indicated that gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy reduced recurrence and enhanced
      overall survival for patients who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor.
      Nab-paclitaxel could enhance the intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine; recent studies
      showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved progression-free survival
      and overall survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The present study is intended
      to investigate the activity and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      as adjuvant chemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer after curative
      resection.
