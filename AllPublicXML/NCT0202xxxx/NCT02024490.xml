  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, also called as hyaline membrane disease,
      is the most common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants, correlating with
      structural and functional lung immaturity. The pathophysiology of RDS is complex. Immature
      type II alveolar cells produce less surfactant that causes an increase in alveolar surface
      tension and a decrease in compliance. This resultant atelectasis lead to pulmonary vascular
      constriction, hypoperfusion, and lung tissue ischemia. RDS and prolonged ventilation and
      associated systemic/lung injury may also contribute to long term oxygen dependency and may
      result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone that
      primarily contributes to the maintenance of normal calcium homeostasis and skeletal
      mineralization. In addition to its classical role in bone metabolism, vitamin D deficiency
      has been associated with impaired pulmonary function, increased incidence of viral and
      bacterial infections and inflammatory lung diseases. Although exact mechanisms are not fully
      understood, vitamin D appears to impact on a variety of inflammatory and structural cells
      within the lung including macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells. To our best of
      knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of vitamin D levels on the severity and presence
      of RDS in preterm infants. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the possible role
      of maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels on RDS development in preterm infants. We also aim to
      determine the possible association between maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels and the
      incidence of BPD and other neonatal morbidities.

      Preterm infants with respiratory distress who are &lt;37 weeks of gestational age and will be
      admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research
      Hospital will be included in this prospective study. Blood for neonatal and maternal vitamin
      D levels will be obtained from all infants and their mothers at the time of hospital
      admission. The infants will be evaluated for RDS and surfactant requirement. If they have RDS
      and need of mechanical ventilation, they will be intubated and given surfactant, if
      necessary. The maternal and neonatal demographics of infants will be recorded. Infants will
      also be followed up in terms of other morbidities including patent ductus arteriosus,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and especially BPD. Then infants will
      be divided into three groups according to maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels (mild, moderate
      and severe vitamin D deficiency) and group comparisons will be performed Plasmas after
      separated and stored at -80 C. Levels of 25-OHD will be determined using Shimadzu LC-20AT
      model High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Data will be analyzed using SPSS
      software and appropriate statistical analyses will be performed.
