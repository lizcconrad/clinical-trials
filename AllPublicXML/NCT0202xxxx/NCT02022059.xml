    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition is the treatment of choice for malnourish patient. Nasogastric tube (NGT)
      is although a common act. Unfortunately, this procedure can be painful. Also, many patients
      will need many NGT re-insertion. Therefore, the investigators need to increase the
      acceptability of this procedure by increasing comfort during NGT passage. Professionals
      guidelines of HAS (recommendations professionnelles de bonne pratiques de soins) and SFNEP
      (Société Française de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme) talk about the possibility of using
      local anesthesic without ordering their use. However, NGT tube insertion is often put without
      pre-medication in the face of an accumulating body of evidence indicating that local
      anesthetic prior NGT insertion decrease discomfort of the procedure. On the other hand, these
      studies have been done in the emergency room with NGT of a bigger gauge and for many reasons
      except enteral nutrition.

      The investigators primary objective of this prospective monocentric study is to evaluate the
      efficacy (patient comfort) of lidocaine 5 % spray versus placebo (physiologic serum) before
      NGT insertion in patient needing enteral nutrition, using visual analogue scale. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate nurse and patient satisfaction using questionnaires, facility of
      NGT insertion using Likert scale, numbers of try, time of procedure, complications like
      tracheal insertion and success of the insertion using thorax x-ray.

      The study will be held in CHU Nice at nutrition unit support. After signed consentment,
      patients will be separate in two groups : group A (lidocaïne spray 5 %) and group B
      (physiologic serum). There will be 2 spray in nostril and 2 in orophagyngeal cavity 2 minutes
      before NGT insertion, which will be done by a competent nurse. Vital signs will be noted at
      the beginning of the procedure and 10 minutes after. At the end, the nurse and the patient
      will have to answer a questionnaire. Pain will be grade using visual analogue scale
      immediately after the procedure. Demographic data and complications will be note by the
      investigator. Finally, thorax X-ray will be done at the end of the procedure. There will be
      34 patients by group. If the investigators find a benefit, this can change their practice and
      guidelines.
