  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how changes in levels of obesity-related
      hormones in the gastrointestinal tract following Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding
      (LAGB) surgery may lead to a decrease in appetite and weight loss. Learning exactly how the
      Lap Band works may help us to develop new, less invasive treatments for morbid obesity. This
      knowledge may also lead to the development of preventive, cost-effective treatment
      strategies. As a control subject, participants will provide a comparison for changes in these
      hormones with medical weight loss compared to weight loss after LAGB surgery.

      The expected duration of participation in the study is up to 6 months before bariatric
      surgery depending on participants' weight loss and insurance company requirements. A total of
      10 patients will take part in this control group.

      The following procedures and tests will be done before surgery: routine standard tests
      required to be involved in the obesity surgery program (history and physical, blood work,
      ECG, nutritional assessment, psychological assessment and sleep study). During preoperative
      evaluation participants will be started on a medical weight loss diet with instructions
      provided by the program's endocrinologist, nurse practitioners and dietitians with the weight
      loss goals as stipulated by insurance companies and have a series of additional laboratory
      tests (blood work) done to test the hormonal response to weight loss.

      This blood work, which is drawn after eating a standardized meal, is the only experimental
      procedure of the entire study. We will be measuring several hormones associated with obesity
      including ghrelin, obestatin, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY3-36), adiponectin, Glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin, leptin, insulin, glucose and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).
      Measurements will be done at 4 time intervals before surgery: at enrollment, +1-month,
      +3-months, and +6-months. This will allow us to look at hormone levels as participants
      gradually lose weight. If a participant reaches the insurance-dictated weight loss before 6
      months, study participation will cease to allow the individual to proceed with surgery
      scheduling.

      Participants will be required to fast overnight prior to each visit. An intravenous line will
      be placed at 0800, all subjects will be fed a standard breakfast (35% fat, 15% protein, and
      50% carbohydrate) consisting of 25% of estimated caloric needs for weight maintenance, which
      they will consume in 30 minutes or less. Blood will be taken beginning 30 minutes before the
      standardized meal, then at time 0, then 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the meal for total
      ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, PYY3-36, active GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, leptin,
      oxyntomodulin, and glucose. An extra fasting sample will be obtained for lipids and total
      adiponectin. Three-quarters of a cup (148 mL) of blood will be drawn for analysis at each
      visit. Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) three
      times during each research visit by placing a single vertical mark across a 100 mm in length
      line, with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative
      rating, to assess hunger, satiety, and fullness. Each visit will last approximately 4 hours.

    <time_frame>Preoperatively (baseline) and at 1-, 3- and 6-months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome measures the mechanism of action of the adjustable band in producing weight loss from the time of surgery to visit timepoints at plus one, 3 and six months following LAGB placement. Changes in appetite and hunger will be measured in the form of a validated clinical analogue scale from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Statistical analysis will be performed to look for changes in blood levels of gut hormones (total ghrelin, PYY3-36, total adiponectin, active GLP-1, glucose, glucagon, insulin, leptin, oxyntomodulin, and pancreatic polypeptide) measured before and after a standardized meal from baseline values to 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery.</description>

      Each time these hormone assays are performed, aliquots of plasma will be frozen at -80C:

        -  Total immunoreactive ghrelin - Plasma will be assayed in duplicate for immunoreactive
           ghrelin concentration using a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA)

        -  Lipids - Plasma total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C will be measured

        -  Glucose and insulin - Plasma glucose concentrations will be measured in triplicate using
           the glucose oxidase method. Plasma insulin will be measured in duplicate using a
           modification of a double antibody radioimmunoassay

        -  Adiponectin and other gut hormones - Adiponectin, PYY3,36 and GLP-1 will be measured
           using a commercial RIA. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) will be measured using a commercial
           RIA

        Patients with morbid obesity or severe obesity with comorbidities who meet the National
