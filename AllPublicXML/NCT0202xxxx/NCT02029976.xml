    <textblock>
      Primary Aim: To test the efficacy of an elementary school-based, school nurse-led weight
      management program to reduce excess weight gain among children, 8 to 12 years old who are
      overweight and at risk of overweight by increasing healthy dietary practices and physical
      activity levels and decreasing sedentary practices.

      Primary Hypothesis: Relative to the control condition, the children receiving the
      intervention will have a significantly lower body mass index (BMI), following implementation
      of the 9-month intervention, controlling for baseline values.

    <description>Body Mass Index (primary outcome) is the recommended method of assessing overweight among adults and children and will be calculated with the formula: weight (kg)/height (m) 2. To determine child BMI percentile, we will calculate age- and gender-adjusted BMI with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts (ANTHRO 1.01 software-CDC). The primary outcome measure will be change in BMI z-score.</description>

    <description>The 9-month after school weight management program called SNAPSHOT (Student, Nurses and Parents Seeking Healthy Options Together), with a focus on healthy food and activity practices will be directed by a school nurse and will include: 1) quarterly parent/child coaching sessions with the school nurse held in the participant's home; 2) 14 child group sessions led by the school nurse, held in a school setting 1-2 times a month; 3) 5 parent group sessions led by a school nurse held in a school setting; and 4) collaboration with health care providers and community-based organizations that provide families opportunities for healthy eating and activity. Mailed monthly newsletters</description>
