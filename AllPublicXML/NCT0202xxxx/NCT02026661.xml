  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the association of factors affecting the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates
      in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) who received intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (ICSI) and/or laser assisted hatching (LAH) or neither.

      After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 400 women who underwent IVF
      between January 2007 and December 2010 were included in the analysis. Patients were divided
      into 4 groups; 1) those that did not receive ICSI or LAH, 2) those that received ICSI only,
      3) those that received LAH only, and 4) those that received both ICSI and LAH. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were performed.
