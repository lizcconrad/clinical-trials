  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled crossover study, the investigators propose to test the
      hypothesis that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase plasma levels of asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is a marker of endothelial dysfunction. The authors propose to
      evaluate ADMA concentrations and vascular function analysis in healthy volunteers and adults
      with a history of cardiovascular disease given PPI vs placebo for four weeks each.
