  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary aim of this study is to test the impact of a strategy of perioperative
      chloride-restriction through intravenous (IV) fluid therapy on the incidence of acute kidney
      injury after cardiac surgery.

      A prospective, open-label, single-centre 4-period sequential study of varying strategies of
      perioperative IV fluid composition will test the hypothesis that a perioperative protocol for
      the administration of chloride-poor intravenous fluids compared to chloride-rich intravenous
      fluids will reduce the incidence of AKI after adult cardiothoracic surgery.

    <textblock>
      After an initial run-in period of approximately 1 month (using a chloride-rich fluid
      strategy), the first study period of 5 months will commence, also comprising a chloride-rich
      perioperative IV fluid therapy strategy (0.9% saline or 4% albumin). This will include
      intraoperative fluid and postoperative fluid for the duration of stay in the intensive care
      unit. This will then be followed by a 1-month transition period before a second period of 5
      months will commence where perioperative intravenous fluid therapy will consist of
      chloride-poor fluids (Lactated Ringer's solution or concentrated 20% albumin). A subsequent
      1-month transition period will then be followed by a third period of 5 months characterized
      by perioperative IV fluid therapy with an alternative combination of chloride-poor solutions
      (PlasmaLyteÂ® 148 or concentrated 20% albumin). A final 1-month transition period will be
      followed by a fourth and final period of 5 months characterized by a return to perioperative
      IV fluid therapy with chloride-rich fluids (0.9% saline or 4% albumin). A final 1-month
      run-off period using a chloride-rich perioperative fluid strategy will follow prior to study
      completion.
