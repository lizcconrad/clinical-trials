      This extension study will only enroll individuals who have completed one year of treatment in
      the parent protocol &quot;Effect of Teriparatide, Vibration and the Combination on Bone Mass and
      Bone Architecture in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury (NCT01225055)&quot;. This study will allow those
      individuals who received Teriparatide (20ug/day) and vibration (10 min/day) during the parent
      study to be treated for a second year and will allow those individuals who received
      teriparatide-placebo to have the opportunity to have a full year of teriparatide therapy.
      This study will determine if two years of exposure to teriparatide will result in a greater
      increase in Bone Mass Density (BMD) than that seen after a single year's treatment. Subjects
      will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months after initiating treatment with measurement of bone
      density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment in, and completion of one year of treatment, in protocol &quot;Effect of
             Teriparatide, Vibration and the Combination on Bone Mass and Bone Architecture in
             Chronic Spinal Cord Injury&quot;.

          -  Adherence rate for teriparatide use of â‰¥60%.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who could not tolerate teriparatide treatment.

          -  Individuals who will not be able to return for all study visits.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Other medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the
             subject from completing the study
