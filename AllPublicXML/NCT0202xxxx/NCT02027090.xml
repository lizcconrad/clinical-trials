  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that higher dose icotinib is related with better efficacy. The primary
      objective is to compare the progression-free survival of higher dose and routine dose of
      icotinib in treating pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with stable
      disease after 8-week routine dose icotinib treatment.
