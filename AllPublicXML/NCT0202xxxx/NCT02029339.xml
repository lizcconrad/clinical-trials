  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The closed systems, such as conventional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), were usually
      avoided in infected or critical colonized wounds. To our observation, the additional
      continuous irrigation tube attached beside the suction tube in the NPWT system could provide
      the effective drainage by reducing the occlusion of suction tube, enable effective
      debridement by diluting infected/necrotized tissues and decrease the incidence of fistula by
      providing relatively moist ambient. At our institutions, the modified system combined with a
      &quot;triple-tube&quot; device to allow a continuous instillation became more active and efficient. The
      study is to investigate if a continuous triple-tube instillation and suction could improve
      the outcomes of acute severely infected open abdomen.

    <textblock>
      This study was performed on the patients with a severely complicated infected open abdomen
      treated with topical triple-tube irrigation and suction, compared with a control group of the
      patients treated with standard NPWT without topical irrigation. The clinical outcomes were
      recorded. Profiles of cytokines/proteinase in wound fluid were quantified weekly.

    <description>Wound fluid was collected at the initial admission and every three days later. Before samples were collected, irrigation was released and held for 6 hours to avoid contamination or dilution by the washed solution. Wound fluid was collected using a filter paper (PerioPaper, Oraflow Inc., NY) for 30 seconds as prior described and stored at −80°C until analyses.</description>

    <description>The triple-tube device was continuous operated: instilled the topical solution through the &quot;washing tube&quot;, delivered negative pressure therapy at 100 - 125 mmHg continuously through the inner tube of &quot;sleeve tubes&quot; through the central negative pressure device in the wall of the ward. The outer tube was used for normalize and balance the distribution of the negative pressure around the inner tube to allow the solution to penetrate through the dressing to cover the wound, and protecting the inner tube from getting stuck with the sucked tissue. All tubes are all commercially available (Medical Silicone Tubing, Forbest Manufacturing Co., Ltd, China).</description>
