  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 50% of young children undergoing surgery exhibit high level of anxiety during
      induction of anesthesia because of exposure to unfamiliar environment and people and
      separation from parents. Increased preoperative anxiety may impact postoperative behavior
      changes such as emergence agitation, separation anxiety and sleep disturbance. Although some
      pediatric anesthesiologists routinely permit parental presence to reduce the anxiety during
      induction of anesthesia, previous studies have reported conflicting results. Recently the
      distraction using video game or animated cartoon has been reported to reduce anxiety of young
      children during induction of anesthesia. However, it was still undetermined whether
      distraction has its own ability to reduce children's anxiety separated from parental presence
      because they evaluated the effect of video method in the parental presence. The investigators
      design to investigated the efficacy of distraction with watching cartoon, parental presence
      and combined with watching cartoon and parental presence on reduction of anxiety during
      inhalational induction of anesthesia using sevoflurane. In addition this study includes
      long-term effect of each intervention such as postoperative emergence agitation and
      postoperative behavior change in children.

      This study is different from previous reports as follow. First, investigators separate the
      effect of cartoon distraction and parental presence on minimizing preoperative anxiety and
      determine whether an interaction between two different interventions is existent. Second,
      investigators evaluate the effect of preoperative anxiety on the long-term behavioral change
      of children. It was not clarified yet in clinical practice. Third, investigators evaluate the
      effect of each intervention on parental anxiety before and after induction of anesthesia.

    <measure>Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Scores at Baseline, Arrival in Operating Room, and Inhalation Induction</measure>
    <time_frame>1. baseline (10 minute after arrival in the preoperative holding area) 2. on arrival in the operating room, 3. during inhalational induction with sevoflurane</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measure change in anxiety of children using Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale (m-YPAS): Scale changes from Activities, Vocalization, Expressing emotions, State of arousal, Interaction with family members.
Each domain received a partial score based on the punctuation observed divided by the number of categories of that domain. The score of each domain is added to the others
Total scores ranged from 23.4 to 100 The scores considered &quot;cut points&quot; to determine whether a patient had/had not anxiety were 23
Without anxiety: 23.4 e 30
With anxiety: greater than 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Parental Anxiety at Postinduction of Anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>1. baseline: 15 minute after arrival at preoperative holding area before induction of anesthesia 2. postinduction : after induction of anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measure change of parental anxiety using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological inventory and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis.
The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic.
Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.
Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored.
Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Emergence Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>at 20 minute in postanesthetic care unit</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measure postoperative emergence delirium of children after recovery of anesthesia using Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain(CHEOP) Scale at 20 minute in postanesthetic care unit
The CHEOPS (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale) is a behavioral scale for evaluating postoperative pain in young children. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions for reducing the pain and discomfort.
CHEOPS pain score = SUM(points for all 6 parameters) : Cry, facila, Child verbal, Torso, Touch, legs
Interpretation:
minimum score: 4 = no pain
maximum score: 13 = the worst pain
When the highest CHEOPS score recorded at any time exceeded 10, emergence delirium was deemed to be present.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Behavioral Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>1. postoperative 2 days, 2 postoperative 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measure negative postoperative behavioral change of children after discharge of postanesthetic care unit using posthospital behavioral questionnaires( PHBQ ) at postoperative day (POD) 1 by visiting and followed at POD 14 by phone interview.
The PHBQ consists of 27 items concerning sleep, eating, anxiety, aggressive behaviour, etc.
The subscales were: general anxiety and regression, separation anxiety, anxiety about sleep, eating disturbance, aggression towards authority, and withdrawal.
Negative behavior change was evaluated in 6 subscales categories. If more than one negative behavior change developed, the investigators calculated number of children who developed new-onset negative behavior change.</description>

        <description>The investigators measure change in anxiety of children using Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale (m-YPAS): Scale changes from Activities, Vocalization, Expressing emotions, State of arousal, Interaction with family members.
Each domain received a partial score based on the punctuation observed divided by the number of categories of that domain. The score of each domain is added to the others
Total scores ranged from 23.4 to 100 The scores considered “cut points” to determine whether a patient had/had not anxiety were 23
Without anxiety: 23.4 e 30
With anxiety: greater than 30.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Parental Anxiety at Postinduction of Anesthesia</title>
        <description>The investigators measure change of parental anxiety using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological inventory and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis.
The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic.
Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.
Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored.
Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety.</description>

        <description>The investigators measure postoperative emergence delirium of children after recovery of anesthesia using Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain(CHEOP) Scale at 20 minute in postanesthetic care unit
The CHEOPS (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale) is a behavioral scale for evaluating postoperative pain in young children. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions for reducing the pain and discomfort.
CHEOPS pain score = SUM(points for all 6 parameters) : Cry, facila, Child verbal, Torso, Touch, legs
Interpretation:
minimum score: 4 = no pain
maximum score: 13 = the worst pain
When the highest CHEOPS score recorded at any time exceeded 10, emergence delirium was deemed to be present.</description>

The PHBQ consists of 27 items concerning sleep, eating, anxiety, aggressive behaviour, etc.
The subscales were: general anxiety and regression, separation anxiety, anxiety about sleep, eating disturbance, aggression towards authority, and withdrawal.
Negative behavior change was evaluated in 6 subscales categories. If more than one negative behavior change developed, the investigators calculated number of children who developed new-onset negative behavior change.</description>
