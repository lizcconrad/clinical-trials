    <textblock>
      The study &quot;&quot;Nutritional trial with fortified milk in 65+ years old subjects&quot; is a part of a
      complex research project and multi-sectoral development (MIAO 50) with the participation of
      University Research Institutes and small and medium Italian enterprises.

      The general objective of the call is to promote the collaboration between the best scientific
      knowledge, both epidemiological and experimental, and the most advanced technologies to
      develop foods with a nutritional profile adequate to the needs of consumers with an age over
      50 years old, which are easy to use and make it possible to eat in a healthy manner, complete
      and balanced and also meets the quality and flavors of traditional Italian.

      Aging is associated with a functional decline of most physiological systems including the
      immune system. It could be hypothesized that an inadequate nutritional status may amplify the
      effects of a low-grade chronic inflammation associated with age influencing the functionality
      of the immune systems, the resistance to infections, the cognitive function and contributing
      to an increased morbidity and mortality. Indeed experimental evidence indicate that improving
      the nutritional status attenuates the decline in immune and cognitive functions, in physical
      performance associated with age by helping to improve the level of Quality of Life.

      Therefore, the present study focus on nutrients and micronutrient which have a role in
      fighting oxidative stress, in the regulation of inflammatory responses and the immune system.
