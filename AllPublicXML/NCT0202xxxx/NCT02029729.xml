      This proposed first-in-human study (408-C-1303) is designed to assess the safety, maximum
      tolerated dose, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in patients
      with advanced solid tumors that are refractory after standard of care therapy for the
      disease. The results of this study will help provide clinical information for the design and
      conduct of further clinical studies with RTA 408 in cancer patients.

Doses will increase by 100% of previous dose (e.g., 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, etc.) until such time the Protocol Safety Review Committee decreases the escalation rate to 50% of the previous dose (e.g., 20 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, etc). Dose escalation will continue until Maximum Tolerated Dose is identified.</description>

          3. Patients must have experienced disease recurrence or progression during or after prior
             treatment with one or more prior standard systemic therapies;

          4. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overactivity mutations or
             anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements must have received tyrosine-kinase
             inhibitor (TKI) therapy prior to consideration for enrollment;

          5. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months;

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2;

          7. Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and recovered from all acute toxic
             effects of prior systemic therapy (except alopecia) to grade ≤1;

          8. Have adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function at screening as follows:

               1. Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L,
                  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve
                  this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. The first dose of
                  study drug must not begin until 5 days after the erythrocyte transfusion);

               2. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN, ALT and AST ≤ ULN;

               3. Renal: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the modification of diet
                  in renal disease (MDRD) formula ≥ 50 mL/min;

          9. Willing to practice methods of birth control (both males who have partners of
             childbearing potential and females of childbearing potential) from screening through 3
             months after taking the final dose of RTA 408;

         10. Female patients of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, and

             disease;

             pre- existing chronic diarrhea CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 of any etiology. Included are
