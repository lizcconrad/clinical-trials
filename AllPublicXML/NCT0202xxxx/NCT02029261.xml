  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine important and significant problems, that of insulin
      resistance and muscle wasting after burn injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury induces insulin resistance and our investigators have previous shown the
      importance of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated pathways. This project will
      establish the inhibitory effects of burn injury on IRS-1 mediated signaling in human skeletal
      muscle of burn patients.
