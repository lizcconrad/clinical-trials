    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a collaborative care approach to
      improving outpatient treatment for inactivity, chronic pain and depression as a way of
      improving overall Quality of Life for patients with SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with SCI were treated by a care manager who worked in collaboration with the
      participant's physician to decrease pain, decrease depression symptoms, and/or to increase
      physical activity. This was done by collaborating on current treatments to make sure that
      they are being as effective as possible and by providing non-pharmacological treatments.
