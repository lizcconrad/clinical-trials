  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to identify new virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus
      lugdunensis that can be associated with clinical sign of severe infections and identified
      symptoms. The methodological approach is based on the comparison between the production of
      toxins by a given S. lugdunensis isolate classified in patients groups according to the
      infection clinically defined. Each group will be compared to the presence or not of studied
      virulence factors. Clinical features associated with toxin activity are not known for S.
      lugdunensis. This comparative approach is based on the hypotheses that drove to the
      definition of patient groups and their clinical criteria. However, in the absence of the
      evident correlation between production of toxins and kind of infection, the statistical
      evaluation will be completed by a multi-varied analysis. This approach has not been choosen
      first because of the multiple parameters that undergo during infection that may reveal
      relationships without true correlation. About the number of included patients in each defined
      group, if one of them does not reach the expected count, we still might extend inclusions to
      3-6 months more. The presence of severe infections without usually defined risk is
      intriguing. For these last patients, we have planned, after their individual consent to
      achieve an exome sequencing. The obtained data will be compared to available resources for
      the human genome. By filtering data through usual protocols, we hope to able to focus onto
      few genes that evoke specific sensitivity to infections, e.g. severe endocarditis due to S.
      lugdunensis without defined risk.

    <description>Several groups will be compared considering the presence/absence of virulence factors:
Bacteriemic VS non bacteriemic, Deep infection VS Skin/mucosal infection, Foreign body infection VS not, Presence of abscess VS not, Sepsis VS no sepsis, Septic embolism VS not, Portal of entry or not
The following virulence factors will be searched for:
TSST-1, enterotoxins, leukotoxins, epidermolysins, beta-hemolysins, SCIN-CHIPS, Sbi, Efb, SdrE</description>
