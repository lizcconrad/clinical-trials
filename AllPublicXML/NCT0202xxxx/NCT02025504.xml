  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold-standard for colorectal cancer screening in the US. However, complete
      colonoscopy can be a challenging technical procedure, even for expert gastroenterologists due
      to variations in patient anatomy, tortuous colons, and looping of the endoscope. Such
      obstacles can prolong colonoscopy, lead to complications, decrease polyp detection, and
      impact patient experience and tolerance. The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy
      of a new non-invasive abdominal binder (ColoWrap®) in improving the performance and tolerance
      of colonoscopy by way of a randomized, blinded clinical trial. Eligible participants
      undergoing colonoscopy at University of North Carolina Hospitals (UNCH) will be recruited for
      the study and randomized to either the ColoWrap intervention or sham arm. Colonoscopy will be
      performed per usual operating procedures. The primary outcome will be time to distal extent
      (cecal intubation time). Secondary outcomes include colonoscopy completion rate, use of
      ancillary maneuvers, medication usage, procedural difficulty, patient comfort, and operator
      and assistant fatigue and pain. Efficacy will be assessed on the basis of pairwise
      comparisons between groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.
