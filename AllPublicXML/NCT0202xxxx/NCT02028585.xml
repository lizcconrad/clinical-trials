    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-fat milk consumption on metabolic
      parameters and biomarkers related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function
      in Korean adults with metabolic syndrome.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary intervention study was designed. Subjects with
      metabolic syndrome and body mass index ≥23 kg/m2 were randomized to the low-fat milk group,
      which were instructed to consume 2 packs of low-fat milk per day (200 mL twice daily) for 6
      weeks, and the control group was instructed to maintain their habitual diet. Metabolic
      markers were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were enrolled if their body mass index (BMI) was ≥23 kg/m2 and they met the
             criteria for metabolic syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who were allergic to milk; those who had a history of digestive disorder; those
             with a medical history of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases,
             valvular heart diseases, heart failure, or stroke; those who had cancer in the past 5
             years; those who were taking hypoglycemic agents for diabetes mellitus; those who had
             chronic disease such as renal failure or liver cirrhosis; and those with a hemoglobin
             A1c (HbA1c) level ≥ 7% were excluded from the research. People who had a weight change
             &gt; 5% of the total weight within the past 3 months, those who had started taking or had
             changed their dose of anti-hypertensive agents or medications for dyslipidemia within
             the previous 1 month, those who had a newly diagnosed dyslipidemia requiring drug
             treatment, those who had taken steroids either orally or by injection within the
             previous 3 months, those who were pregnant or were expecting to become pregnant; and
             those who regularly consumed milk in quantities ≥ 200 mL per day at least 3 times a
             week on average were also excluded.
