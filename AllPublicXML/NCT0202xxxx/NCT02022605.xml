    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that coached EMS practice at the beginning of ERCP
      training could improve the trainees' skill. However, it is not known whether continuously
      coached practice using EMS can provide additional benefit.

    <description>A trainer (SAH) gave a series of demonstrations of the proper techniques of ERCP step by step on the EMS. The demonstration included selective cannulation, sphincterotomy, guidewire exchange, balloon dilation, stone extraction and stent insertion. Then trainees practiced each technique with hands-on coaching from the trainer on the EMS. Each trainee could repeate the practice with the trainer giving only verbal correction of any errors for about 30min.</description>

    <description>The standard cannulation technique was used with a sphincterotome preloaded with a guidewire, positioned in the ampullary orifice, and targeting the presumed entry of CBD or PD. During the whole procedure of cannulation by trainees, the senior endoscopist would actively communicate with trainees through verbal and/or hands-on assistance to help them to make the performance more correctly. If the trainees failed to enter the targeted duct within 10min, the senior endoscopist would take over the duodenoscope and continue the following procedure of cannulation.</description>
