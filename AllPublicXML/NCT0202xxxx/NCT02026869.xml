      Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of irregular periods, poor ovulation and delay in
      achieving pregnancy. Certain drugs may help improve ovarian activity in such women as
      metformin. Oral administration of metformin is accompanied by undesirable side effects. The
      vagina proved to be a good alternative to the oral route for other drugs. Using metformin
      through the vagina and avoidance of such side effects, while maintaining its effectiveness,
      would help women to better tolerate this drug.

      PCOS is the most common of all female endocrinopathies affecting 7-10% of women. A variety of
      drugs have been used to help improve follicular dynamics in PCOS patients. Metformin, an
      insulin sensitizer long known for its antidiabetic properties, has been used in PCOS
      patients. One of the major factors affecting compliance are the gastrointestinal side effects
      associated with oral administration of metformin. Knowing that the vagina is a good
      absorptive surface for many drugs, it is postulated that vaginal administration of metformin
      could be a good alternative to the oral route, if it proves effective. Both pharmacokinetic
      and clinical evidences of efficacy are traced for the vaginal route of administration.
