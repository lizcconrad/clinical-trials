  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on the health of
      patients and their families. The shared environment of spouses/cohabitating partners suggests
      that patients' families are exposed to the extensive diet and lifestyle changes required of
      patients following bariatric surgery.

      The specific aims of this proposal are to:

        1. Collect clinical data (e.g., weight, blood pressure, body composition, blood sample), as
           well as monitor physical activity and eating patterns, before and after bariatric
           surgery (Adults Only).

        2. Analyze clinical data, physical activity and eating patterns to determine how the health
           of patients and their families change after one family member completes bariatric
           surgery (Adults Only).

        3. Determine the feasibility of recruiting patients, spouses/partners and their children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who receive surgery have been cleared medically and psychosocially for

          -  Cohabitation with patients will be considered inclusion criteria for partners/spouses.

          -  Children between the ages of ≥5 - ≤ 16, who cohabitate with the patient the majority
             of the time will be asked to participate by providing assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Report current or planned use of weight loss medications (including OTC), or other
             weight loss strategy.
