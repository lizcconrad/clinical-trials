      The study proposed by SSCVD Allogeneic Stem Cells of this Hospital provides for the
      collection of a series composed of patients with multiple myeloma undergoing allogeneic stem
      cell transplants at our center in the period 2000-2011.

      This collection is carried out with retrospective investigation , through the review of paper
      and electronic records and data cards already collected as part of clinical trials conducted
      by our own Division and approved by the Ethics Committee of Management.

      The purpose of data collection is particularly retrospective analysis of the incidence of
      extramedullary relapse , the response in flow cytometry immunophenotypic and clinical
      response of the disease , will also be taken into consideration for overall survival ( OS) ,
      event-free survival (EFS) , the cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality and
      graft- versus-host disease ( GVHD ), acute and chronic.

      The data were processed in a completely anonymous and as provided by law. The results of the
      study will not result in any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention on patients still alive.
