  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes patients have been proved to have decreased of glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) levels. Incretin based therapy is associated with improved glycemic control by
      boosting GLP-1 levels . Nevertheless, the clinical effects are in great diversity for poorly
      controlled Type 2 diabetes patients. This study is designed to understand the pharmacological
      effects and genetic variation of incretin based therapy on type 2 diabetes.

      Background:

      Since GLP-1 receptor is encoded by GLP1R ( glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) gene,
      individuals may veritably respond to incretion based treatment, depending on the presence or
      absence of minor alleles characterized by single nucleotide polymorphisms. The genotyping of
      patients will be performed to compare the genetic factors and the pharmacological effects.

      Expected Results: How to select a anti-diabetic drug tailored to the individual becomes more
      and more important because the enormously increasing classes of treatment modality. This
      study could be of great help in recommending the best possible agent for an individual,
      improving the possibility of treatment success, and justifying if the need of expensive drugs
      in a given patient.
