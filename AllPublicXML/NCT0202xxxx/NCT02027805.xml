  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a combination of two antibodies both conjugated to a cell-killing toxin
      (so-called immunotoxins) will be evaluated. The antibodies are directed against T-cell
      antigens 'cluster of differentiation 3 antigen' (CD3) and CD7. Previous in vitro studies have
      demonstrated that this particular immunotoxin-combination, named T-Guard, acts
      synergistically in eliminating T cells with a preference for killing activated T-cells. In a
      subsequent clinical pilot-study, T-Guard has generated encouraging results when applied as
      third-line therapy for patients suffering form steroid-resistant acute Graft-versus-Host
      Disease (GVHD). Extensive biological and clinical responses could be noted in the absence of
      severe acute toxicities. Building on these results, the current study aims at evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of T-Guard for treating steroid-resistant GVHD when administered in an
      earlier phase of the disease process, i.e. as second-line instead of as third-line therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is a bicentric non-controlled fixed-dose Phase I/II study. A total of
      20 adult patients with acute steroid-resistant GVHD will be enrolled in a 12 months period.
      The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions T-Guard (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours
      apart over a 4-hour period. The intended follow-up period is 6 months.

      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of T-Guard, 4 weeks after the first
      infusion (Day 28), in inducing an objective clinical response in patients with acute GVHD
      refractory to standard first line corticosteroid therapy.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of T-Guard during the first 6 months after
           imitation of therapy;

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of T-Guard;

        -  To determine the immunogenicity of T-Guard.

      Exploratory objectives are:

        -  To study the specificity and kinetics of the treatment-induced depletion and subsequent
           repopulation of lymphocyte subsets;

        -  To evaluate diagnostic and predictive GVHD biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.
