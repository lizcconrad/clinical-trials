    <textblock>
      This quality improvement project is focused on improving hypertension care delivery processes
      in ambulatory clinical practices, 5 in Illinois and 5 in Maryland for a total of 10 practice
      sites.The primary aim of this quality improvement project is to improve blood pressure
      control among patients receiving routine care for hypertension in a diverse group of
      ambulatory clinical practices. A secondary aim is for American Medical Association (AMA) and
      Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) quality improvement staff to figure out the best way to help
      clinical practices in achieving improved blood pressure control, including working to
      increase the use of home blood pressure monitoring.

        This quality improvement project will be conducted in 10 ambulatory practice sites that are
        distinguished by their medical specialty and practice size. There are 9 diverse sites that
        specialize in family medicine and internal medicine. One site is a cardiology practice.
        Practices range in size from a mid-size medical group to a single-physician practice. The
        total number of physicians participating in this project is between 40 and 50. The sites
        are located in various neighborhoods in the Chicago and Baltimore metropolitan areas and in
        rural Maryland. The patient populations of the sites are representative of the United
        States population.
