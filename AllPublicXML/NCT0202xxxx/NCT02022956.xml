    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PK properties, tolerability, and safety of
      lorcaserin HCL (BELVIQ) in obese adolescent subjects between the ages of 12 to 17 years old

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to:

        1. Assess the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lorcaserin and a primary
           metabolites (M1 and M5) in obese adolescent subjects ages 12-17 (inclusive)

        2. Assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of lorcaserin in obese
           adolescent subjects ages 12-17 (inclusive)
