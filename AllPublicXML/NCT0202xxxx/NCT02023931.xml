  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study has been designed to determine (primary objective) if three brief interventions
      with three oral BSE regimens will alter mRNA biomarkers of Nrf2 pathway signaling, including
      NQO1, GSTs and AKRs, in the oral mucosa of healthy subjects. Quantitative distribution data
      and preliminary effect size for specific Nrf2 targets, as measured in serial buccal cell
      scrapings, will be determined during the course of 3-day exposures to three BSE regimens.
      These data will inform the design of a randomized, phase II chemoprevention trial in patients
      with HPV-negative HNSCC.

      Ten healthy volunteers will be recruited for this pilot study, Age ≥ 18 years, both male and
      female: 1) The non-cancer population presenting to the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear
      Institute or the Hillman Cancer Center. This may include patients with benign disease or
      their friends/family members, or friends/family members of patients with cancer; 2)
      Professionals, staff, or students at the University of Pittsburgh.

      Intervention 1, GRR-BSE

      If eligible, participants may undergo baseline visit procedures immediately following the
      screening visit (same day). If necessary for logistical purposes, participants may return for
      the baseline visit and initiation of the first BSE intervention any time during the 14 days
      following eligibility assessment. At the baseline visit (day 1), participants will undergo
      baseline blood and buccal cell collection. Blood collection will be performed by a trained
      phlebotomist. Buccal cell collection will be conducted by a trained research coordinator, the
      principal investigator, or a co-investigator. Participants will receive written and verbal
      instructions and an intervention diary for documentation of the BSE drink, details of the
      intervention timeline, including overnight voids, blood and buccal cell collection, and days
      of GRR-BSE consumption. Participants will receive a list of brassica vegetables and
      condiments to avoid during each study intervention. Participants will also receive a list of
      CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors that must be avoided during the study intervention. For
      overnight voids, participants will be instructed to begin collecting urine at 5 pm, and to
      collect all urine through the first morning void on the following day. The intervention diary
      will have space for participants to record the date and time of each GRR-BSE consumption, and
      space for subjective comments regarding taste and tolerability. Participants will be provided
      with: 1) a collection bottle for overnight urine collection; 2) three frozen GRR-BSE
      beverages in an insulated cooler bag with a frozen blue-ice block; 3) the intervention diary
      and instructions, as stated above.

      Participants will store the frozen GRR-BSE beverages in their home freezer. On the evening of
      day 1, participants will collect a baseline overnight void which will be returned to the
      study team on day 2. Each evening for 3 evenings (days 2-4; between 5pm and 8pm),
      participants will thaw and consume one GRR-BSE beverage. Beverages may be thawed at room
      temperature for 1-2 hours, or in a lukewarm (70-80°F) water bath for 20-30 minutes.
      Participants will record the time of consumption on the intervention diary. AE assessment and
      buccal cell collections will be conducted on days 3, 4, and 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm) by a
      study investigator or trained research coordinator. On the evening of day 4, participants
      will collect an overnight void which will be returned to the study team on day 5 along with
      the intervention diary. Blood collection will occur again on day 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm).

      Participants will then undergo a minimum 3 day washout. Day 5 of the intervention, which does
      not include a GRR-BSE dose, counts as the first day of the washout period.

      Intervention 2, SFR-BSE

      At the baseline visit for intervention 2 (day 1), participants will undergo baseline blood
      and buccal cell collection. Blood collection will be performed by a trained phlebotomist.
      Buccal cell collection will be conducted by a trained research coordinator, the principal
      investigator, or a co-investigator. Participants will receive written and verbal instructions
      and an intervention diary for documentation of the SFR-BSE drink, details of the intervention
      timeline, including overnight voids, blood and buccal cell collection, and days of SFR-BSE
      consumption. Participants will receive a list of brassica vegetables and condiments to avoid
      during each study intervention. Participants will also receive a list of CYP3A4 inducers and
      inhibitors that must be avoided during the study intervention. For overnight voids,
      participants will be instructed to begin collecting urine at 5 pm, and to collect all urine
      through the first morning void on the following day. The intervention diary will have space
      for participants to record the date and time of each SFR-BSE consumption, and space for
      subjective comments regarding taste and tolerability. Participants will be provided with: 1)
      a collection bottle for overnight urine collection, including instructions for collection; 2)
      three frozen SFR-BSE beverages in an insulated cooler bag with a frozen blue-ice block; 3)
      the intervention diary and instructions, as stated above.

      Participants will store the frozen SFR-BSE beverages in their home freezer. On the evening of
      day 1, participants will collect a baseline overnight void which will be returned to the
      study team on day 2. Each evening for 3 evenings (days 2-4; between 5pm and 8pm),
      participants will thaw and consume one SFR-BSE beverage. Beverages may be thawed at room
      temperature for 1-2 hours, or in a lukewarm (70-80°F) water bath for 20-30 minutes.
      Participants will record the time of consumption on the intervention diary. AE assessment and
      buccal cell collections will be conducted on days 3, 4, and 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm) by a
      study investigator or a trained research coordinator. On the evening of day 4, participants
      will collect an overnight void which will be returned to the study team on day 5 along with
      the intervention diary. Blood collection will occur again on day 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm).

      Participants will then undergo a minimum 3 day washout. Day 5 of the intervention, which does
      not include a SFR-BSE dose, counts as the first day of the washout period.

      Intervention 3, SFR-BSE(T)

      At the baseline visit for intervention 3 (day 1), participants will undergo baseline blood
      and buccal cell collection. Blood collection will be performed by a trained phlebotomist.
      Buccal cell collection will be conducted by a trained research coordinator, the principal
      investigator, or a co-investigator. Participants will receive written and verbal instructions
      and an intervention diary for documentation of the SFR-BSE (T) application, details of the
      intervention timeline, including overnight voids, blood and buccal cell collection, and days
      of SFR-BSE (T) application. Participants will receive a list of brassica vegetables and
      condiments to avoid during each study intervention. Participants will also receive a list of
      CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors that must be avoided during the study intervention. For
      overnight voids, participants will be instructed to begin collecting urine at 5 pm, and to
      collect all urine through the first morning void on the following day. Participants will be
      explicitly instructed that intervention 3 is topical application only. Participants will be
      instructed to take one mouthful (approximately 30 mL or 1/3 of the dose) of the SFR-BSE(T)
      beverage, swish, gargle, and hold in the mouth for 2-3 minutes then spit out. This will be
      repeated twice (for a total of 3 swish, gargle, hold and spit applications) until the
      beverage is gone, aiming for a total exposure time of 6-8 minutes. The intervention diary
      will have space for participants to record the date, time and duration of each SFR-BSE(T)
      topical application, and space for subjective comments regarding taste and tolerability.
      Participants will be provided with: 1) a collection bottle for overnight urine collection,
      including instructions for collection; 2) three frozen SFR-BSE (T) beverages in an insulated
      cooler bag with a frozen blue-ice block; 3) the intervention diary and instructions, as
      stated above.

      Participants will store the frozen SFR-BSE(T) beverages in their home freezer. On the evening
      of day 1, participants will collect a baseline overnight void which will be returned to the
      study team on day 2. Each evening for 3 evenings (days 2-4; between 5pm and 8pm),
      participants will thaw and consume one SFR-BSE beverage. Beverages may be thawed at room
      temperature for 1-2 hours, or in a lukewarm (70-80°F) water bath for 20-30 minutes.
      Participants will record the time and duration of each topical application on the
      intervention diary. AE assessment and buccal cell collections will be conducted on days 3, 4,
      and 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm) by a study investigator. On the evening of day 4, participants
      will collect an overnight void which will be returned to the study team on day 5 along with
      the intervention diary. Blood collection will occur again on day 5 (between 8 am and 1 pm).

    <measure>Determine the modulation of the Nrf2 pathway in response to short term exposure to three BSE regimens</measure>
    <time_frame>Three to 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is limited to obtaining preliminary estimates of Nrf2 pathway modulation from buccal cell specimens samples all collected during each of the three 5 day intervention periods. Endpoints include mRNA transcript levels of certain genes or enzymes regulated by Nrf2.
Note that the goals of this study are limited to obtaining initial pharmacodynamic estimates of Nrf2 pathway modulation for each BSE intervention. Accordingly, no hypothesis testing or comparative analyses are planned. The data collected in this pilot study may be used to plan a future definitive prevention trial.</description>

    <description>Three different regimens of BSE delivery will be evaluated in each participant, with participants serving as their own controls. Each regimen will involve a 3 day exposure, with daily collection of buccal cell scrapings. Between regimens, a minimum 3 day (72 hour) washout period will occur.</description>

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Broccoli Sprout Extract (BSE)</intervention_name>
    <description>The first regimen will involve oral delivery and ingestion of 600 μmole doses of glucoraphanin-rich BSE (GRR-BSE), and will represent systemic delivery of sulforaphane to oral mucosa, due to the necessity to metabolize GRR-BSE in the gut.
The second regimen will involve oral delivery and ingestion of 100 μmole doses of sulforaphane-rich BSE (SFR-BSE), which will represent a combination of systemic and topical delivery to the oral mucosa.
The third regimen will isolate topical exposure of the oral mucosa to sulforaphane. Participants will swish, hold, then spit 100 μmole doses of SFR-BSE. This regimen (SFR-BSE(T)) will theoretically isolate the pharmacodynamic impact of topical exposure of the oral mucosa to sulforaphane.</description>
