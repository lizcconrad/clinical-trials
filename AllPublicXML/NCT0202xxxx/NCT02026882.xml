  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway (SLMA) is a single use supraglottic device that provides a
      good seal for positive pressure ventilation and good first attempt insertion rate of 98% in
      low risk patients undergoing elective Caesarean section. It has a double aperture design that
      facilitates the introduction of an orogastric tube to aspirate gastric contents.

      The primary study hypothesis is the first attempt insertion success rate of SLMA use in
      urgent Caesarean section.

      Investigators propose a prospective cohort study to study the first attempt insertion success
      rate of supreme LMA in general anaesthesia for urgent caesarean section.
