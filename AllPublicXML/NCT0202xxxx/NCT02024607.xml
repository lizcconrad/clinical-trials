      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of BBI608 administered
      in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with
      and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan. A study cycle will consist of daily
      and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with
      FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or
