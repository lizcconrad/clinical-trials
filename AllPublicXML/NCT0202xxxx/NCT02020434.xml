  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RPX7009(beta-lactamase inhibitor) is being studied in combination with carbapenem (RPX2014)to
      treat bacterial infections, including those due to multi-drug resistant bacteria.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly
      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of
      hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine
      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable
      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2014) plus a new
      beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases,
      including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of intravenous RPX2014 and RPX7009, administered in combination in subjects with varying
      degrees of renal insufficiency.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged 18 through 80 years of age

          2. Willing to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to dosing through discharge

          3. Normal volunteer first matched by age (± 10 years), BMI (± 20%), and gender to the
             mean values of the moderate renal insufficiency group.

          4. Have negative test results for HBsAg, anti-HCV antibody and anti-HIV antibody.

          5. Voluntarily consent to participate in the study

          6. Sexually abstinent or agree to use two approved methods of contraception.

          7. Assessment of renal insufficiency for assignment to study groups will be based on
             measurements of eGFR calculated by the MDRD equation at the Screening Visit to
             determine eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable or new medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, autoimmune, endocrine, or neurological disorders)

          2. Hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins,
             cephalosporins, or carbapenems)

          3. History of clinically significant seizures, head injury, or meningitis.

          4. Current evidence or history of malignancy, excluding basal cell carcinoma, in the 2
             years prior to Day -1 with no evidence of recurrence.

          5. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or have a positive pregnancy test

          6. Previously received any dose of Carbavance (RPX2014/RPX7009).

             investigational clinical study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.

             1.

             serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis
