    <textblock>
      Philips Healthcare has added a virtual path planner to the current commercially available
      XperGuide software platform and that has the potential to significantly reduce dose during
      image-guided needle interventions.

    <description>Evaluate the workflow, usability, and clinical impact of device by assessing clinical outcome and success of the procedures.
The SUS is a simple, ten-item attitude Likert scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability developed by Brooke, J. The user needs to provide agreement or disagreement for the 10 statements. After the appearing of the SUS in literature and once part of the ISO standard ISO 9241 Part 11 it has become an industry standard and has been used for over 25 years to measure usability.
The minimum score is 0 and the maximum core is 100. Analysis of 500 studies with SUS showed that the average SUS score is a 68. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average</description>
