  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National Health Insurance Administration, Taiwan has provided a protocol for community
      pharmacist to offer home pharmaceutical care for the patients with high health expenditures.
      Since community pharmacists need to visit patients for consultation and check their
      medications, it has been thought to have pressure for them in various areas. This study
      intends to investigate the factors related to the pressure and intention for leaving this
      protocol. The hypothesis are that community pharmacist who works longer, has economic
      pressure, and longer year of practice will have higher pressure and strong intention for
      leaving.
