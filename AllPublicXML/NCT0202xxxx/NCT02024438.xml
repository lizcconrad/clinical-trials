  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For gastric patients of Karnofsky scores between 60-80 scores, mFolfox6 is an option for
      chemotherapy. Neutropenia and oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity are the most common adverse
      effects which even result in discontinue of chemotherapy, especially for patients suffered
      from heavily acute neurotoxicity. Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside is a component of membrane
      of nerve cells. Previous phase II clinical trial showed, it can reduce oxaliplatin-induced
      neurotoxicity(OIN). But it did not certificated by phase III trial. A phase III trial is
      needed to investigate the effect and safety of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside Sodium
      Injection for prevention OIN at gastric cancer.
