  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomised, 4-way crossover study in twelve healthy male volunteers.

      The study will characterise the performance of IntelliCap® by evaluating the plasma
      concentration and pharmacokinetic profile of a probe drug (IMP; metoprolol) released from
      IntelliCap® with three different release profiles and the plasma concentration and
      pharmacokinetic profile of the same probe drug after a single dose of an oral solution.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers aged between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subjects with a body weight of at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg, inclusive.

          -  Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 - 30 kg/m2, inclusive. BMI = Body weight
             (kg) / [Height (m)]2.

          -  Subjects with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture.

          -  Subjects must be available to complete the study.

          -  Subjects must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the
             study.

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Abnormal vital signs, after 10 min supine rest, defined as any of the following:

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg.

          -  Diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg.

          -  Heart rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 85 beats per minute.

          -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             resting ECG.

          -  History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or on-going clinically important allergy/
             hypersensitivity as judged by the Investigator or known hypersensitivity to metoprolol
             (including other beta-blockers) or any other component of the product.

             •Plasma donation within one month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss
             greater than 500 mL during the three (3) months prior to screening.

          -  Receipt of a new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved
             for marketing) or participation in any other clinical study that includes drug
             treatment within at least three (3) months of the first administration of study
             treatment in this study. The period of exclusion begins three months after the final
             dose. Note: subjects consented and screened, but not randomised in this study or a
             previous phase I study, are not excluded.

          -  Previous randomisation to treatment in the present study.

          -  Involvement of any CRO/third party contractor or AZ employee and their close relatives
             regardless of their role.

          -  Judgement by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any on-going or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

          -  Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.
