  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having previously demonstrated that supplemental parenteral nutrition to complete an
      insufficient enteral nutrition (EN) between D4 and D8 improves outcome after critical
      illness, by reducing infectious complications, the present trial aims at investigating the
      underlying carbohydrate and protein metabolism changes, as well as the immune and
      inflammatory modulations associated with this improvement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment on day 3 of critically ill patients, without contraindication to EN, not achieving
      60% of the ICU per protocol energy target.

      Intervention: Randomization to either continued pure EN, or from day 4 to supplemental PN to
      complete EN at target validated by indirect calorimetry.

      Measurements: Indirect calorimetry on Days 3, 4, 9 (twice). Primary endpoints = glucose and
      leucine metabolism On days 4 and 9-10: isotopic investigation of glucose metabolism, and
      immune and inflammatory responses// Day 9-10: isotopic investigation of protein (leucine)
      metabolism Secondary endpoints: Insulin requirements, area under the curve (AUC) of blood
      Glucose, infections after day 9, overall complications, length of mechanical ventilation, of
      ICU and hospital stay.
