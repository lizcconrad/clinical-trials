  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality is currently used as a therapeutic strategy in common phobia as agoraphobia
      or acrophobia, since it permits to have a better control (on occurrence of events or on the
      environment) during the therapy than in &quot;in vivo&quot; therapy. Our hypothesis here is that we can
      improves the therapeutic effects of the virtual exposure by giving control to acrophobic
      patients during their exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the exposure of acrophobic patients to virtual environments. During the
      study, several groups of patients will be distributed according to different conditions:
      exposure to anxiogenous virtual environments and exposure with the ability to control and
      secure the anxiogenous virtual environments.

      The interest of this project is to improve therapy by exposure to virtual reality. Our
      project offers a systematic therapeutic approach (using virtual reality and the concept of
      control) where current therapy are too often approximate. We aim to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the control of virtual environments on symptomatic and psychophysiological
      levels, to evaluate the adoption of these methods in the couple patients-caregivers and also
      to understand the brain mechanisms (including those prefrontal) involved in this therapy.
