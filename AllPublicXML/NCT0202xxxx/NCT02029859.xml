      Main objective:

      Determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) in late pregnancy in a
      population of obese patients .

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Identify risk factors for OSA during pregnancy (age, parity, high blood pressure,
           snoring , weight, neck circumference, scores on symptoms of sleep apnea, ... ) .

        -  Compare perinatal morbidity among obese patients with OSA in late pregnancy with
           case-controls.

        -  Evaluate the evolution of a moderate or severe OSA 6 months after pregnancy.

      Material and methods

      Characteristics of the study:

        -  Interventional biomedical research

        -  Prospective Multicenter nonrandomized study

      Flow chart

        -  Patients will be included between 30 and 36 weeks of amenorrhea (WA) .

        -  Will rated from inclusion: age, parity, weight, height, BMI in early pregnancy, neck
           circumferrence, treated high blood pressure.

        -  As recommended in France, the main test results during the pregnancy follow-up will be
           recorded.

        -  At the inclusion visit will be conducted a Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Score.

        -  Screening for OSA by nocturnal polysomnography will be performed between 30 and 36WA.
           This screening can be performed as an outpatient.

        -  In case of proven OSA patients will be offered an appropriate care by today's standards.

        -  Whatever the outcome of pregnancy, a second polysomnography will be performed 6 months
           after childbirth in case of OSA during pregnancy.
