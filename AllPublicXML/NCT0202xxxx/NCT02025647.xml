  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innerview can address some of the challenges of integrating mental health and primary care by
      accurately and reliably collecting mental health evidence and activities directly from
      patients, and then organizing and automating that evidence and activity into reports for
      providers and care teams that support diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of the
      mental health issues within a practice population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To deliver integrated quality care, innovative strategies are needed to efficiently collect,
      understand, monitor and manage mental health evidence and its contribution to the primary
      care office visit. Computer applications can provide solutions to providers by helping their
      processes to be feasible, manageable, and sustainable. We hypothesize that by both providing
      patients the opportunity to reflect on their physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms and
      functioning, and giving providers accurate, reliable, current, symptom-based mental health
      evidence in an accessible organized format prior to the face-to-face visit, Innerview will
      enhance diagnostic and treatment processes from both a patient- and population-based
      perspective, as well as enhance communication between patient and provider.
