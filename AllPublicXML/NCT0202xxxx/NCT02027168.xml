  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of manual physical therapy on endocrine function in women
      diagnosed as being infertile due to elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (10
      mIU/mL or higher) on days 2-5 of their menstrual cycle. It is hypothesized that the manual
      physical therapy will decrease FSH levels.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of manual physical therapy on the endocrine levels of
      women by comparison of pre- and post- treatment hormone levels (FSH, LH and Estradiol).
      Secondary measures include assessment of pain and sexual function via questionnaires.

      Hormones will be measured at prescribed time points:

        -  baseline: 30-60 days before treatment

        -  pre-treatment: 7-30 days before treatment

        -  post treatment 1: 10-30 days post treatment

        -  post treatment 2: 30-60 days post treatment

      Pain and sexual function questionnaires will be completed:

        -  baseline: 30-60 days before treatment

        -  pre-treatment: 7-30 days before treatment

        -  post treatment 1: 30 days post treatment

        -  post treatment 2: 60 days post treatment
