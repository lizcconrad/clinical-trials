    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, Phase I/II study of enadenotucirev in patients with either
      solid tumour of epithelial origin not responding to standard therapy or for whom no standard
      treatment exists (Phase I dose escalation stage Single cycle), mCRC not responding to
      standard therapy (Phase I dose escalation Repeat cycle cohort expansion stage ), mCRC not
      responding to standard therapy or advanced or metastatic bladder cancer not candidate for
      chemotherapy (Phase Ib) or mCRC in stable disease or partial response after 3-4 months of
      first line standard of care chemotherapy (Phase II).
