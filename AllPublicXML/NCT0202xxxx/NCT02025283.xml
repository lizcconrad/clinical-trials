    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare early and long term efficacy of lumbar radiofrequency
      nucleoplasty and targeted disc decompression in patients with lumbar radiculopathy who failed
      previous conventional therapy. Medical records of 37 patients undergoing targeted disc
      decompression, 36 patients undergoing lumbar radiofrequency nucleoplasty were retrospectively
      examined.Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Functional Rating Index,
      Backache index, Oswestry Lumbar Back Pain Disability Index, Rolland-Morris Lumbar Back Pain
      Questionnaire scales were used before treatment and 1,6,12 months after the procedure. North
      American Spine Society Satisfaction Scale was used at 12th month after the procedure.

    <description>Group Decompression: Patients assigned to Group Decompression. After determination of the appropriate space for the approach under fluoroscopy guidance, a 17 gauge trochar needle was advanced posterolaterally up to the center of the disc. Then site verification was done again with water soluble contrast material under floroscopy guidance. Then flexible intradiscal decompression catheter (SpineCATH®, Smith &amp; Nephew, Memphis, TN) were advanced inside the trochar needle towards the disc and decompression was performed. After being sure of achieving sufficient decompression inside the disc, the decompression device were removed under fluoroscopy guidance and the incision site was closed and the patients were recommended to have bedrest for 2 hours.</description>
