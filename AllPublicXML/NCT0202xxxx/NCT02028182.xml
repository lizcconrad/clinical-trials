  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized study to compare the diagnostic performance
      (primary) and safety (secondary) of ascending doses of hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene
      carboxaldehyde (Lyral®) 0.40 - 0.20 - 0.10 mg/cm²and a control patch (ß-cyclodextrin and
      Povidone (PVP)), in 20 adult subjects who have a clinical history of contact dermatitis and
      have tested positive (current or previous patch test) to Lyral® or Fragrance Mix 2.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who exhibit Positive Responses to each Allergen Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>3-21 days following application</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were patch tested with one experimental T.R.U.E. Test allergen panel containing 0.40 mg/cm^2, 0.20 mg/cm^2, and 0.10 mg/cm^2 of Lyral® and a negative control and a second panel containing the marketed reference allergen (20 mg of Lyral® 5%, in petrolatum). The panels were worn for approximately 48 hours. Skin reactions were assessed at 3, 4 and 21 days following application. A response is considered positive if it is graded 1+ (erythema, infiltration, discrete papules), 2+ (erythema, papules, infiltration, discrete vesicles) or 3+ (coalescing vesicles, bullous eruption) during at least one post removal visit.</description>

    <description>Subjects were patch tested with one experimental T.R.U.E. Test allergen panel containing 0.40 mg/cm^2, 0.20 mg/cm^2, and 0.10 mg/cm^2 of Lyral® and a negative control and a second panel containing the marketed reference allergen (20 mg of Lyral® 5%, in petrolatum). The panels were worn for approximately 48 hours. Skin reactions were assessed at 3, 4 and 21 days following application. Negative responses are graded no response, doubtful responses include faint macular or homogenous erythema with no infiltration and irritant responses include discrete, patchy, follicular, or homogenous erythema with no infiltration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who exhibit Irritation (tape reaction), Itching and/or Burning Resulting from Application of the Investigational and Reference Allergen Panels</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2: 48 hours after application</time_frame>
    <description>Tape irritation is graded on a 4 point scale: None (no tape irritation), Weak (faint to definite pink), Moderate (moderate erythema, definite redness) and Strong (severe erythema, very intense redness). Percentage of response will include weak, moderate and strong reactions.
Itching and Burning are graded on a 4 point scale: None (no discomfort), Weak (minimal discomfort), Moderate (definite discomfort) and Strong (significantly bothersome, possible interference with sleep or daily activity). Percentage of response will include weak, moderate and strong responses.</description>
