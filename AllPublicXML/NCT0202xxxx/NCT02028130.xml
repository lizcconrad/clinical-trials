    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects as many as 1 in 16 people over the age of 65 and reduces the
      quality of life of large numbers of people in the UK and around the world. Catheter ablation
      is a minimally invasive treatment that has been developed to help eliminate AF. Recent
      studies have identified that a particular area of the heart, namely the left atrial appendage
      (LAA), which is a pouch in the left atrium (small collecting chamber of the heart), may be
      the main source of AF in many cases. There is a clear lack of knowledge about the structure,
      anatomy, function and electrical properties of the LAA, which is fundamental to furthering
      our understanding and management of AF.

      In addition, it is well known that AF significantly increases the risk of stroke. The
      majority of strokes occur due to blood clots forming in the LAA. Traditionally, the most
      effective treatment to minimise the risk of stroke has been to thin the blood with agents
      such as warfarin. This therapy requires regular blood tests at much inconvenience to patients
      and increases the risk of bleeding complications. Recently, a large study demonstrated that
      use of an implanted device (Watchman®) to occlude the LAA is as effective as warfarin in
      preventing stroke and confers a lower mortality rate.

      We aim to investigate whether it is safe and feasible to ablate the LAA and to implant a
      Watchman® device during the same procedure in patients who are in atrial fibrillation all of
      the time.

      While catheter ablation has revolutionized the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), the
      long-term outcomes in treating persistent AF are variable, often requiring more than one
      procedure to maintain long-term freedom from AF. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins
      (PVs) is central to catheter ablation strategies, with the majority of paroxysmal AF
      recurrences being associated with reconnection of previously isolated PVs. Persistent AF is
      different, with recurrences being attributable to foci and or substrate outside the PVs,
      including the left atrial appendage (LAA). Recently, a non-randomised, consecutive study of
      987 patients undergoing repeat catheter ablation for persistent (82%) and paroxysmal (18%) AF
      has demonstrated that almost 30% of recurrences were due to an LAA focus and that the
      addition of LAA electrical isolation to a standard persistent AF ablation strategy improves
      freedom from AF.

      Percutaneous LAA occlusion has been demonstrated to be as effective as warfarin in reducing
      the risk of thromboembolic stroke in patients with AF. The combination of a standard AF
      ablation lesion set with LAA electrical isolation and LAA occlusion may be an elegant method
      of improving success rates of ablation for persistent AF whilst also mitigating stroke risk
      and reducing the bleeding risks from long-term anticoagulation. However, the feasibility and
      safety of concomitant endocardial electrical isolation and mechanical occlusion of the LAA is
      not known.

      In this study we test the hypothesis that concomitant electrical isolation of the LAA and its
      occlusion with a Watchman device, following a standard persistent AF lesion set is feasible
      and safe.
