  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We tested two interventions to improve the accuracy of medication histories obtained at
      hospital admission. The interventions target elderly and chronically ill patients prone to
      erroneous medication histories and resultant medication errors. For targeted patients, we
      tested the effect of using pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to obtain an initial
      medication history. This was studied using a randomized controlled trial of usual care (which
      involves nurses and physicians) vs usual care + pharmacists vs usual care + pharmacy
      technicians to obtain an admission medication history.

      The overarching hypothesis was that by leveraging pharmacists and pharmacy technicians we can
      minimize admission medication history errors and related downstream events.

      Importance: Admission medication history (AMH) errors frequently cause medication order
      errors and patient harm.

      Objective: To quantify AMH error reduction achieved when pharmacy staff obtain AMHs before
      admission medication orders (AMO) are placed.

      Design: Three-arm randomized clinical trial. Setting: Large hospital with community and
      trainee physicians. Population: 306 enrolled patients with complex medical histories.
      Interventions: In one intervention arm, pharmacists, and in the second intervention arm,
      pharmacy technicians obtained initial AMHs prior to admission. They obtained and reconciled
      medication information from multiple sources. All arms, including the control arm, received
      usual AMH care. This included common process variation occurring in: accuracy of pre-existing
      medication histories; nurses' ability to obtain AMHs at hospital admission; and admitting
      physicians' efforts to verify and order from prior AMHs.

      Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was severity-weighted mean AMH error score.
      To detect AMH errors, all patients received reference standard AMHs, which were compared with
      intervention and control group AMHs. AMH errors and resultant AMO errors were independently
      identified and rated by ≥2 investigators as significant, serious or life-threatening. Each
      error was assigned 1, 4 or 9 points, respectively, to calculate severity-weighted AMH and AMO
      error scores for each patient.

    <description>The primary outcome was severity-weighted mean admission medication history (AMH) error score which are weighted error counts. Significant, serious, and life-threatening errors count for 1, 4, and 9 points each, respectively. As such, higher scores indicate either more errors or errors of greater severity. The range includes integers starting with 0 (indicating zero errors) up to infinity. To detect AMH errors, all patients received reference standard AMHs, which were compared with intervention and control group AMHs. AMH errors and resultant AMO errors were independently identified and rated by ≥2 investigators as significant, serious or life-threatening.</description>

    <measure>Mean Severity-Weighted Admission Medication Order (AMO) Error Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Attempted to obtain the day after admission</time_frame>
    <description>The severity-weighted admission medication order (AMO) error score are weighted error counts. Significant, serious, and life-threatening errors count for 1, 4, and 9 points each, respectively. Higher scores indicate either more errors or errors of greater severity. The range includes integers starting with 0 (indicating zero errors) up to infinity. For each AMH error identified, two physicians independently reviewed the relevant medications ordered at hospital admission in the context of the clinical chart. They classified each AMH error as either resulting in no AMO error, or an AMO error of significant, serious, or life-threatening severity. A third physician adjudicated disagreements. In cases where the admitting physician's knowledge of an AMH error was unclear and the orders clinically reasonable, we determined the AMH error did not lead to any AMO error. Because reviewers needed chart access to determine error severity, there was no practicable way to mask study arm.</description>

        <title>Mean Severity-Weighted Admission Medication Order (AMO) Error Score</title>
        <description>The severity-weighted admission medication order (AMO) error score are weighted error counts. Significant, serious, and life-threatening errors count for 1, 4, and 9 points each, respectively. Higher scores indicate either more errors or errors of greater severity. The range includes integers starting with 0 (indicating zero errors) up to infinity. For each AMH error identified, two physicians independently reviewed the relevant medications ordered at hospital admission in the context of the clinical chart. They classified each AMH error as either resulting in no AMO error, or an AMO error of significant, serious, or life-threatening severity. A third physician adjudicated disagreements. In cases where the admitting physician's knowledge of an AMH error was unclear and the orders clinically reasonable, we determined the AMH error did not lead to any AMO error. Because reviewers needed chart access to determine error severity, there was no practicable way to mask study arm.</description>

      <desc>In terms of the Participants at Risk and similar outcomes, please note that “0” signifies that adverse events were not collected or assessed as part of the study. Also, the intervention, which involved having pharmacists and pharmacy technicians talk with patients/families/caregivers and review records in detail, was deemed to represent minimal risk.</desc>
