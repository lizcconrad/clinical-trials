  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of Curodont Repair for the
      treatment of early buccal carious lesions compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants must have two early class V carious lesions in need of a treatment but
      not of an invasive treatment (split-mouth design). One lesion will be treated with Curodont
      Repair and one with placebo as control (single application). 3 months later fluoride
      (Duraphat) will be applied on both lesions. Study duration is 9 months. For assessment visual
      and tactile evaluation, pictures, ECM, Diagnodent Pen, Canary System, VAS is used.
