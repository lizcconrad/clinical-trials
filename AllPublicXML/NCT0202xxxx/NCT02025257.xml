  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exercise for patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) aged 80 years and older, with special reference to maximum
      aerobic capacity, muscle endurance, physical functioning, level of physical activity, health
      related quality of life, anxiety, depression and endothelial function, compared to a control
      group.
