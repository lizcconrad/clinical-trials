  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiarthroplasty is a well established treatment of Femoral Neck Fractures in the Elderly.
      During the last decade the use of Minimal Invasive Surgical( MIS) approaches have been
      increasing. Our hypothesis is that Patients with a Femoral Neck Fracture may benefit from a
      MIS approach.

      The study's main objective: The purpose of the study is to test the following hypothesis.
      Patients 70 to 90 years with a displaced femoral neck fracture, operated with a
      hemiarthroplasty through an anterolateral approach, have less pain and better patient
      satisfaction as measured by PROMs than patients operated through the lateral approach.

      The study's subsidiary objectives. We aim to shed light on the following subsidiary
      hypotheses.

        1. A hemiarthroplasty inserted through an anterolateral approach gives less bone
           resorption, as measured by DEXA around the stem, than a hemiarthroplasty inserted via a
           direct lateral approach.

        2. A hemiarthroplasty inserted through an anterolateral approach causes lesser degree of
           muscle damage, as measured by CK, than a direct lateral approach
