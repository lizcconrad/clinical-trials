    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common problem after general anesthesia. The
      incidence can be as high as 80 percent in high-risk patients. Investigators designed this
      randomized, double- blind, single-center study to compare the efficacy of the combination of
      dexamethasone with ondansetron and dexamethasone with aprepitant undergoing laparoscopic
      surgery.

      Seventy American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical class I-II, age 18-60 years
      patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery were included in this study. Anesthesia was
      induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen /
      air mixture in all patients. Remifentanil was continuously infused during surgery. Patients
      were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the dexamethasone and aprepitant group
      (group DA, n=35) received 40 mg aprepitant orally 1 to 2 hours before induction of anesthesia
      and 2 ml saline intravenous (iv) within the last 30 minutes of surgery. Patients in the
      dexamethasone and ondansetron group (group DO, n=35) received an oral placebo identical to
      aprepitant 1 to 2 hours before induction of anesthesia and 4 mg ondansetron iv within the
      last 30 minutes of surgery. All patient received iv 8 mg dexamethasone after induction of
      anesthesia.

      PONV and postoperative opioid consumption were assessed for 24 hours postoperatively. The
      blindly evaluated primary outcome was complete response. The secondary outcomes were
      incidence of nausea, retching or vomiting, the need of rescue antiemetic and opioid
      consumption within 24 hours after surgery. Statistical analyses were performed using
      Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's Exact test. P&lt;0.05 was considered
      statistically significant.Investigators hypothesized that the antiemetic efficacy of the
      aprepitant and dexamethasone combination is superior compared with ondansetron and
      dexamethasone combination following the laparoscopic surgery.
