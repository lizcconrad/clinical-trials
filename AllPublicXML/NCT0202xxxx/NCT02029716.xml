  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human study of a topical dermal lotion formulation of RTA 408, a
      novel small molecule which suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, the
      safety, local pharmacodynamics (PD), and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of RTA 408 will be
      evaluated following topical application of RTA 408 Lotion to healthy volunteers. This study
      will be conducted in three parts. In Part A of the study, healthy volunteers will have RTA
      408 Lotion Vehicle and RTA 408 Lotion (0.5%, 1%, and 3%) applied to a small skin surface area
      (four individual 4-cm2 sites; 16 cm2 total area) twice daily for 14 days to assess the local
      skin tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of these treatments. Part B will be conducted
      after completion of Part A and will assess the safety, tolerability, local PD, and systemic
      PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for 14 days to a larger skin surface area
      (~100 cm2). Part C will be conducted after completion of Part B and will assess the safety,
      tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for
      28 days to a larger skin surface area (~500 cm2). The maximum tolerated drug concentration in
      Part A will be used in Part B and Part C.

      Approximately 32 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in this study with 12 volunteers
      in Part A and 10 volunteers each, in Parts B and C.
