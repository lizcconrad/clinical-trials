        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who agree to participate in this study and give written informed consent

          -  Subjects whose sitting diastolic blood pressure measured at placebo visit and baseline
             are more than 90 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure are more than 140 mmHg

          -  Subjects who are naive to anti-hypertensive treatment

          -  Subjects considered to understand the study, be cooperative, and able to be
             followed-up until the end of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             blood pressure &gt;= 110)

          -  Severe cardiac disease (heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular
             disease, moderate valvular disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, cardiomyopathy,
             etc.)

          -  Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or history

          -  Clinically significant renal dysfunction (Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL) and liver dysfunction
             (ALT, AST &gt; 2x UNL)

             negative result. Intermittent abstinence like basic body temperature method, natural
             period method are not considered admitted contraception and no hormonal contraception
             is allowed.).
