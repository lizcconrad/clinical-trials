      The prophylactic APC right after colonic EMR doesn't mean the complete coagulation of visible
      vessel because of injection material.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical feature of the visible vessels in ulcer
      base over time after prophylactic APC in colonic EMR.

      The prophylactic Argon plasma coagulation (APC) of non-bleeding visible vessels seems not to
      have an additional advantage in the prevention of delayed post polypectomy bleeding in
      recently studies. However, immediate APC after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) may not
      mean the complete coagulation of exposed vessels because of injection material. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the clinical feature of the exposed vessels in ulcer base over
      time after prophylactic APC in colonic EMR. Methods: This study was designed as a prospective
      study. Investigators excluded diminutive polyp, large polyp (&gt; 2cm), long stalk pedunculated
      polyp, and clear ulcer base after EMR. Between August 2013 and May 2014, patients who were
      enrolled underwent prophylactic APC for non-bleeding visible vessels after colonic endoscopic
      mucosal resection. After checking the complete coagulation of visible vessels, the numbers of
      visible vessel group were counted by lap of time such as 1, 3, 5, and 7 min in ulcer base.
