      This phase Ⅱ study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI as second-line
      treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are no standard second-line treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma,
      some studies have showed that irinotecan, fluorouracil may be effective in treating patients
      with metastatic esophageal carcinoma after failure of first-line treatment. Since irinotecan,
      fluorouracil, and leucovorin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor. Giving more
      than one drug may be more effective. In this phase Ⅱ trial, the investigator would like to
      observe the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI(Irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin ) as second-line
      treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma.
