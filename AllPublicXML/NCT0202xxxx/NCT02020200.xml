  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore the effect of MPH on working memory, attention and
      decision making in adults with BD in remission or in depressed state. The results will be
      compared to findings in healthy adults and adults with ADHD. The investigators hypothesize
      that MPH will incur improved performance in all measures.

      Following a detailed explanation about the trial and after obtaining informed consent from
      candidates, subjects will be asked to arrive at the cognitive laboratory at Shalvata MHC
      twice. Visits will include performance of computerized cognitive and decision making tasks,
      as well as two creativity tasks after the consumption of MPH or placebo.
