    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a safety assessment to determine the cardiac and hemodynamic
      effects of overuse of energy drinks in healthy individuals through ECG, heart rate (HR) and
      blood pressure measurements. It will evaluate the use of a consumer available product that is
      classified as a dietary supplement by the FDA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female, active duty military service members or DoD beneficiaries,
             who are eligible to receive care at DGMC.

          -  Ages 18-40 years old

          -  Participants must be willing to refrain from caffeine and energy drink use 48 hours
             prior to study days 1 and 8. They must also refrain from consuming additional caffeine
             or energy drinks during the 24-hour observation time on days 1-2 and 8-9.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiovascular risk factors: Heart rhythm other than normal sinus, history of atrial
             or ventricular arrhythmia, family history of premature sudden cardiac death before the
             age of 60, left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, hypertension, palpitations,
             T-wave abnormalities, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval greater than 440
             milliseconds(ms). This will be determined on the ECG obtained during initial screening
             appointment, and reviewed by cardiologist and through the questionnaire responses of
             the participant.

          -  Blood pressure at initial screening appointment or at baseline on study Day 1 greater
             than 140/90

          -  Presence of any known medical condition, confirmed through participant interview.
             Examples of these are:

          -  Hypertension

          -  Thyroid disease

          -  Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Recurrent headaches

          -  Depression, currently receiving treatment (due to possible drug interactions)

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous 5 years

          -  Ever been diagnosed or told they have or had renal or hepatic dysfunction

          -  Concurrent use of ANY medication taken on a daily basis, to include herbal products or
             supplements. Daily basis is defined as greater than 2 days per week.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females will be excluded from participation with urine dipstick
             tests used to confirm pregnancy (pregnancy test performed before each treatment
             session, days 1 and 8)

          -  All non-English speaking / writing subjects and those that do not understand the study
             or consent process will be excluded from the study due to unavailability of medical
             qualified translator at all times during the study.

          -  If the subject refuses to sign the informed consent document or HIPAA Authorization,
             they will be excluded as well
