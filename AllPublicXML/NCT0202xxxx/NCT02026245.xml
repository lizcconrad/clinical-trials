    <textblock>
      In this study we will compare two electronic goniometric gloves to see if they can be used in
      research on joint movement in arthritis.

      One of the gloves we will use is the commercially available '5DT Ultra 14 glove', the other
      is a glove that we have specially designed and developed for use in people with arthritis.
      Both gloves are 'high-end' gloves with sensors for all of the finger and thumb joints.

      We aim to find out if the gloves are accurate and if they can be worn and used without too
      much discomfort by people with arthritis.

    <textblock>
      This is an open pilot study to assess the usability and accuracy of two electronic
      goniometric gloves in measuring finger joint movement in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

      We will use questionnaires to assess pain, stiffness and disability. We will be using an
      inner disposable glove worn under the electronic goniometric gloves as this will be important
      for infection control in clinical use.

      We will calibrate the electronic goniometric gloves using wooden blocks at predefined angles
      using our own software calibration process to optimise the accuracy of the glove for the
      individual patient.

      The patient will flex and extend their fingers repeatedly to get measurements of the minimum
      and maximum angle of flexion in their joints. During these movements we will also capture the
      dynamic characteristics of movement such as maximum velocity. In this study a laptop will be
      used to capture and record all of the measurements from the electronic goniometric glove and
      record the time at which the measurements were taken.

      Each electronic goniometric glove will be refitted for a second set of tests to assess
      variability due to the fitting process. We will record a full set of data from each set of
      movements for later analysis.

      Finally, we will assess usability and establish if patients have a preference between the two
      electronic goniometric gloves.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The standard error of measurement for each electronic goniometric glove will be used to evaluate the reliability of each electronic goniometric glove. This will be compared to the standard error of measurement for manual goniometry.</description>

    <measure>The variability in the measurement of joint movement velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>With rapid repeated movements of finger flexion and extension, the measured maximum velocity of movement should remain fairly constant. The intraclass correlation coefficient will be used to assess the variability in the measurement of joint movement velocity.</description>

    <measure>Variability of joint angle measurements by the electronic goniometric gloves will be assessed</measure>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Electronic goniometric gloves may not be easy to don and doff in patients with arthritis, particularly if used with an inner disposable glove. Because of the small numbers we will not apply a statistical analysis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation in joint angle movement between fit and refit</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>If a electronic goniometric glove relies on accurate sensor positioning, refitting may give widely varying results. Each glove will be refitted once.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation in joint angle measurement across the range of movement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>With use of electronic goniometric gloves, joint angle measurement may be less accurate at the extremes of movement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation in joint angle movement across sensors - between digits</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Although it may be assumed that the sensors in each digit should perform equally well, the movement of the stretch sensors over the joints may vary between digits. This analysis will test for this variability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients who prefer one electronic goniometric glove over the other</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask the patient which electronic goniometric glove they prefer. This will assess usability factors such as comfort, neatness of fit, and ease of donning and doffing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The variation in joint angle measurement with force applied</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Intra class correlation test to determine if the accuracy of measurements is affected by the patient gripping tightly against a moulded object held in the palm of their hand.</description>
