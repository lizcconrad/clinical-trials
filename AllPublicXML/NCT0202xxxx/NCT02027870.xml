      1. A prospective, a single set, multicenter clinical trial;

        2. The primary in situ in patients with coronary heart disease;

        3. The center of: 28 (the actual number of center shall prevail);The plan selected 621
           patients;(where the total number of cases in 2.25 mm specification not less than 30
           cases, 5 cases each specification of not less than 2.25 mm.)

        4. Clinical follow-up time points: 1 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months of a year
           and 2 years to 5 years follow-up; This test by an independent coronary angiography core
           laboratories, data management and statistical center, clinical end points to judge
           committee and clinical monitoring of all relevant clinical and imaging data collecting,
           sorting, statistical analysis and judgement.All the selected patients within five years
           continuous follow-up tracking (phone or outpatient follow-up), to observe the happening
           of adverse events to the forward of the second generation of EXCEL drug-eluting stents
           (des) system security to make more accurate and credible evaluation.

      According to the CREATE (Multi - Center Registry of Excel Biodegradable Polymer Drug Eluting
      Stent) registration results show that ExcelTM drug-eluting stents implanted an average of 12
      months, target lesion (TLF) the failure rate of 6.7%.Will this study expected target lesion
      group stent failure rate estimate of 6.7%, the target is 9.5%;Test hypothesis: bilateral
      0.05% 0.05%, master degree, clinical follow-up requirements is more than 95%, this research
      need at least 829 patients, remove the CREDIT II randomized controlled study can provide the
      number of cases of test group 208 examples, this study still need to be included in the 621
      patients.
