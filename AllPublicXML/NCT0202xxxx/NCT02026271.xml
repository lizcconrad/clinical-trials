  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single tumor
      injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex.

      Eligible patients will be stratified to one of two groups, according to clinical indication
      for tumor resection. Patients who are scheduled for a standard of care craniotomy and tumor
      resection will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12
      will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14
      days.

      Patients not scheduled for tumor resection will receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 by stereotactic
      injection and then will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
