  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smartphone applications (apps) may be well-suited as a low cost adjunctive tool for
      increasing the adherence of individuals to psychotherapy treatments which may subsequently
      increase symptom reduction and improve clinical outcomes. Apps offer the opportunity for
      real-time tracking of behavior and have the ability to provide prompt feedback and reminders
      in a convenient, readily available technology. The immediacy and convenience of apps may be
      responsible for the observed improvements in adherence on the part of the patients relative
      to traditional paper-and-pencil tracking and practice of skills taught in psychotherapy.
      These features are relevant to behavioral activation (BA) protocols, the effects of which are
      often attenuated by failure to adhere to regular practice and tracking of behavior. The Mood
      Coach app is a BA protocol developed to provide a convenient means of planning and tracking
      activity, and monitoring mood responses to scheduled increases in activity. This project
      evaluates the utility of this app as an adjunct to standard BA treatment. The investigators
      predict that participants assigned to the BA+app condition will demonstrate greater adherence
      to the BA treatment compared to the standard BA condition. The investigators also predict
      that the participants in the BA+app condition will report greater satisfaction with the app
      compared to the standard BA protocol that utilizes paper and pencil materials.
