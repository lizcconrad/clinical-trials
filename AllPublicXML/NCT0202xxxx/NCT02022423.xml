  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the American population, the numbers of adults with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) will increase significantly over the next several decades. Patients with PAD
      are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality including both cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality. While regular physical activity reduces risk for vascular events and is
      recommended for treatment of PAD patients, few patients meet recommended goals. Exercise
      programs which increase long-term adherence to walking can be an important contribution to
      PAD treatment. Our Internet-based intervention, with an online community builds on a walking
      enhancement program developed by members of our team and is shown to improve adherence among
      patients with vascular disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Using a randomized,
      controlled trial study design, we propose to test an automated Internet-based walking program
      with a social media component, to improve long-term adherence to walking while increasing
      walking distance, and health-related quality of life, among patients with PAD. Participants
      will be randomized to 1 of four study groups: 1) weekly telephone counseling, 2) an
      Internet-based walking program, 3) a combination of telephone counseling and Internet-based
      walking program, or 4) a usual care group. The Internet-based walking program with a social
      media component has been shown to increase both adherence to walking and overall walking
      duration in populations with chronic complex conditions such as CAD and diabetes. There is a
      strong need to develop interventions, easily generalizable to a real-world population, to
      improve the reach of lifestyle interventions which result in improved physical function and
      adherence to regular exercise among complex medical patients. High risk patients such as
      those with PAD (a CAD risk equivalent) stand to benefit the most from such programs.
