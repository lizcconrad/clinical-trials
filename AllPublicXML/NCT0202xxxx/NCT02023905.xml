  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, everolimus (RAD001,
      also known as Afinitor®) alone or with temozolomide has on the patient and the patient's
      low-grade glioma. Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its
      potential to prevent tumor cells from growing and multiplying. Specifically, there is a
      protein called mTOR that we think helps many tumors to grow, and everolimus blocks the effect
      of mTOR. Temozolomide is also an anticancer agent that prevents tumor cells from growing and
      multiplying. About 159 people total will take part in this study. Patients will be assigned
      to one of three treatment groups depending on the results of some tests done on their tumor.
      Each group will have 53 patients in it. 2 groups will receive treatment with everolimus
      alone, while the third group will receive treatment with both everolimus and temozolomide. In
      this study, patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on two characteristics
      of their tumor, called &quot;1p/19q&quot; (this is a test of the tumor chromosomes) and &quot;p-PRAS40&quot;
      (this is a test of a pathway in the tumor called mTOR). If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q
      intact and p-PRAS40 positive, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 1, and the
      patient will receive everolimus alone. If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q intact and p-PRAS40
      negative, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 2 and the patient will receive
      everolimus and temozolomide. If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q co-deleted, regardless of the
      p-PRAS40 result, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 3, and the patient will
      receive everolimus alone.

    <description>If the tumor is 1p/19q intact, then patients will be further selected by whether or not their tumor demonstrates activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. If activation is present, patients will be treated in Arm 1 with single-agent everolimus at 10 mg daily continuously. In all arms, treatment with everolimus will continue for up to 24 cycles, after which patients will be followed with interval MRIs until progression.</description>

    <description>If the tumor is 1p/19q intact, then patients will be further selected by whether or not their tumor demonstrates activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. If activation is not present, patients will be treated in Arm 2 with combined everolimus and Temozolomide. Everolimus will be given at 10 mg daily continuously, and Temozolomide will be dosed initially at 150 mg/m2/day for 5 days out of a 28-day cycle. In all arms, treatment with everolimus will continue for up to 24 cycles, after which patients will be followed with interval MRIs until progression. In Arm 2, TMZ will be stopped after 12 cycles.</description>
