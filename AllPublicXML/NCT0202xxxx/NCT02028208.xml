  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare ascending doses of investigational T.R.U.E. Test
      allergens to the marketed petrolatum reference allergen.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized study to compare the diagnostic performance
      (primary) and safety (secondary) of ascending doses of mercury, aluminum and palladium in 20
      adult subjects who have a clinical history of contact dermatitis and have tested positive
      (current or previous patch test) to at least one of the allergens being tested.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who exhibit Positive Responses to each Allergen Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>3-21 days following application</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be patch tested with one experimental T.R.U.E. Test allergen panel containing ascending doses of either mercury, aluminum or palladium and a negative control and a second panel containing the marketed reference allergen. The panels will be worn for approximately 48 hours. Skin reactions will be assessed at 3, 4 and 21 days following application. A response is considered positive if it is graded 1+ (erythema, infiltration, discrete papules), 2+ (erythema, papules, infiltration, discrete vesicles) or 3+ (coalescing vesicles, bullous eruption) during at least one post removal visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who exhibit Irritation (tape reaction), Itching and/or Burning Resulting from Application of the Investigational and Reference Allergen Panels</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2: 48 hours after application</time_frame>
    <description>Tape irritation is graded on a 4 point scale: None (no tape irritation), Weak (faint to definite pink), Moderate (moderate erythema, definite redness) and Strong (severe erythema, very intense redness). Percentage of response will include weak, moderate and strong reactions.
Itching and Burning are graded on a 4 point scale: None (no discomfort), Weak (minimal discomfort), Moderate (definite discomfort) and Strong (significantly bothersome, possible interference with sleep or daily activity). Percentage of response will include weak, moderate and strong responses.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.15 years of age or older.

        2. History of contact dermatitis.

        3. Positive patch results to 1) mercury (elemental), 2) aluminum (aluminum chloride
        hexahydrate, aluminum hydroxide and/or aluminum lactate) or 3) palladium (sodium
        tetrachloropalladate and/or palladium chloride) within the past 10 years.

        4. Male or non-pregnant non-lactating female. Female subjects must state, at visit one that
        they are not pregnant, not lactating nor are they intending to become pregnant for the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Breastfeeding or pregnant or intending to become pregnant for the course of the study.

          2. Topical treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents on or near
             the test area during the 7 days prior to inclusion in this study.

          3. Systemic treatment with corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg prednisone) or other
             immunosuppressive agents during the 7 days prior to inclusion in this study. Inhaled
             treatments are permitted.

          4. Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the 3 weeks prior to

          5. Acute dermatitis outbreak or dermatitis on or near the test area on the back.

          6. Inability to comply with patch test study requirements including multiple return
             visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess moisture
             due to showering or vigorous activity).

          7. Participation in a clinical trial of an investigational drug, treatment or device
             other than T.R.U.E. TEST during this study or 3 weeks prior to inclusion in this
             study.

          8. An opinion of the Investigator that deems the potential subject to be non-compliant,
             unable to return for study visits or complete the study as detailed in the protocol.
