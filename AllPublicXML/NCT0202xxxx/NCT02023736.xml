      This study is a comparison of client outcomes in two different types of psychotherapy
      treatment. In one condition clients will receive treatment-as-usual (TAU); the therapy that
      they would normally receive. In the other condition clients will receive treatment-as-usual
      but in addition their therapist will have access to empirical feedback on client progress.
      Clients in the feedback condition will fill out weekly online questionnaires, and their
      therapists will have access to a website that feeds back the results of these questionnaires.
      The purpose of the study is to understand the impact of providing such feedback to
      therapists. Participating therapists at 4 sites will offer all of their clients the
      opportunity to participate, and participating clients will be randomly assigned to either
      condition. This should result in a representative sample of client seeking treatment at these
      4 Chicago-area clinics.
