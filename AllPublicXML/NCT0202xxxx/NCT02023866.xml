    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cysteamine bitartrate delayed-release capsules
      (RP103) for treatment of children with inherited mitochondrial disease.

      Prior to treatment, patients will undergo a Screening Visit. If eligible, each participant
      will return for the Day 1 study visit and begin dosing. Every 2 weeks over the subsequent 8
      weeks, participants will alternate between returning to the clinic for detailed assessments
      (Weeks 4 and 8) and receiving a telephone call from the Investigator team to assess safety
      and RP103 dose (Weeks 2 and 6) and the potential need for an immediate unscheduled study
      visit. Thereafter, participants will continue to return to the clinic every 4 weeks for
      detailed assessments at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (the Study Exit visit).

      The Study Exit visit will occur at Week 24, and participants will be offered the opportunity
      to continue on to an extension study (RP103-MITO-002 [NCT02473445]) until results of the
      present study are known.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) Sections I-IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The NPMDS evaluates the progression of mitochondrial disease in pediatric patients in 4 domains:
I - Current Function (vision, hearing, communication, feeding, and mobility) with scores ranging from 0 to 21; II -System Specific Involvement (seizures, encephalopathy, bleeding diathesis or coagulation defects, gastrointestinal, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, liver, and blood) with scores ranging from 0 to 30.
III - Current Clinical Assessment (growth and development over past 6 months, vision, strabismus and eye movement, myopathy, ataxia, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and neuropathy) with scores ranging from 0 to 28; and IV - Quality of Life with scores ranging from 0 to 25. For sections I-III, higher scores reflect more severe disease. For Section IV, a higher score reflects a lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Dystonia symptoms were assessed using the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale for Dystonia. Participants were assessed for dystonia in each of the following regions: eyes, mouth, neck, trunk, and each upper and lower extremity (8 body regions) on a scale from 0 (absent) to 4 (severe symptoms). The individual scores were summed to calculate the total score which ranges from 0 (dystonia absent) to 32 (severe dystonia).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Ataxia was assessed using the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS). FARS comprises a functional ataxia staging score of overall mobility (score 0 to 6), an assessment of the activities of daily living (ADL) (score 0 to 36) and a neurological assessment (score from 0 to 117) which is composed of bulbar (score 0-11), upper limb (score 0- 36) and lower limb (score 0-16), peripheral nerve (score 0-26) and upright stability/gait (score 0-28). The scores were summed to calculate the total score which ranges from 0 to 159. A higher score indicates a greater level of disability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gross Motor Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Retarded motor development was assessed using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)-88 which consists of 88 items scored on a scale of 0 to 3:
0: Does not initiate the task;
Initiates the task (completes &lt; 10%);
Partially completes the task (10 to 99%);
Completes the task (100%).
The 88 items are grouped into five dimensions: 1) lying and rolling, 2) sitting, 3) crawling and kneeling, 4) standing, and 5) walking, running and jumping. Scores are expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. The total score is the average of the 5 the percentage scores where higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

        <description>The NPMDS evaluates the progression of mitochondrial disease in pediatric patients in 4 domains:
I - Current Function (vision, hearing, communication, feeding, and mobility) with scores ranging from 0 to 21; II -System Specific Involvement (seizures, encephalopathy, bleeding diathesis or coagulation defects, gastrointestinal, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, liver, and blood) with scores ranging from 0 to 30.
III - Current Clinical Assessment (growth and development over past 6 months, vision, strabismus and eye movement, myopathy, ataxia, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and neuropathy) with scores ranging from 0 to 28; and IV - Quality of Life with scores ranging from 0 to 25. For sections I-III, higher scores reflect more severe disease. For Section IV, a higher score reflects a lower quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Dystonia symptoms were assessed using the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale for Dystonia. Participants were assessed for dystonia in each of the following regions: eyes, mouth, neck, trunk, and each upper and lower extremity (8 body regions) on a scale from 0 (absent) to 4 (severe symptoms). The individual scores were summed to calculate the total score which ranges from 0 (dystonia absent) to 32 (severe dystonia).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale</title>
        <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Ataxia was assessed using the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS). FARS comprises a functional ataxia staging score of overall mobility (score 0 to 6), an assessment of the activities of daily living (ADL) (score 0 to 36) and a neurological assessment (score from 0 to 117) which is composed of bulbar (score 0-11), upper limb (score 0- 36) and lower limb (score 0-16), peripheral nerve (score 0-26) and upright stability/gait (score 0-28). The scores were summed to calculate the total score which ranges from 0 to 159. A higher score indicates a greater level of disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gross Motor Function</title>
        <description>The investigator selected the two most preeminent symptoms for each participant during the screening visit from the following: myopathy, dystonia, ataxia, retarded motor development, reduced activities of daily living, and vision. The 2 symptoms selected for each participant were then assessed at each subsequent study visit.
Retarded motor development was assessed using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)-88 which consists of 88 items scored on a scale of 0 to 3:
0: Does not initiate the task;
Initiates the task (completes &lt; 10%);
Partially completes the task (10 to 99%);
Completes the task (100%).
The 88 items are grouped into five dimensions: 1) lying and rolling, 2) sitting, 3) crawling and kneeling, 4) standing, and 5) walking, running and jumping. Scores are expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. The total score is the average of the 5 the percentage scores where higher scores indicate better performance.</description>
