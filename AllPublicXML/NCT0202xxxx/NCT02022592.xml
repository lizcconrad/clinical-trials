  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A goal directed , demand-driven administration of sedative drugs is an integral part of every
      intensive care treatment. During long-term application of sedatives, Midazolam is the most
      commonly used sedative in Europe.

      One major objective is the problem of oversedation and agitation during an intensive care
      treatment due to the lack of controllability of available substances.

      The Love-Mi RCT investigates the clinical controllability of Midazolam versus the newly
      available intravenous drug Lormetazepam.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midazolam is almost exclusively metabolized intrahepatically. The methyl-group at position 1
      of the imidazole ring is oxidized by liver enzymes. The product is a-OH-midazolam. This
      reaction is catalyzed by a p450-dependent oxidase in the liver.

      Active a-OH-midazolam is inactivated by a biotransformation type II reaction after
      conjugation. The water soluble, conjugated midazolam can be excreted by the kidney.

      During an intensive care treatment, the p450 dependent metabolization is known to be a
      &quot;bottleneck of elimination&quot; as many drugs are inactivated by this pathway.

      As the phase II (glucuronidation) is non-saturable in practice - the phase I reaction limits
      the metabolic capacity. This leads to unpredictable prolongation of midazolam effects.

      In contrast, Lormetazepam is glucuronized directly at its OH-group during a phase II
      reaction. Since the glucuronidation is non-saturable, Lormetazepam is metabolized with nearly
      constant kinetics even if repeatedly administered.

      Due to the pharmacokinetics we hypothesize that Lormetazepam has an improved controllability
      compared to midazolam. As this leads to less frequent agitation and over-sedation, we
      hypothesize that there are multiple beneficial clinical outcomes for patients treated with
      lormetazepam instead of midazolam.
