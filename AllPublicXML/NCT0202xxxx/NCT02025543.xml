      This multi-center, multi-vendor study will validate a rapid magnetic resonance-based
      confounder-corrected R2* mapping method as a quantitative imaging biomarker of liver iron
      concentration (LIC). Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver,
      which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at
      reducing body iron stores. Measurement of LIC is critical for detection and staging of iron
      overload, and for monitoring iron-reducing chelator therapies that are expensive and have
      side effects. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely available, accessible, and safe
      technology, and it is very sensitive to the presence of iron in tissue. Translation of an MRI
      biomarker of liver iron concentration into broad clinical use requires that it is clinically
      feasible, precise, robust to changes in scan parameters, calibrated to a validated reference
      standard of LIC, and is reproducible across sites and manufacturers. There are currently no
      available MRI methods that meet these requirements. R2*-MRI holds the greatest promise to
      meet these requirements. R2* mapping can be performed very rapidly with whole-liver 3D
      coverage in a single 20s breath-hold.

    <description>We expect to demonstrate equivalence between R2 measured with different protocols with higher repeatability than standard MRI iron imaging measurement and with linear calibration to liver iron concentration . This project will be considered a success if we establish the reproducibility of confounder-corrected R2 MRI: we expect the calibrations at all sites to be equivalent.</description>
