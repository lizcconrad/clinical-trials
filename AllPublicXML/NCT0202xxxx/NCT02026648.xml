  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix has showed a marked decline in developed
      countries over the past 40 years, however, there has also been an increase in relative and
      absolute incidence of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma (AC) of the uterine cervix
      over the same period.

      Our understanding of the natural history and optimal management of AC is limited. It appears
      that AC and SCC of the cervix behave differently. They are different in epidemiology,
      prognostic factors, and patterns of failure after similar treatments. Available data suggest
      that they may also differ in their response to treatment. We postulate that new treatment
      strategies specifically tailored to AC should be explored.

      However, there is few data about outcome of cervical cancer in Taiwan. So we propose this
      proposal for retrospective analysis of clinicopathological parameters and outcomes in
      patients of cervical cancer, especially for cervical adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous
      carcinoma.

             at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.

          -  All the patients diagnosed as cervical cancer, especially for women with adeno- and
             adenosquamous carcinoma.

          -  To review:

               1. Clinical data: including age at diagnosis, presenting symptoms, gravidity,
                  parity, menstrual history, body mass index, history of diabetes, hypertension,
