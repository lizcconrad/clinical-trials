      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that
      cannot be removed by surgery or with cancer of the cervix, endometrium, ovary, fallopian tube
      or peritoneal cavity. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and
      bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-malignant melanoma [MM]) of Abraxane
      (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation)/bevacizumab-complex (AB-complex)
      among patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-gynecologic [GYN]) of AB-complex among
      patients with gynecologic cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of
      AB-complex among patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      II. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of
      AB-complex among patients with gynecologic cancers.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered in the context of AB-complex. II. Tumor
      concentrations of paclitaxel 24 hour (h) following AB-complex infusion and correlation with
      plasma levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation/bevacizumab-complex
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 12 months.
