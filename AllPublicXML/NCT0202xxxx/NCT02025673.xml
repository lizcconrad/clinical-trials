    <textblock>
      Betatrophin is a newly identified hormone that promotes pancreatic beta cell proliferation,
      improves glucose tolerance and regulates lipids metabolism. A recent study showed that
      circulating concentrations of betatrophin doubled in type 1 diabetes. The objective of this
      study is to investigate the association of serum betatrophin levels with the progression of
      diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and the level of betatrophin in
      gestational diabetes patients and pregnant women.

      200 subjects were recruited in this study and divided into six groups for comparison of the
      serum betatrophin. 70 healthy subjects and 20 healthy young volunteers were enrolled for
      investigating the role of betatrophin in energy homeostasis and the circadian rhythm. 50
      patients with type 2 diabetes were classified into three groups by the stage of diabetic
      retinopathy. Rank test was used to analyze the correlation between the progression of
      diabetic retinopathy and circulating betatrophin. Betatrophin were measured by a commercially
      available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed via Western Blot.

        19 healthy pregnant women and 9 pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
        were enrolled in the study. 24 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus
        before treatment, 35 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after treatment. Subjects were
        recruited from patients at the Department of Clinical Endocrinology and Maternity
        Department, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.
