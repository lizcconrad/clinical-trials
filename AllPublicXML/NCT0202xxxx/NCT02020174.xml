      The purpose of The Preeclampsia Registry is to collect and store medical and other
      information from women who have been medically diagnosed with preeclampsia or a related
      hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorder of pregnancy such as eclampsia or HELLP syndrome,
      their family members, and women who have not had preeclampsia to serve as controls.
      Information from participants will be used for medical research to try to understand why
      preeclampsia occurs, how to predict it better, and to develop experimental clinical trials of
      new treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy, diagnosed by the development of
      high blood pressure and protein in the urine in the latter half of pregnancy. Preeclampsia
      affects approximately 5 percent of pregnancies, up to 300,000 pregnant women in the U.S.
      annually. Approximately 75,000 of these women suffer severe maternal outcomes: organ failure,
      massive blood loss, permanent disability or death; and severe fetal outcomes: prematurity,
      abnormal fetal growth, and long-term disability or death of their babies.

      Despite years of research along multiple investigational lines, the cause and mechanisms
      underlying preeclampsia remain unclear. At this point in time, the only &quot;cure&quot; for
      preeclampsia remains delivery of the placenta. Given the onset of preeclampsia at sometimes
      very preterm gestational ages, delivery can be associated with substantial risks of
      prematurity. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia can put
      pregnancies at significant risk. An improved understanding of this condition is essential for
      the development of novel screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for mothers and
      their babies.

      To further our scientific understanding of preeclampsia, large, longitudinal studies of women
      and their families are needed. The Preeclampsia Registry will provide a large-scale data
      registry and sample repository resource with unique attributes to address these important
      questions, including long-term longitudinal follow up of participants and engagement of
      families.

      Specific Procedures

      Participants will log on to The Preeclampsia Registry website to enter their name, address,
      phone number, and email. An email will be sent to participants containing a unique login ID,
      which is the participant's email address, and a password. Participants will return to the
      registry website to login and will be asked to change their password. Participants will
      review the informed consent documents, and provide informed consent. Participants will have
      the opportunity to contact the Research Coordinator with questions regarding the consent
      and/or registry.

      Once informed consent is obtained, participants will complete the registry questionnaire on
      The Preeclampsia Registry website (www.preeclampsiaregistry.org). The participants will have
      the ability to return to the website to complete or update information as often as necessary.
      Participants will have the option of scanning and uploading their own medical records to The
      Preeclampsia Registry website using their unique login and password. The registry will also
      ask participants to complete and sign a medical records release form to provide permission
      for a member of the registry staff to request the participant's medical records from the
      doctor and/or hospital where they were treated. The registry will send out notifications by
      email periodically to remind participants to return to the registry website to update their
      information and their children's information, make changes to their medical history, and add
      new pregnancies if applicable.

      Saliva samples for DNA extraction are being collected on some participants. All participants
      will be asked to provide their permission to be contacted in the future about donating a
      sample of blood, tissue, or other biospecimen for future research. Participants will not be
      required to submit biological specimens in order to participate in the Registry and will need
      to sign a separate consent to donate a sample.

      Self reported data collected from participants includes Personal History, Maternal Outcomes,
      Brief Reproductive History, Medical History, Family Medical History, Biological Father
      Information, Demographic Information, Prenatal Care, Medications/Drug use During Pregnancy,
      Metabolic Questions, Pregnancy Symptoms, Hypertension, Delivery and Baby Information, and
      Postpartum data.

      Medical records will be used primarily to confirm a diagnosis of PE or other hypertensive
      disorder of pregnancy; however, they will also be used to validate any self-reported data as
      available.

      Participant medical information will be stored electronically within the Registry. The names
      of the Registry participants will be deleted from their stored medical information and
      replaced with a linkage code, making the record de-identified. Access to participant medical
      information contained within the Registry will be restricted to the Principal Investigator
      and her designees.

      Participants will be asked to provide their permission to share their de-identified (coded)
      information with other registries and databases. This information may be used for
      retrospective research or to plan for clinical trials. Participants will be asked to allow
      the Foundation investigators to review this information to determine if the participants may
      be eligible for participation in future research studies being conducted by secondary
      investigators (not affiliated with the Foundation). Interested Registry participants
      contacted for possible participation in future research studies being conducted by secondary
      investigators will undergo a separate informed consent process for each such research study.

      The Registry's Steering Committee will conduct a formal review of proposals of
      investigator-driven research projects and will provide recommendations to the PI. The PI,
      under the Registry's current protocol, must grant final approval for all studies conducted
      using medical information contained within the Registry. Such approvals shall be obtained
      prior to providing investigator information from the Registry; shall be based upon
      considerations of scientific quality and validity; shall be granted only for research studies
      related to PE or related hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and shall be documented. Prior
      to provision of data to any investigator, the information shall be de-identified. The
      Registry shall require investigators to obtain IRB approval prior to its provision of
      de-identified information to the investigator.

      Approved scientists, researchers, and clinicians, will be given only the de-identified
      information and may search the de-identified data for patients for their studies. If an
      affected individual looks like a good match for a specific study, the researcher will contact
      the Registry. A Registry staff member will then contact the participant or the participant's
      family. Researchers will not directly contact participants or their families as they will
      only see de-identified data. It will be the choice of the Registry participant or their
      family to decide to initiate direct contact with the interested researcher.

      Data Management and Statistical Analysis

      The information collected through this registry is maintained by MedSciNet, a company based
      in Sweden that specializes in the development of online database systems for registries,
      clinical trials, and medical bio banks. The data and safety monitoring plan for the registry
      will involve routine monitoring by the Principal Investigator or her designees of 1) removal
      of direct identifiers from information contained within the registry; 2) the documentation of
      provision of de-identified registry information to investigators; 3) the security of the
      database linking the registry linkage codes with participant identifiers and the
      documentation of access to this database for the purpose of gathering data for investigators;
      and 4) any conditions that may negatively impact the confidentiality of information contained
      within the registry.

      High data quality is achieved using standard data entry fields (numeric, date, time,
      dropdown, radio, checkbox fields, open text, etc.) as well as applying standard validation
      rules (mandatory, ranges for dates/numeric fields, data type, etc.) Predefined code lists are
      used to ensure that only standardized values are chosen. Clinical data is entered via forms
      comprised mainly of checkboxes, drop down menus and specified value fields. A few open text
      box fields capture natural history and individual participant experiences. Built-in data
      checks prevent most errors during data entry, further contributing to the ease of use for a
      non-technical user.

      All history of changes of individual data values is kept in the database. The information
      that is kept about each change of the data value includes user performing the change, date
      and time of change, old and new value. Reviewing of audit trail is available at individual
      data point level or at the form level.

      For the collection of outcomes data, standard, well-validated outcomes instruments have been
      used such as the data harmonization criteria established by Co-Lab, the reVITALize data
      definitions validated by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the
      common data points suggested by the Women's Health Registries Alliance. Using these
      instruments helps ensure that all basic data captured by the Registry will be compatible and
      interoperable across all registries and biobanks that may share research data. Beyond those
      instruments, the remaining questions have been formulated based on the input of the
      Registry's volunteer Scientific Advisory Council with input from patients and a review of the
      Foundation's Community Forum and social media networks where patients' research questions are
      typically expressed. These validation efforts, already voluntarily undertaken, demonstrate
      the Foundation's intention to maximize the use of its Registry and its willingness and
      commitment to participate in networks that will amplify the Registry's research potential.

      Recruitment Procedures

      Recruitment will involve an IRB approved email that will be sent to Preeclampsia Foundation
      volunteers and mailing list subscribers. Advertisements will be placed online (social media
      sites and webpages) and newspapers or other media sources after IRB approval. Other IRB
      approved forms of advertisement will include printed materials such as brochures, posters,
      pass along cards, and flyers placed in physician offices, public health clinics, and
      community health education events.

      Safety Considerations

      There are no risks of physical harm associated with participation in The Preeclampsia
      Registry. As the registry includes questions that can be sensitive and uncomfortable for an
      individual to answer, participants will be encouraged to skip questions they do not wish to
      answer.

      Benefits

      There are no direct benefits associated with participation in The Preeclampsia Registry. The
      use of information contained within The Preeclampsia Registry for retrospective research
      analysis may be of benefit to future patients with preeclampsia or related hypertensive
      disorders of pregnancy. Participants in the registry will be informed of future research
      studies involving preeclampsia and related hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, for which a
      separate informed consent will be obtained, and may offer direct benefit to The Preeclampsia
      Registry participants.

      Cost and Payments

      All costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of the registry shall be
      supported by the Preeclampsia Foundation. Participants will not be compensated for their time
      and participation in this registry.

      Withdrawal From Study

      Participation in all aspects of this study is voluntary. The consent form states this
      clearly. Should a participant change his/her mind and wish to withdraw participant
      information from the registry, the individual may do so by writing a letter or email to The
      Preeclampsia Foundation to notify them he/she no longer wants to participate. No explanation
      will be required. If withdrawal is requested, the participant's information will be removed
      from the registry. However, information accessed prior to the request for removal cannot be
      retrieved from researchers that have already accessed it.
