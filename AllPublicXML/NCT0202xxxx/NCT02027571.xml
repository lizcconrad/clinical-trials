      The reasons for the epidemics of diabetes and prediabetes, and why individuals from certain
      populations suffer at higher rates are not well known. In the Pathobiology and Reversibility
      of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (PROP-ABC) study, nearly 400 African Americans and
      Caucasians whose parents have type 2 diabetes will undergo repeated testing to determine what
      factors lead to the occurrence of prediabetes, and whether race still plays a major role in a
      setting where everyone being studied has one or both parents with diabetes. The PROP-ABC
      Study also will test the hypothesis that the ability of intensive lifestyle intervention to
      reverse prediabetes and return people's metabolism back to normal is dependent on how long
      people have had prediabetes.

      The Pathobiology and Reversibility of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (PROP-ABC) study is
      following an extant cohort of 376 initially normoglycemic African American and Caucasian
      offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes for an additional 5years. The subjects were
      enrolled between 2006 and 2009 and have been followed up to 2012, during which 10 have
      developed diabetes and 101 developed prediabetes, without evidence of racial disparities.

      The objectives of PROP-ABC are to gain a fuller understanding of the natural history and
      predictors of early glucose abnormalities, determine the role of race during the second wave
      of glycemic progression, and to access the time dependency of reversibility of prediabetes.
      The study tests 4 hypotheses: 1) Among offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes, early
      progression from normal to impaired glucose regulation (within 5 yr) occurs in the
      highest-risk subjects independently of race, whereas late progression (5-10 yr) displays
      racial disparities, and is predicted by physiological, biochemical and behavioral markers; 2)
      Early microvascular complications, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and endothelial
      dysfunction manifest during transition from normal to impaired glucose regulation, display
      racial disparities, and are predicted by glycemic and nonglycemic factors; 3) The
      &quot;metabolically healthy&quot; insulin-sensitive obese (ISO) phenotype displays racial disparities
      in its association with cardiometabolic risk factors and incident dysglycemia among
      African-Americans and Caucasians offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes; and 4) Duration
      of the prediabetic state is a major determinant of, and is inversely related to, the efficacy
      of lifestyle intervention to induce regression of the prediabetic phenotype and restoration
      of normal glucose regulation. Participants with prediabetes and others who develop
      prediabetes during PROP-ABC will receive Intensive Lifestyle intervention (ILI).

      We define duration of prediabetes as the interval from date of confirmed prediabetes to the
      date of initiation of ILI, stratified to 3 prediabetes intervals: a) &lt;1 yr, b) 1 to &lt;3 yr, c)
      3-6 yr. The primary outcome measure is restoration of normal glucose regulation (fasting
      plasma glucose &lt;100 mg/dl and 2-hour post-load plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dl). Secondary
      endpoints include normalization of either fasting plasma glucose or 2-hour post-load plasma
      glucose , occurrence of diabetes, insulin sensitivity and secretion. Data will be analyzed
      according to the &quot;intention to treat&quot; principle. Based on power calculations, a sample size
      of 150 subjects (50/prediabetes interval) would allow detection of medium to large effect off
      ILI with ~85% power. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be generated for the 3 prediabetes
      intervals, and log-rank test will be used to analyze the time to occurrence of primary
      outcome. The prospective PROP-ABC, designed to identify new cases of prediabetes as they
      occur, is uniquely placed to test the time dependency of reversibility of incident
      prediabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  As planned these studies will enroll interested persons from among the group of 376
             subjects who participated in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort
             (POP-ABC) study between 2006 and 2012. That group includes 267 women and 109 men; 217
             are African Americans and 159 are Caucasians. At the time of initial enrollment into
             POP-ABC, these participants were selected for being nondiabetic offspring of parents
             with type 2 diabetes. Race and ethnicity was by self-report of non-Hispanic white or
             non-Hispanic black heritage, and their age range was 18-65 years at enrollment. No new
             subjects will be recruited into this established cohort. To be eligible for inclusion
             in the renewal study, subjects must be ambulatory, be in good general health, and must
             not be taking medications known to alter insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or
             body weight.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria: Persons not enrolled in POP-ABC study; diagnosis of diabetes or
             use of any antidiabetic medication; medical conditions that preclude participation in
             physical activity; history of liposuction, surgical weight reduction; use of
             glucocorticoids, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics (&gt; 25 mg/day), or medication known
             to alter glucose metabolism. Women who are pregnant or become pregnant while
             participating in this study will have all testing procedures delayed until 12 months
             after delivery.
