      The objective is to obtain plasma samples from Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1)
      infected individuals that have viral loads across the dynamic range of the Aptima HIV-1
      assay. The plasma samples will be tested in a method comparison study to support the approval
      of the Aptima HIV-1 assay on Gen-Probe's Panther testing system. The objective of the method
      comparison study is to evaluate the clinical utility of the Aptima HIV-1 assay by comparing
      the results to the FDA-licensed COBAS assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, New
      Jersey) in plasma samples that have viral loads across the dynamic range of the Aptima HIV-1
      assay.

        HIV-infected male and female subjects â‰¥15 years of age who are attending participating US
        medical facilities will be eligible to enroll. Participating sites may include academic
        institutions with clinical divisions, infectious disease clinics, and other medical
        facilities such as sexually transmitted infection, HIV, and public health facilities

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  The subject has documented HIV infection

          -  The subject is at least 15 years of age at the time of enrollment

          -  For ART subjects, subject has documented HIV-1 RNA levels above the lower limit of
             quantitation of an FDA-approved assay in a sample collected in the past 90 days.

          -  The subject (and/or legally authorized representative, if allowed) is willing and able
             to provide written informed consent before providing a specimen (a minor will need the
             documented consent of his/her parent or legal guardian, unless the site has an
             institutional review board [IRB]-approved waiver for parental consent for minors).

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  A potential subject will be ineligible for the study if the subject, clinician, or
             medical record reports any of the following:

          -  Subject's HIV disease stage and/or current ART status is unknown.

          -  It is unknown if current or previous ART was changed or stopped due to therapy
             failure.

          -  For non-ART subjects, subject was previously on ART in the past 30 days

          -  Subject already participated in this study and subject's previous sample(s) was
             provided and not withdrawn (ie, subject has an evaluable sample in the study)

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the principal investigator (PI) or designee
             considers could interfere with or affect the conduct, results, and/or completion of
             the study

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the PI or designee considers could create an
             unacceptable risk to the subject if enrolled in the study
