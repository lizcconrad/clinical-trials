    <textblock>
      Low blood sugars are known to cause brain damage in newborn babies. One of the most common
      causes of low blood sugars persisting beyond the new born period is a condition called
      congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). This is a disease whereby the pancreas secretes too much
      insulin and causes low blood sugars. Twenty to forty percent of these babies will have brain
      damage. There are two forms of this disease. In one form only a small part of the pancreas
      makes too much insulin (focal HI) and in the other, the whole pancreas make too much insulin
      (diffuse HI). If a surgeon could know which part of the pancreas has the focal lesion he
      could remove it and cure the patient.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a new investigational drug called
      Fluorodopa F 18, when used with a PET scan, can find the focal lesion and guide the surgeon
      to remove it, thus curing the patient and preventing further brain damage

    <textblock>
      Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI) is a disorder of insulin secretion that causes profound
      hypoglycemia leading to significant morbidity. It is the most common form of persistent
      neonatal hypoglycemia, and the most dangerous. Inappropriate insulin secretion causes not
      only hypoglycemia but also inability to release free fatty acids from adipose tissue and
      inability to release glycogen from the liver. Hence the brain is deprived of all the major
      fuel sources (glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) for energy thus leading to the high
      incidence of brain damage. In up to 50% of cases of congenital hyperinsulinism, medical
      therapy fails and surgical resection of the pancreas is necessary. Previous techniques
      developed to differentiate those patients with focal HI in whom surgery could result in a
      cure are very invasive and put the infants at risk for hypoglycemic brain damage or arterial
      thrombosis.

      It is known that the beta cells in the pancreatic islets, similar to other neuroendocrine
      tissues, contain amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Beta cells take up L-Dopa and convert it
      into dopamine by AADC. It was proposed that as other neuroendocrine tumors such as
      phaeochromocytoma and carcinoid tumors express AADC and can be very easily visualized using
      Fluorodopa F 18 PET then so also would the pancreas be easily and accurately visualized.
      After initial reports demonstrated the effectiveness, safety and accuracy, there have been
      now over 200 patients with HI reported in the literature who have had Fluorodopa F 18 PET
      scans with suggestions that referral to major HI centers for Fluorodopa F 18 PET CT is now an
      integral part of standard of care management of patients with HI that require surgery.
      Fluorodopa F 18 PET scanning for patients with Hyperinsulinism is now established in Europe
      and Australia, and has close to 95% sensitivity. When linked to Computed Tomography (CT)
      image of the pancreas, Fluorodopa F 18 PET allows the surgeon to image the pancreas in three
      dimensions, to even more accurately identify the site of the focal lesion, increasing the
      chance of a sufficient partial pancreatectomy to cure the patient.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine, using Positron Emission Tomography, the qualitative uptake of a
           radiopharmaceutical agent, Fluorodopa F 18, produced at a distance far from the imaging
           center, in the pancreas of patients with congenital hyperinsulinism.

        2. To determine whether, using a method of Computed Tomography Scanning combined with
           Fluorodopa F 18 pancreatic imaging will match the surgical histopathological findings of
           focal vs. diffuse islet cell abnormalities in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism
           who receive partial or complete pancreatectomy to treat their disease.

    <description>A dose of Fluorodopa F 18, 3-6 MBq/Kg (0.08-0.16 mCi/kg), will be injected intravenously into the subject under the direct supervision of the radiology sub-investigator. Then, the PET imaging procedure will begin and proceed for up to 70 minutes after injection. An abdominal CT image will be made using intravenous contrast. Both images, PET and CT, will be co-localized by the radiologist for interpretation.</description>

             being treated by an Endocrinologist which may be the PI or a partner of this
             clinician.

          -  The patient's Endocrinologist has determined that the patient cannot be safely managed
             with standard medical therapy (failed) and surgery is recommended to prevent future
             episodes of severe hypoglycemia and preserve brain function. Failure of medical
             therapy is defined as both:

               -  Hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;70 m/dL) on a single measure despite the use of
                  anti-hypoglycemic medications, if applicable to the individual patient, including

             well-controlled blood glucose levels with any degree of dietary or medical management,
             BUT the patient and their parent(s) or LAR wishes to proceed with surgery for a
             possible cure of HI disease.
