  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a novel schedule of an oral
      anticancer drug, capecitabine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      Mathematical models have predicted that 7 days of capecitabine followed by 7 days of rest is
      an optimal dosing schedule for this drug and previous studies done al Memorial Sloan
      Kettering Cancer Center support the tolerability of this scheme.

      This definitive, randomized trial comparing the efficacy of the new dosage with the
      conventional dosing schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer is necessary and we
      hypothesize it will be superior in terms of efficacy.

      Dosing schedules based on mathematical predictions for optimal drug delivery based on
      efficacy rather than toxicity could facilitate more rapid and economical drug development.
      This trial is a proof of principle trial of the highest priority.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is PFS, defined as the time from treatment start to progression or last date of follow-up. PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. This will be an intention to treat analysis. The Log-rank test will be used to test whether PFS is different for the two capecitabine schedules. It is hypothesized that the 7-7 schedule of capecitabine will have superior efficacy.</description>
