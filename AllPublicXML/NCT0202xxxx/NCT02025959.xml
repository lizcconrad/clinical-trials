    <textblock>
      Getting better sleep in the hospital is especially important due to a variety of adverse
      health effects that can potentially worsen patient recovery.

      To address these concerns and improve sleep in US hospitals, we aim to develop the SIESTA
      (Sleep for Inpatients: Empowering Staff to Act) program as an educational intervention
      designed to prepare hospital staff to assist patients in obtaining better sleep in hospitals
      and recognize the importance of screening for sleep disorders. The major educational goals of
      this proposal is to develop and pilot test an online educational program (SIESTA) which aims
      to train and motivate medical professionals to provide better sleep for hospitalized
      patients.

      We will utilize data from an ongoing sleep study, performed by the research team at the
      University of Chicago that looks at how adult patients are able to sleep while they are in
      the hospital, as a means of education for the participating medical staff.
