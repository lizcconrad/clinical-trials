      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that RNAseq will allow us to learn more about the causative agents
      of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) and risk factors involved in acquiring these
      devastating infections

      Tissue biopsies will be obtained from consented patients admitted with NSTI. Biopsies will be
      used for standard clinical analysis of bacterial species present or stored for later RNA
      sequencing. RNA sequencing will identify bacteria that are present within the infection site
      that may not be detected using standard culture techniques as well as reveal bacterial gene
      expression profiles within the NSTI site. Medical charts will also be reviewed for basic
      patient information as well as wound care management practices. We hope to identify bacterial
      species commonly present in these types of infections as well as risk factors predisposing
      individuals to NSTI's.
