  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disseminated leishmaniasis (DL) is an emerging and severe form of leishmaniasis, with
      increasing prevalence in Bahia, Brasil. It is characterized by multiple acneiform, papular
      and ulcerated lesions localized on the face, chest, abdomen and extremities. The number of
      lesions ranges from 10 to hundreds, and mucosal disease has been documented in more than 40%
      of the cases.

      DL is a hard to cure disease and therapeutic failure with pentavalent antimony has been
      documented in up to 70% of the cases caused by L. braziliensis in the endemic area of Corte
      de Pedra, Bahia. The majority of DL patients need several courses of antimony or the use of
      high dose of Amphotericin B desoxicolate to cure. Therefore DL patients are exposed to
      relevant drug toxicity, high morbidity due to a long lasting disease, with an important
      socio-economic impact. Our hypothesis is that liposomal Amphotericin B has a higher cure rate
      than historic cure rates of pentavalent antimony in the treatment of disseminated
      leishmaniasis.

    <description>Liposomal Amphotericin B will be administered by intravenous route, 3 to 5 mg/kg/day, during 7 to 14 days of treatment. Complete hemogram, aminotransferases (AST, ALT), blood urea and creatinine will be determined in all patients on days -1, and three times/week up to the end of therapy. Patients will bemonitored for side effects daily. Patients will be followed-up at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months post-therapy. Clinical and laboratory adverse events will be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) of the National Cancer Institute.</description>
