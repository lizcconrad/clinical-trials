  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because anidulafungin is generally well tolerated and appears to have limited interaction
      with other drugs, it is a potential important agent in the treatment of invasive fungal
      infections. Although anidulafungin is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in
      adult non-neutropenic patients, dosing guidelines for anidulafungin in (morbidly) obese
      patients are not available. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetic profile of anidulafungin (as
      well as other echinocandins) in this specific patient population is still largely unknown.
      During endoscopic gastric bypass surgery, patients are more prone to various kinds of
      infection, justifying the prophylactic use of anidulafungin in this specific cohort of
      patients.

      To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, obese patients with a BMI ≥ 40 undergoing endoscopic
      gastric bypass surgery will receive a single dose of 100 mg anidulafungin (besides standard
      anti-bacterial prophylaxis) and a PK-curve will be drawn. These PK-values can then be
      compared to the pharmacokinetics in a normal-weight group.

      All obese patients with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 undergoing endoscopic gastric bypass surgery who
      receive a prophylactic single dose of 100 mg anidulafungin will be included in the analysis.
      A PK curve will be determined after administration of anidulafungin at t=0.5, 1, end of
      infusion, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 and (if feasible) 72 hours post infusion (n=12
      samples). Blood samples (4 mL) on PK days will be taken to obtain at least 2.0 mL of plasma.

    <description>The primary outcome measurement will be the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to infinitive (inf) post infusion (AUC0- inf) value of anidulafungin. This will be determined by use of the log-linear trapezoidal rule. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) will be directly observed from the data. The elimination rate constant will be determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the log-linear plasma concentration time curve. Clearance (CL) will be calculated as dose/AUC0- inf.</description>

    <description>Simulate pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin after obtaining all plasma concentrations using modeling software to predict long-term exposure. For this, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to infinitive (inf) post infusion (AUC0- inf), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination half-life and clearance values of anidulafungin will be used (as calculated in outcome measure 1). The PK curve of day 1-3 will serve to calculate these values.</description>
