  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France , 15% of couples seek help for problems conceiving . In 10% of cases, infertility
      remains &quot; unexplained&quot; . Among the causes of female infertility , there are the eating
      disorders, as well as sexual disorders , these two cases may be linked. In addition, data
      from the literature seem to suggest that beyond a diagnosis of eating disorders, the feeding
      behavior of infertile women is more often disturbed than the general population. Moreover,
      the notions of desire for a child and maternal representations seem essential to address in
      the comprehensive care of women with infertility but also TCA integrating all conflicting
      issues reactivated at the time of motherhood. However, little work has been done on this
      subject. Thus, we propose a study on the desire for children and the eating disorders to
      infertile women, to update epidemiological data, but also to better characterize this
      particular patient population. Perspectives of this work are to improve screening measures
      and support through a joint work of doctors reproductive and psychiatrists.
