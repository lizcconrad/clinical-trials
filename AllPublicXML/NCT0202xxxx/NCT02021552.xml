      The specific aim of this is to establish a cohort of severely injured patients admitted to
      our trauma center. Investigators will collect DNA, utilizing discarded blood samples, from
      3000 injury victims in an effort to identify perhaps 50 - 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP) (out of 1000s) that can be used, when taken together, to identify patients at highest
      risk for developing complicated sepsis and death.

    <description>The investigators will be studying whether baseline genetic difference can be used in the future to identify patients at high risk and conversely those at low risk for complicated post-traumatic infections.</description>

        Prospective cohort in which patients with severe injury, defined by combined anatomic
        injuries sufficient to require admission to the intensive care unit for treatment (blood
        transfusions, mechanical support of respiration) and intensive monitoring that is expected
        to be required for more than 24 hours, will be enrolled

        Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Harborview Medical Center after suffering a
        traumatic injury

          -  ability to obtain a 5 ml blood sample

          -  Expected to be in the ICU for more than 24 hours
