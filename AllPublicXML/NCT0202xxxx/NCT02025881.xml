    <textblock>
      The trial includes i) the evaluation of the efficacy of a treatment strategy, designed as a
      phase II trial, and ii) a dose-finding part.

      The Phase II trial is an open label, non-randomized, multicentre trial without control group.
      A Bayesian approach will be used to analyse the EFS, assuming a cure model. We will use three
      prior distributions of the EFS; (1) an enthusiastic prior distribution, (2) a pessimistic
      prior distribution, and (3) a non-informative prior distribution. As the patient outcomes in
      the trial will be recorded, the subsequent distribution of the outcome probability under
      experimental treatment will be computed by applying Bayes' theorem, which yields an estimated
      EFS probability with a 95% credibility interval (measure of Bayesian precision). Two interim
      analyses are planned to monitor the efficacy data (early stopping rules for futility or
      inefficacy).

      The final analysis of efficacy will be made on an intention to treat basis, including all
      recruited patients, 3 years after recruitment of the last patient.

      Due to the uncertainty on the dose of cyclophosphamide that can be given in combination with
      Busilvex for the last chemotherapy course in patients in complete response after
      intensification chemotherapy treatment, a dose-finding subtrial will be performed to address
      this issue (Phase I part). The dose escalation of cyclophosphamide will be performed using
      the Continual Reassessment Method in a Bayesian framework.
