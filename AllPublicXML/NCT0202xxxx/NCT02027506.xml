  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple and non-invasive bedside diagnostic tool with a
      well-established role in the diagnosis of (CAD). Many studies have found that the admission
      of ECG provides important prognostic information in patients admitted with chest pain. For
      instance, T wave inversion in anterior or inferior location and or ST-segment depression has
      been associated with high incidence of CAD.

      The aim of the work will be directed to study the diagnostic value of electrocardiographic
      ST-T wave changes in lead aVL in patients with chronic stable angina

      The ECG findings vary considerably, depending importantly on four major factors: (1) the
      duration of the ischemic process (acute versus evolving or chronic) ; (2) its extent (large
      versus small) ; (3) its topography (anterior versus inferior-posterior and right ventricular)
      ; (4) the presence of other underlying conditions (e.g. LBBB, WPW or pacemaker pattern) that
      can mask or alters the classic pattern.

      The resting electrocardiogram is normal in approximately half of patients with chronic stable
      angina pectoris, and even patients with severe CAD may have a normal tracing at rest. A
      normal resting ECG suggesting a normal LV function and it is unusual finding in a patient
      with an extensive previous infarction.

      The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with chronic CAD are non
      specific ST-Twave changes with or without abnormal Q waves. In addition to myocardial
      ischemia, other conditions that can produce ST-T wave abnormalities include LV hypertrophy or
      dilation, electrolyte abnormalities, neurogenic effects, and anti-arrhythmic drugs.

      In patients with known CAD, however, the occurrence of ST-T wave abnormalities on the resting
      ECG may correlate with the severity of the underlying heart disease. This association may
      explain the adverse association of ST-Twave changes with prognosis of these patients. In
      contrast, a normal resting ECG is more favorable long-term prognostic sign in patients with
      suspected or definite CAD.

        This study will be a prospective observational study conducted on 150 patients admitted at
        the Alexandria university hospitals or referred from secondary hospitals with documented
        CAD as proved by non invasive tests (ECG, echocardiography, treadmill exercise, myocardial
        perfusion imaging or multi-slice CT coronary angiography) requiring invasive coronary
        angiography.
