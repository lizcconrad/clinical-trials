    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and effects of the study
      drug, sorafenib, in adults diagnosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The study will
      evaluate how well the drug is tolerated and its effect on the level of oxygen in the blood
      and the function of the lung vessels.
