    <textblock>
      Systematic efforts to improve colorectal cancer screening use in the VA Healthcare System
      have resulted in an increase in not only appropriate, but also inappropriate use of
      screening. The purpose of this study is to test a new, more patient-centered approach to
      colon cancer screening. In older individuals (ages 70 to 75) who are &quot;due&quot; for screening, the
      investigators will provide education on the benefits and harms of colon cancer screening. But
      instead of simply providing these patients with &quot;average&quot; information about these benefits,
      the investigators will give them information that takes into account their personal
      characteristics (e.g., age, gender), overall health, and screening history and therefore
      applies to them more personally. The investigators will also work with the health system to
      create time and space for patient and doctor to discuss whether screening is the right choice
      for each individual. This way, patients can make an informed choice about what is right for
      them, with the help of their doctor. In the future, the results of this study will help
      patients make more informed screening decisions, especially when the benefits of screening
      may be uncertain for them personally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is a widely recommended, evidence-based preventive service
      that has traditionally been underused. Over the last decade, organized efforts by the
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to increase population screening among Veterans have
      been successful. But these population-centered efforts have increased screening utilization
      in a way that is not always concordant with screening benefit, particularly among older
      Veterans, those with comorbid illness, and those who have previously been screened. As
      patients get older, acquire health problems, and undergo negative screening tests, the
      benefit of screening decreases and the potential harm of screening increases. Yet, existing
      population-centered efforts fail to adequately inform these patients about this changing
      balance in benefit and harm, often yielding screening utilization that is discordant with
      benefit. The purpose of this study is to test a more Veteran-centered approach to screening
      in these individuals, one that encourages informed, personalized screening decisions based on
      individual values, preferences, and health status.

      The 3-part intervention consists of: (1) a decision aid to help Veterans make informed
      screening decisions; (2) education for providers on how the benefits of screening vary
      between patients; and (3) modification of clinical reminder systems to allow Veterans to make
      informed decisions about screening. The intervention will be tested in a pragmatic
      cluster-randomized controlled trial (cluster = provider) at two sites in the VA Ann Arbor
      Healthcare System. The primary outcome will be whether screening was ordered at the clinic
      visit. The investigators will also assess the appropriateness of screening orders (i.e.,
      whether screening is ordered in concordance with screening benefit), conceptual understanding
      of screening, elements of informed decision-making addressed in the screening discussion, and
      screening utilization at 6 months.
