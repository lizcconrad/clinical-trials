      1. To reveal changes of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo tumor in
           the phase II study of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        2. To clarify the meaning of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo
           tumor in predicting the effect of anti-angiogenic therapy.
