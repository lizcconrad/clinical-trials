      All consecutive patients undergone PTCA in the period between July 2013 and December 2013 are
      eligible to be enrolled. Study population are divided in :

      Group 1: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA (100 mg once a day) and Prasugrel (10
      mg die); Group 2: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA(100 mg once a day) and
      Ticagrelor (90 mg twice a day); Control group: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with
      ASA(100 mg once a day) and Clopidogrel (75 mg once a day).

      Platelet function is evaluated using a validated method: the VerifyNow System (Accumetrics
      Inc., San Diego, CA), which is a point-of-care turbidimetry-based optical detection system
      that measures platelet-induced aggregation. These value are measured Platelet function,
      measured with the VerifyNow P2Y12. All patients on chronic dual antiplatelet therapy (&gt;1
      month) quit smoking for a 2 weeks period. Therefore PRU values are obtained at baseline (at
      the enrollment time) and after 2 weeks after smoking cessation. Platelet reactivity are
      expressed in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). PRU values &gt;240 are suggestive of high platelet
      reactivity.

      Primary outcomes: P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at baseline and two weeks after quitting
      smoking.
