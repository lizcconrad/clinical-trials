      Aim: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use feasibility of FreeO2 so as to deliver
      automatically oxygen in the emergency department in a patient population admitted for acute
      respiratory failure.

      Hypothesis: The principal hypothesis is that FreeO2 is possible and well-accepted by nurses
      and medical personnel and there are advantages to use this system. In comparison with the
      common oxygen delivery (the rotameter), the hypothesis is that FreeO2 system will make for a
      better control of the oxygen saturation in function of designed target, reducing the
      desaturation time and hyperoxia. We think that oxygen weaning will be faster than classical
      way if it is automated. In addition, FreeO2 could reduce the number of intervention by nurse
      personnel.
