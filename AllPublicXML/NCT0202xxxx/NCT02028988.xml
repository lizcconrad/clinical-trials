  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called enzalutamide in combination with external
      beam radiation therapy as a possible treatment for prostate cancer. Presently, when
      participants receive hormonal therapy with radiation therapy for prostate cancer, medications
      are given to reduce testosterone levels in the blood stream. This leads to side effects such
      as loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED) and decrease in muscle strength. The purpose
      of this study is test another form of hormonal therapy with radiation therapy. The medication
      called enzalutamide will be used with radiation therapy. Instead of lowering testosterone,
      enzalutamide blocks testosterone in cells. This study will test if enzalutamide when used
      with radiation will lower the PSA without causing the side effects associated with
      medications that lower testosterone in the blood stream.

      -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each of 6 treatment cycles.
           Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the participant will be
           taking the study drug enzalutamide by mouth (4 pills daily). The diary will also include
           special instructions for taking the enzalutamide.

        -  The participant will also be undergoing external beam radiation therapy during the
           study, for a duration of 8 ½-10 weeks. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient
           basis. This part of the study is considered standard of care.

        -  The participant will be required to have fiducial markers placed within the prostate as
           part of this study. These are very small gold markers that are placed in the prostate.
           This procedure is similar to the biopsy that the participant had to diagnose their
           cancer. This procedure is routinely performed to permit imaging and position corrections
           to improve the precision of the external beam (radiation) delivery (Image Guided
           Radiation Therapy). The placement of the three gold markers is performed by an
           Urologist. The fiducials are placed under ultrasound guidance. This is also considered
           standard of care and is not experimental.

        -  Planned Follow-up: Participants will be followed on study at a 3 month follow-up after
           treatment (cessation of enzalutamide). Additional follow-up to assess the status of the
           participant's cancer will be conducted at the discretion of the treating physicians as
           part of the participant's routine medical care.

    <description>On this study patients will be treated with 6 months of Xtandi (enzalutamide). Approximately one-third of the way through this treatment they will receive EBRT. Starting on Day 1, all patients will ingest enzalutamide 160 mg/day at the same time each day without breaks (except as outlined for toxicity), with or without food, for 6 (28 day +/-3 days) cycles. Dose reduction of enzalutamide to 120 mg/day is allowed with the approval of the Medical Monitor. Patients will be instructed to return all unused capsules at each study visit to assess compliance and will receive study drug every 28 days (+/-3 days) for 6 cycles (24 weeks).</description>

    <description>Dose will be normalized such that exactly 98% of the PTV (planned target volume) receives the prescription dose and will be scored as per protocol. The maximum allowable dose within the PTV is 107% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc. The minimum allowable dose within the PTV is &gt;95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc.
EBRT shall receive prescription doses to the PTV 75.6- 79.2 Gy delivered in 1.8 Gy fractions.</description>

             and PSA&lt; 10) prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance who are re-biopsied and
             found to have intermediate risk disease according to the protocol criteria are
             eligible for enrollment within 180 days of the repeat biopsy procedure.

          -  Age 18 years or more.
