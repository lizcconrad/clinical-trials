      This is an international (4 countries) randomized phase III study with 2 cohorts, patients
      will be randomized 1:1 to endocrine therapy (cohort 1: exemestane 25 mg daily, cohort 2:
      fulvestrant 500mg days 1 and 15 cycle 1 and then day 1 every 4 weeks) plus palbociclib (125
      mg daily x3 weeks every 4 weeks) vs. capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice daily x2 weeks every 3
      weeks). Postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 MBC are eligible if resistant to previous NSAI
      (letrozole or anastrozole) in cohort 1 or pevious AI (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane)
      in cohort 2 defined as: recurrence while on or within 12 months after the end of adjuvant
      treatment with NSAI/AI or progression while on or within 1 month after the end of treatment
      with NSAI/AI for MBC. Previous chemotherapy is permitted either in the (neo)adjuvant setting
      and/or as first line for MBC. Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1
      or bone lesions, lytic or mixed, in the absence of measurable disease.

      296 patients have been randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (Arm A: approximately 125
      patients treated with palbociclib plus exemestane) and the control arm (Arm B: approximately
      125 patients treated with capecitabine) before the approval of this protocol version (Cohort
      1).

      Approximately 300 patients will be randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (Arm A:
      approximately 150 patients treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant) and the control arm
      (Arm B: approximately 150 patients treated with capecitabine) from the approval of this
