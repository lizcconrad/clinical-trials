      Primary Objective:

      To investigate the efficacy(HbA1c) at 6 months after adding basal insulin therapy (insulin
      glargine) to dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and metformin plus or minus sulphonylurea

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the efficacy by adding insulin glargine

        2. To assess insulin dose

        3. Safety

             before screening

          -  Considered not physically or psychologically appropriate to participate in clinical
             study by investigator

          -  Not willing to comply with scheduled visit, self-inject insulin, or self-monitor blood
