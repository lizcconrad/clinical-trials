  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetically transmitted blood disease, necessitates life-long
      care. In children, the disease may cause intense pain and other severe complications. Studies
      show that sources of stress, as well as complex psychological and intercultural issues
      associated with SCD, often aggravate symptoms. At Louis Mourier hospital, the treatment model
      used is systematic psychological and medical care. Our hypothesis is that this care is
      beneficial for both the children and their families as seen in improved quality of life and
      positive impact on medical symptoms.

      In this observational multicentric pilot study, our goal is to assess the effectiveness of a
      systematic medical-psychological approach in place for the past 6 years at the Louis Mourier
      Hospital, as compared to the usual practice in 2 other pediatric hospitals for SCD which
      focus essentially on the medical issues associated with SCD. Two psychologists will interview
      80 children and their primary care-takers at Louis Mourier hospital, and 80 children and
      their care-takers of the other two centers, using a standard comprehensive care for SCD. For
      the parents, we propose to use a semi-structured interview including a prepared interview
      guide, the Loneliness Questionnaire, and the parents' version of KIDSCREEN (10 items). For
      the children, according to their age, The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), the Draw
      a Person in the Rain Test (DPR), the KIDSCREEN questionnaire, and semi-directed interview
      will be used. Relevant information from the patients' medical record directly related to the
      symptomatic expression of the SCD will be noted on a data collection form. This phase is
      scheduled to last 12 months. A statistical and qualitative analysis of the results will be
      carried out at the end of the study.
