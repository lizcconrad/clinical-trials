    <textblock>
      Invasive Aspergillus infection (IAI) occasionally occurs in immunocompromised people. Except
      administrating empirical anti-fungal agent, using objective parameters to support the
      tentative diagnosis of an IAI in order to make the anti-fungal treatment more specifically is
      also important. At present, serum galactomannan (GM) test is the less-invasive, non-cultural,
      and time-saving examination for augmenting a diagnosis of Aspergillosis. It was suggested by
      Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 2008 as a screening and monitoring tool for
      Aspergillosis , and the cut-off value was adjusted to 0.5 by USA FDA . However, in clinical
      practice, GM seems not to have good predicted value even the sensitivity and specificity are
      declaimed more than 80% . Other controversial issues include the reproducibility of GM5 and
      the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam or other antibiotics on the accuracy of GM baseline In
      this study, serum GMs are examined in two conditions, one is collected for establishing a
      baseline and the other is collected after piperacillin-tazobactam administration. We hope to
      confirm the validity of GM baseline and the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam on GM value in
      Taiwan.

      We try to enroll patient who are followed in hematology department in TCVGH and are diagnosed
      as probable pulmonary Aspergillus infection or proven pulmonary Aspergillus infection. If
      they have poor response to current thought effective agent for pulmonary Aspergillus (eg,
      amphotericin B, Voriconazole, itraconazole) 2 weeks, then they can choose to receive
      Posaconazole as salvage therapy in our study. However, our study wants to quantification of
      therapeutic response, so the enrolled patient should be agree to let us check serum
      galactomannan level at beginning and per 2 weeks. They also should be receive chest CT in the
      beginning and in the end of posaconazole treatment. The rule out timing is evaluated by
      clinical doctors (hematology department) per 2 weeks, if posaconazole has poor effect to
      their disease, the clinical doctors can decided to terminate posaconazole administration.
      Another effective agent will be given when posaconazole fails.
