    <textblock>
      This clinical utility study pilot is based on a review of real but de-identified and
      randomized patient cases and aims to evaluate Urologists' treatment recommendations before
      and after reviewing the results provided by the Decipher test. This is a pilot study and the
      primary intent is to help guide development and design of future clinical utility studies for
      Decipher
