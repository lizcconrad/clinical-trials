  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical gene transfer study that aims to verify the safety and efficacy of the use
      of the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector to introduce the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into
      the hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected with severe combined immunodeficiency due
      to ADA deficiency. The EFS-ADA vector expresses the human ADA cDNA under the control of the
      elongation factor alpha short promoter (EFS). In addition, this protocol will examine the
      effects of the ADA gene transfer on the immune system of treated patients. Patients with ADA
      deficiency and ineligible for matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are
      eligible to participate in the study. To increase engraftment and selected advantage or
      gene-corrected cells, busulfan will be used as a cytoreductive agent. Enzyme replacement
      (PEG-ADA) will be discontinued 30 days after infusion of gene-corrected cells. CD34+
      hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow, peripheral blood or
      cord blood, exposed to lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer and re-infused into the
      patient through a peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular follow-up studies
      will assess safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure.

               5. Other conditions which in the opinion of the principal investigator and/or
                  co-investigators, contra-indicate the bone marrow harvest, the administration of
                  busulfan, infusion of transduced cells or indicate the patient or patient s
                  parents/primary caregivers inability to follow protocol.

                    -  DFSP is a rare, locally invasive tumor with low metastatic potential.
                       Patients receiving active anti-neoplastic therapy for any cancer, including
                       DFSP, are not eligible. Patients with DFSP who are not being treated with
                       active anti-neoplastic therapy at the time of enrollment AND have no plan to
                       receive active anti-neoplastic therapy in the absence of progressive
                       malignant disease AND whose DFSP is not expected to be life-limiting within
                       the five years following the infusion of genetically corrected cells are
                       eligible.

        Patients with DFSP, for whom radiation or chemotherapy has been chosen, would remain
        ineligible during treatment, as the interaction of busulfan and the experimental gene
        transfer vectors with active anti-neoplastic therapy is difficult to predict and could
        reasonably be expected to be deleterious due to overlapping toxicities. When
        anti-neoplastic therapy is concluded, patients with ADA-SCID and a history of DFSP can be
        included.
