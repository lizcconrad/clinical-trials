    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies ultrasound imaging in finding prostate cancer in patients
      undergoing surgery. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound imaging, may help find and
      diagnose prostate cancer. This study will serve as an analysis of the Histo-Scanning
      technology for the purpose of determining its ability to identify sites of prostate cancer at
      the time of prostate ultrasound.
