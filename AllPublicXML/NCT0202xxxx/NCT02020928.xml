      Setting: Oral mucositis is a very common complication of cancer treatment, accounting, often
      at increased risk for infections and even the interruption of treatment, interfering with the
      prognosis of the disease. The low intensity laser therapy has been proposed as an alternative
      for the treatment and prevention of this side effect, with good results in terms of clinical
      and functional, speeding up the process of wound healing and reducing pain.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of using low power laser in the prevention of oral
      mucositis in patients with hematological cancer, undergoing chemotherapy for bone marrow
      transplantation.

      Methods: There will be a Clinical Trial Randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of using low power laser in the prevention of oral mucositis in patients with
      hematological cancer, undergoing chemotherapy for bone marrow transplantation. Participate in
      the study, patients who are in the condition mentioned above accepting participate and have
      aged over 18. Will be excluded from the study patients who have autoimmune disease, which
      present sensitivity to laser or who have already started treatment for oral mucositis prior
      to this study.The study variables are:-independent variable: whether or not the red laser of
      low power-dependent variables: oral mucositis, degree of mucositis, chemotherapy regimen,
      type of blood cancer. For determining the association between the independent variable and
      the dependent will be used chi-square tests of association (Pearson) and Fisher's exact test,
      if necessary. Will calculate the risk ratio (RR) as a measure of relative risk, with the
      confidence interval at 95% (IC95%).Also be calculated NNT (number needed to treat to obtain
      benefit) and NNH (number needed to harm getting). Will be adopted a significance level of 5%.
      The project was approved by the Ethics and Research iMIP. All patients will be appropriately
      informed about the objectives of the project and will only be included if they voluntarily
      agree to participate by signing the consent form.

    <description>The Low level laser therapy application is performed from the first day of conditioning of the patient until the second day after bone marrow transplantation (D + 2). The patients are divided into two groups. The first will contain the patients who will receive the red laser light, whereas the second will cover patients who receive sham or placebo controlled - the device is triggered, but not deliver the laser light.</description>
