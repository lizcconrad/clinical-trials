  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  We have previously reported the results of the primary and secondary outcomes of a
           randomized study aiming to investigate the impact of a restrictive transfusion protocol
           on the magnitude of reduction in blood transfusion in a typically mixed general surgery
           population subjected to major abdominal surgery.

        -  The main finding of that study was a reduction in red blood cell usage with the
           implementation of a restrictive transfusion regimen. This was achieved without adversely
           affecting clinical outcome in the population studied.

        -  The aim of this secondary analysis performed on a subgroup of 20 patients from the
           original study was to determine whether there are any differences in the postoperative
           immunologic response, as expressed by the production of inflammatory mediators, between
           a restrictive approach to red cell transfusion and a more liberal strategy.
