  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the good and bad effects when regorafenib is used
      instead of standard combination chemotherapy. It is not known if taking regorafenib versus
      standard chemotherapy will have better, worse or the same results.

    <measure>overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start to death or last follow up. Survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (defined with RECIST 1.1 criteria at 16 weeks (2nd scan) as CR, PR or SD), will be estimated using proportions and exact binomial 95% confidence intervals provided.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0.

    <description>This is an open-label, phase II study of regorafenib for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The treatment will be repeated every week for three weeks on and one week off. Patients will be evaluated for response after every 2 cycles (8 weeks).</description>

    <description>All patients that meet the eligibility criteria who have signed informed consent and have enrolled on the trial will be treated with regorafenib, daily 3 weeks on 1 week off for all cycles. Dose will be escalated to 120 mg in week 2 of cycle 1 and all remaining cycles if no excess toxicity is experienced by the patient at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>

               -  Metastatic disease, unresectable disease involving one or more sites including
                  liver, lung, lymph nodes and peritoneum, with each nodule measuring ≤3cm OR no
                  more than two sites of disease (two nodules) &gt;4.5 cm.

          -  ECOG 0 or 1

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and liver function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements:

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limits of normal (ULN)

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino-transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 xULN (≤ 5 x
             ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer)

          -  Alkaline phosphastase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement
             of their cancer)

          -  Lipase ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

             undergo a pregnancy test.

             carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor. Subjects surviving a cancer that was

             enrollment are allowed.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or current chronic or
