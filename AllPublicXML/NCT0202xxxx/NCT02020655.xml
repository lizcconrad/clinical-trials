      Background: A pressure ulcer is localized tissue injury to the superficial layer of the skin
      and/ or the underlying tissue. Pressure ulcers are most likely to develop in skin areas
      exposed to pressure, shear and friction. Shear- force is an important contributing factor and
      wound dressing are possibly capable to reduce shear force at the skin. At this moment there's
      no good marker to detect the effect of shear- force at the skin. A potential marker could be
      cytokines (IL-1α) which are released after mechanical loading of the skin. A previous study
      have shown a significant increased level of IL-1α after the application of pressure. We want
      to investigate if these cytokines are significant increased after the application of shear-
      force at the skin.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to gather knowledge about cytokine concentrations
      (IL-1 α) in the skin of healthy volunteers after the application of shear- force. We want to
      use this knowledge in the future to investigate if different prophylactic wound dressings are
      capable to reduce shear force at the skin. This could be interesting in the prevention of
      pressure ulcers.

      Study design: With the use of a special developed shear- force model are we going to
      administer 20 Newton (2 kg) shear at the palmar side of the under arm in 10 healthy
      volunteers for 30 minutes. As a control we ware going to put the shear- force model at the
      other arm without the application of shear- force. Before the use of the shear- force model
      we will perform cytokine measurements with the use of Sebutape. Sebutape is capable to absorb
      cytokines from the skin. After the use of the shear force- model we will perform cytokine
      measurements again. Then we will extract the cytokines from the Sebutape with the use of
      ELISA.
