      The investigators aim to evaluate the preferences for anaesthesia methods of gravid women who
      are to deliver baby by caesarean section, the rates of general anaesthesia and regional
      anaesthesia, the reasons for preferences of general anaesthesia and regional anaesthesia and
      the factors affecting these preferences.

      A questionnaire consisting of 20 questions were applied to gravid women applying for delivery
      by elective caesarean operation, at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine Hospital for
      Gynaecology and Obstetrics between February 2010 and February 2011, in order to study the
      anaesthesia technique the patients prefer and the reason behind their preferences. Those
      gravid women who accepted to take part in the study were provided information about the
      questionnaire and their oral and written approvals were obtained.
