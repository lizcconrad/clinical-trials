  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking ipilimumab
      with degarelix before surgery to remove the prostate, followed by more degarelix and
      ipilimumab after the surgery, will have on prostate cancer.

      The goal of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a multimodality approach
      combining hormones and immunotherapy in prostate cancer populations that are considered
      incurable and standardly treated with hormones alone, and represent clinical states prior to
      development of castration-resistant disease. There are 2 cohorts. The first will use
      ipilimumab and degarelix prior to and following radical prostatectomy in men with newly
      diagnosed, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive disease. The second cohort will include men
      who have already received definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy but have since
      experienced biochemical and/or metastatic recurrence.
