  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients, age ≥ 18 years, with clinically diagnosed mild, moderate or severe brain
      trauma will be asked to participate in the study. This prospective database will consist of
      400 subjects with TBI, 200 from both TUCH and Cambridge Addenbrooke's Hospital. In addition,
      100 controls will be recruited, with 50 from both centres.This study is a prospective
      clinical observational study with detailed data collecting. All patients will be treated
      according to the accepted, standardized, existing guidelines that are based on national and
      international recommendations. New treatment interventions will NOT be evaluated during the
      data acquisition for this study.

      Aim in this study is to collect large amounts of data in adult subject population, who have
      suffered mild, moderate or severe brain trauma. This data will be added up to the existing
      large TBI databases from IMPACT as well as to the retrospective brain trauma data sets
      collected at the Turku University Hospital after the year 1995 and to the prospectively
      collected existing data set from the University of Cambridge.

      Data will contain patient characteristics, injury mechanisms, and patients' physiological
      status and findings immediately after the incident as well as through the processes of
      diagnostics, emergency treatment and in-hospital care. All data during these phases will
      follow the recommendations of Common Data Elements (advanced version) in TBI studies by the
      IMPACT investigators.

      Immediate head CT will be performed according to the existing guidelines, and head MRI with
      modern techniques as soon as the patient's wellbeing will allow the imaging to be done.

      During the intensive care unit (ICU) visit a database of EEG signals will be collected and
      the relevant information components will be extracted to provide inputs for the care decision
      algorithm. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of continuous EEG monitoring on the
      detection of epileptic seizures and other adverse events to enable rapid intervention during
      the patient's ICU stay and to improve outcome prediction.

      The investigators will also search new metabolomic, lipidomic, and genetic biomarkers related
      to TBIs through analyzing blood samples drawn in different time points.

      Based on all these factors, simulation models will be brought up as to help clinicians
      determine the earliest possible prognosis and to decide, whether patient would benefit from a
      particular care during the acute phase of a TBI.

        Adult patients, age ≥ 18 years, with clinically diagnosed mild, moderate or severe brain
        trauma will be asked to participate in the study. If such possible subjects are either
        unconscious, sedated or confused to the extent, that no personal decisions can be drawn,
        her next of kin will be asked for the permission to include the subject in question to the
        study. Control group subjects will be patients with acute orthopaedic injuries without any
        signs of eventual concomitant brain trauma of any degree. The source populations will
        consist of citizens from the local catchment areas of the participating centres.
