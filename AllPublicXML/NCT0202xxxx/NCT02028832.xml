      This study will investigate if adding complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage
      and reiki to inpatient pediatric care is feasible and what the effects are on outcomes such
      as patient symptoms, cost, safety, satisfaction and length of stay.

      Study Objective: To determine if a pediatric integrative medicine (PIM) service is effective
      in reducing overall symptoms of pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or anxiety (PNVA), length of stay,
      and costs, in hospitalized children when compared to conventional care. In this context,
      &quot;integrative&quot; refers to a combined approach of complementary and conventional medical
      therapies in an evidence-based fashion.

      Design: cluster trial; 2-arm controlled evaluation study in pediatric oncology, general
      pediatrics and pediatric cardiology. Intervention will be offered during a 6-month PIM period
      following a 6 month control period.

      Population: Inclusion criteria: (i) In-patients in participating division and (ii) informed
      consent/assent. Exclusion criteria: (i) lack of parent participation, fluency in English, or
      informed consent

      Intervention: Recommendations for specific CAM therapies will be determined by a staff PIM
      pediatrician. Any combination of the following CAM therapies (dose, duration, amount to be
      based on patient need as assessed by CAM provider, patient, and parent):
      acupuncture/acupressure, massage, Reiki; all are to be offered in addition to usual care.

      Control: Usual care.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: feasibility (i.e enrollment); Secondary outcomes: (i) PNVA symptom
      management, (ii) need for conventional pharmacotherapy, (iii) adverse events; (iv) parent and
      health care provider satisfaction with care provided, v) length of stay; and vi)
      cost-effectiveness (analysis of this outcome to be limited to patients admitted for at least
      2 days and for not more than 30 days).

      Significance: To our knowledge, this study will be the first comparative effectiveness trial
      to assess the impact of PIM for hospitalized children with cancer.
