  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the post-marketing study is to collect safety and effectiveness data
      for 5 years on subjects treated with Prolieve®. The collection of 5-year safety information
      will be used to evaluate the occurrence of any long-term side effects from the treatment. The
      collection of long-term effectiveness data on subjects treated with Prolieve® will provide
      information on the long-term effects of treatment and time to re- treatment (any treatment
      initiated for BPH since Prolieve'&quot; treatment, including a second treatment with Prolieve&quot;).

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to re-treatment will be estimated using Kaplan Meier estimation techniques. The re-treatment rate at years 1 through 5 will be estimated and 95% confidence intervals obtained, and the median time to re-treatment will be estimated. Subjects who receive re-treatment will be classed as treatment failures. Subjects who are lost to follow-up will be considered as re-treated at their last known study visit. In addition, a missing at random (MAR) analysis will be performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in American Urological Association (AUA) Total Score at 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured based on the number of subjects who worsened, had no change (1-29%), had a 30% or greater improvement or who are missing, based on the change in AUA total score compared to individual baseline for each follow-up evaluation. A responder analysis will also be done on peak flow rate (PFR) with the following categories: the number of subjects who worsened, had no change (1-19%), had a 20% or greater improvement or who are missing, based on the change in PFR compared to individual baseline for each follow-up evaluation.</description>

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects whose pain response has been significantly decreased by any means (because
             the subject's ability to detect pain is a treatment safety mechanism).

          -  Subject with a history of any illness or surgery that might confound the results of
             the study &quot; or impede the successful completion of trial&quot;

          -  Subject with a history of any illness for which the Prolieve® treatment may pose
             additional risk to the subject.

          -  Subject with the confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate

          -  Subject with the confirmed or suspected bladder cancer

          -  PSA &gt;10 ng/mL

          -  Subject with previous treatment to the prostate (e.g., surgery, balloon dilation,
             stents, laser, TUNA, or Indigo prostatectomy) and/or non-metallic urogenital implants

             multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes, or other disease
             process.

          -  Residual bladder volume &gt;250 mL measured by ultrasound.

          -  Compromised renal function (i.e., serum creatinine levels above 1.8 mg/dL).

                  at least three months with a stable voiding pattern. The drug dose will not be
                  altered or discontinued for the entrance into or throughout the study.

               2. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and gonadotropin releasing hormonal analog.

               3. Alpha blockers, antidepressants, androgens, within one week of treatment.

          -  Subject interested in future fertility/fathering children.

          -  Subject with full urinary retention.

          -  Subject with bleeding disorder or liver dysfunction associated with a bleeding
