      -  Trial objective: To test the hypothesis that remote per-postconditioning in connection
           with primary PCI will reduce myocardial infarct size patients with STEMI.

        -  Trial Design: Placebo controlled randomized study with parallel groups

        -  Primary Endpoint: Myocardial infarct size expressed as a percentage of the myocardium at
           risk determined by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) day 4-7

        -  Efficacy Parameters: Myocardial infarct size expressed as a percentage to the myocardium
           at risk determined by CMR at 6 months.

        -  Global left ventricular function determined by left ventricular ejection fraction
           determined by CMR.

        -  Microvascular obstruction determined by CMR day 4-7. Quantified ECV (extracellular
           volume) in left ventricular as myocardium at risk day 4-7 and remodelling parameters day
           180.

        -  Safety Parameters: Major adverse cardiovascular events.

    <description>Remote conditioning is induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the left thigh to 200 mmHg or 20 mmHg above systolic blood pressure (if &gt;180 mmHg) for 5 min followed by deflation for 5 min. At least one of these conditioning cycles is performed before PCI is initiated. If time allows, cycles of remote conditioning (5 min leg ischemia and 5 min reperfusion) are repeated until PCI is performed. Following reperfusion, defined as first balloon inflation, four additional cycles of remote conditioning will be performed.</description>
