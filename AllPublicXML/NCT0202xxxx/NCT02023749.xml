  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of nut consumption on metabolic parameters and
      biomarkers related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function in Korean
      adults with metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary intervention study was designed. Subjects with
      metabolic syndrome and body mass index ≥23 kg/m2 were randomized to the Nut group, which were
      supplemented with 30 g of mixed nuts including walnuts, peanuts, and pine nuts for 6 weeks;
      or allocated to the Control group. Metabolic markers were evaluated at baseline and at the
      end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were enrolled if their body mass index (BMI) was ≥23 kg/m2 and they met the
             criteria for metabolic syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded if they had a nut allergy, peptic disorder, a history of cancer
             or cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, or
             stroke, or established chronic diseases such as chronic renal insufficiency or
             cirrhosis. Subjects were also excluded if they:1) were receiving treatment with
             hypoglycemic agents for diabetes or had HbA1c &gt;7%; 2) were receiving corticosteroid
             treatment; 3) had started antihypertensive or lipid-lowering agents, or changed their
             doses within the previous month; 4) had a weight change ≥5 % of body weight during the
             three months prior to the study; 5) were pregnant; or 6) were regular nut consumers
             (&gt;15g/day of nuts at least three times a week).
