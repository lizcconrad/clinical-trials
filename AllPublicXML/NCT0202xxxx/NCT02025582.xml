    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Toe Walking (ITW) is a diagnosis normally of exclusion and likely, consequently,
      is approached in vastly varying ways of intervention, including serial casting, Botox
      injections and physical therapy. There is some evidence in the literature that children with
      ITW can somewhat correct their lack of heel-strike gait pattern at least temporarily. Kinesio
      Taping (KT) method is an intervention that is used in the outpatient physical therapy setting
      for various conditions such as post-operative edema, muscle facilitation of weakened rotator
      cuff muscles, and functional corrections in children with torticollis. This pilot study will
      strive to determine if KT may be effective by providing proprioceptive and neuromuscular
      re-education through thermal and mechanical fascial impositions, thereby improving passive
      joint range of motion (ROM) through reduction of passive muscle stiffness and improving
      ambulation through neuromuscular re-education in children with idiopathic toe walking. We
      will quantify passive muscle stiffness of the gastrocnemius and opposing anterior tibialis
      using non-invasive Shear Wave Elastography (SWE). Further we look at the kinematics and
      kinetics of the child's ankle during the gait cycle to further determine any effect(s) of KT
      on functional walking outcome measures. The intent is that the results from this study will
      serve as a platform from which to expound look at the long-term, if any, effects of KT on the
      muscle property and gait cycle pattern in children with ITW.

    <description>To evaluate effect of KT on passive ankle ROM, we will measure passive ankle ROM before and after treatment. With the child laying prone, measurements of ankle ROM will be taken using a goniometer with the knee extended and with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The rationale for this is to differentiate gastrocnemius muscle from soleus muscle, with gastrocnemius contributing to ankle ROM loss when knee is extended because it crosses both joints.</description>

    <description>In children with ITW, gait changes, as measured by ankle kinetics and kinematics, have been shown as toe-walking improves. In ITW, presence of a first ankle rocker, presence of an early third ankle rocker, and predominant early ankle moment on advanced gait analysis are used to classify idiopathic toe walking into three severity groups. Changes to these parameters are used to evaluate effect of treatment on ITW. Therefore, we propose to use these parameters to classify the severity of the ITW before and after KT treatment to evaluate effect of KT on ambulation.</description>

    <measure>Supersonic Shearwave Ultrasound Elastography: Change in muscle elasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment, upon completion of taping (2-3 weeks after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Currently, there is indirect evidence that children with ITW have increased passive stiffness of the gastrocnemius muscle, and no evidence with regard to passive stiffness of the anterior tibialis, a major ankle plantar flexion antagonist. Abnormal passive stiffness of these muscles is thought to result in the loss of passive ROM and changes to ambulation. However, direct measurements of passive muscles stiffness in children have not been able to be done, until recently. Therefore, we propose to quantify the passive muscle stiffness of the gastrocnemius muscle and anterior tibialis muscle in children with ITW before and after KT treatment using SWE.</description>
