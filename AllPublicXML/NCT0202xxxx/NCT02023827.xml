  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile crime imposes enormous costs on victims, on society, and on juvenile offenders
      themselves. However, research assessing the efficacy of interventions for young offenders
      show, on average, only small effects on recidivism, substance abuse, and other behavioral
      outcomes. A major problem with existing interventions is that they tend to neglect individual
      differences in motivation and readiness to make positive changes. In earlier research, we
      used an empirically validated model of behavior change, the Transtheoretical Model (TTM, the
      &quot;stage&quot; model), and expert system technology to develop the Rise Above Your Situation program
      (RAYS), a prototype of a multimedia computerized tailored intervention designed as an adjunct
      to traditional juvenile justice programs. The intervention delivers assessments and
      individualized feedback matched to readiness to stay out of trouble with the law and quit
      alcohol and drugs. At the end each session the program also generates a helpgiver report that
      summarizes the youth's feedback and presents concrete, easy-to-implement strategies
      helpgivers can use to reinforce stage-matched concepts. In the current research, the goals
      are to complete development of the computerized tailored intervention; develop training and
      other support materials for helpgivers; and assess the efficacy of the intervention package
      in a randomized clinical trial involving 700 medium- to high-risk court-involved juveniles
      aged 13-17 recruited by 54 probation officers randomly assigned to treatment or standard
      care. Primary outcomes will be criminal recidivism and substance abuse abstinence at 6 and 12
      months follow-up.

  <detailed_description>

      Fifty-four probation officers employed by the Iowa's Juvenile Court Services agreed to
      participate in the study and to be randomly assigned to treatment or standard care. A
      Multiattribute Utility Measurement Approach (Graham, Flay, Johnson, Hansen, &amp; Collins, 1984)
      was used to ensure that probation officers assigned to the two conditions were approximately
      equivalent on level of education, years of experience working with juvenile offenders, number
      of hours of training on the TTM, and confidence using the TTM in their work.

      Probation officers were responsible for recruiting moderate- and high-risk youth on
      probation, and delivering baseline assessment sessions and intervention sessions. However,
      local project site coordinators were available to provide assistance, as needed.

      Computerized follow-up assessments and urine drug testing at 6 and 12 months follow-up are
      being administered by &quot;trackers&quot; at a time and place that is convenient for the youth. Study
      protocols include best practices (Scott, 2004) for maximizing retention at follow-up in
      research involving high-risk populations.

    <description>The Rise Above Your Situation program (RAYS) is a multimedia computer-tailored intervention that relies on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and expert system technology to deliver assessments, feedback, printed reports, and helpgiver reports with intervention ideas. Helpgivers (probation officers in this case) use the reports to guide 1/2 hour follow-up discussions to reinforce intervention ideas and provide support.</description>
