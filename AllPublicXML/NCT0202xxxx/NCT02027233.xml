      This study assesses the seasonal of influenza vaccine effectiveness in adults hospitalised
      with laboratory-confirmed influenza through a network of hospitals in France.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccination strategies aim at protecting high-risk population from severe outcomes.
      Estimating the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against influenza related hospitalisation
      is important to guide these strategies. The objective is to measure the population
      effectiveness of influenza vaccine in patients hospitalized with virologically confirmed
      influenza laboratory during 3 influenza seasons 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 in a
      French hospital network. An interim analysis is provided for each influenza season and an
      overall analysis of 3 seasons.

      This is a study &quot;case-control&quot; involving a nasopharyngeal sample for all hospitalised
      patients presenting an influenza-like illness within seven days. Cases will be patients
      RT-PCR positive for influenza. Controls will be patients negative for any influenza virus.
