    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a classroom teachers' educational
      intervention on 1st and 2nd grades children's physical activity level and energy expenditure
      during physical education classes in elementary public schools, in São Paulo, Brazil.

      This study is a School-based Randomized Controlled Trial. Three-step cluster sampling was
      used for subject selection. In the first step, 8 schools in the Vila Mariana district - São
      Paulo were selected and assigned randomly to physical activity intervention (3 schools) or
      control condition (5 schools). In the second step, all 48 classes from the 1st and 2nd grades
      were selected. In the third step, 352 children were randomly selected compose the
      observational group. In both groups, questionnaire data and SOFIT's observation were
      collected two times: &quot;pre&quot; (immediately before the intervention), and &quot;post&quot; (immediately
      after the intervention), with a six weeks interval between them. No educational intervention
      was taken place in the control schools while the project was running. Afterwards control
      schools received training.

    <description>From eight elementary Public Schools we randomly selected three to receive an educational intervention for teachers. In order to evaluate intervention results, all the 1st and 2nd grades, from exposed and unexposed schools were nominated to have selected children. In each class, eight children were randomly selected. To assess children's level of physical activity, Physical Education classes were recorded. The videotapes analysis set the level of student's physical activity, teacher's attitude, and the class context. The observation instrument used was SOFIT - System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time. We analyzed and discussed the change in children's Physical Activity Level and Energy Expenditure before and after the Educational Intervention to classroom teachers, with a six weeks interval.</description>

    <description>Intervention was applied to classroom teachers by the RRIDA Project team. Training lasted six weeks, 12 hours devoted to physical activity and 18 hours to nutritional content. Modules of educational activities were taught in order to be replicated at PE classes to 1st and 2nd grades' children of three exposed schools. Physical activity module was based on a theoretical approach of physical activity benefits and risks for health, children's physical fitness and activity patterns, physical education and change behavior models. In each meeting the PE professionals, performed PE classes with the classroom teachers as students, focusing in strategies to keep them in movement for the most of PE class time to stimulate students' joint participation instead of individual participation or games.</description>
