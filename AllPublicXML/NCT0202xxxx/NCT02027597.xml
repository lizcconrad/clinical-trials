  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated if computer games can be effective at changing the way children take
      care of their teeth. We a museum exhibit with 3D virtual reality games called &quot;Attack of the
      S. Mutans!&quot; Our hypothesis was that children who played the games and visited the exhibit
      would show improved attitudes about oral health, which would translate into improved brushing
      and self-care habits.

      In this randomized controlled study with school children aged 8-12, we compared the outcomes
      for three groups: Group 1) Visited Attack of the S. Mutans!; Group 2) Experienced a hands-on
      classroom presentation about virtual reality being used for healthcare; Group 3) Received
      no-treatment.

    <measure>Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Follow-up surveys were conducted at 3 points after the intervention for all groups. The survey included questions about the children's attitudes (self-efficacy) toward oral health and taking care of their teeth. Surveys were paper-pencil self-reports from both parents and children. Items were drawn from Morowatisharifabad and Shirazi, (2007) and adapted for ease of understanding for English speaking children.</description>

    <time_frame>8 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Separate surveys of children and their parents were conducted at 3 points after the intervention all groups. The survey included questions about how often and how well the children took care of their teeth.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Oral health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>we assessed children's oral health knowledge in two ways. First, children reported their overall oral health knowledge using three-point rating scales (=not really to 3=mostly) to respond to six items, including, &quot;By brushing and flossing my teeth, I am less susceptible to tooth decay.&quot; Negatively worded items were reverse-coded, and the estimated internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the pre-game survey was.49. Second, children indicated their brushing knowledge using five-point rating scales (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) to respond to four items, including &quot;Tooth brushing gets rid of bad breath.&quot;</description>

    <description>Children assigned to the Treatment-Plus conditions not only had the Attack of the S.

These students received a special login and password in the mail and were instructed to visit the site before completing their next questionnaire.</description>
