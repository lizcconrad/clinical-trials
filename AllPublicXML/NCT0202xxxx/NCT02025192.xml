      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tucatinib (ONT-380) and to assess the safety and tolerability of
      tucatinib (ONT-380) combined with capecitabine alone, trastuzumab alone and with both
      capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label study of tucatinib (ONT-380) given in combination with
      capecitabine alone, trastuzumab alone and with both capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients
      with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.

      Phase 1 will use a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate escalating dose levels of tucatinib
      (ONT-380) in each of these three combinations in order to identify the maximal tolerated
      dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of tucatinib (ONT-380). Capecitabine will be given
      at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID on Days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Trastuzumab will be given as a
      loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg once every 21 days. However, a loading dose of
      trastuzumab will not be given to patients who have received trastuzumab within 4 weeks of the
      first study dose of trastuzumab. These patients will receive trastuzumab at 6 mg/kg each
      cycle, including Cycle 1. Trastuzumab may also be given on a weekly basis at 2 mg/kg IV q 7
      days, but only in the circumstance that trastuzumab infusion has been delayed, and weekly
      infusions are required to resynchronize the cycle length to 21 days, after discussion with
      the medical monitor. Trastuzumab infusion rates will be per institutional guidelines.
      Tucatinib (ONT-380) will be given PO BID at a dose dependent upon the dosing cohorts to which
      the patient is enrolled.

      There will be 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled in each cohort in the dose escalation phase,
      unless that dose is found to be intolerable prior to completion of enrollment. At least 6
      evaluable patients are to be treated at a dose level in order for an MTD/RP2D to be
      determined.

      The MTD/RP2D of tucatinib (ONT-380) to be used in combination with either capecitabine alone
      (Combination 1) or trastuzumab alone (Combination 2) will be determined prior to evaluating
      tucatinib (ONT-380) in combination with both capecitabine and trastuzumab (Combination 3). If
      Combination 1 and Combination 2 are found to be tolerable, then tucatinib (ONT-380) will be
      evaluated in Combination 3, using the lowest MTD/RP2D or other SMC-recommended dose of
      tucatinib (ONT-380) determined for either of the two drug combinations. This will be followed
      by enrollment of an expansion cohort of patients treated at the MTD/RP2D for Combination 3.
      Additional expansion cohorts for either Combination 1 (tucatinib (ONT-380) and capecitabine)
      or Combination 2 (tucatinib (ONT-380) and trastuzumab) may also be enrolled.

      Provided that only seven dose cohorts are needed for dose escalation and only the expansion
      cohort for Combination 3 is enrolled, up to 66 evaluable patients may be enrolled. Additional
      patients may be enrolled if additional expansion cohorts are opened.
