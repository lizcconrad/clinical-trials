    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Atorvastatin in
      combination with multimodality therapy of concurrent radiotherapy plus temozolomide followed
      by adjuvant temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size
      is 32 individuals.
