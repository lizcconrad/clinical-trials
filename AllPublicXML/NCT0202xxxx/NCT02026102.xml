    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a &quot;toolkit&quot; of
      patient decision aids (PtDAs) for heart failure patients who are considering an ICD implant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Examine acceptability and feasibility of a toolkit of patient decision aids
      (PtDAs) for patients with heart failure referred for primary prevention implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators using a randomized control trial design across three diverse
      health care systems (Kaiser Colorado, The University of Colorado, and The Denver Veterans
      Hospital).

        1. Measure the acceptability of the decision aids

        2. Explore feasibility by measuring patient participation rates and adherence to the study
           protocol across all three sites.

        3. Conduct a preliminary assessment of outcomes by measuring changes in decision quality
           (knowledge and value concordance), quality of life, depressive symptoms, health status,
           and spiritual well-being.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the relative value of the various tools in the toolkit through
      in-depth interviews from study participants and providers at each intervention site

    <description>Determine the relative value of the various tools in the toolkit through in-depth interviews from study participants and providers at each intervention site.
We will ask participants the following questions:
Have you made a decision about getting or not getting the ICD?
What information did you use to make your decision?
How are you feeling about your decision?
What else would have been helpful in making your decision?
(Intervention only) Did you use any of the decision aids you were given?
If yes, please tell us how you used them? Did the decision aids make you feel better or worse about your decision? Did you like one of them better than the others? Is there any aspect that wasn't helpful?
If no, please tell us why not? What would have been helpful?
Do you have any advice on the best way to deliver these decision aids to future patients?</description>

At that time, participants will have the option of using all of the decision aids or just some of the decision aids. Participants who do not have access to the internet, will be offered a DVD (digital video disc) version of the video and they will be asked if they would like to arrange a visit where they can review the website with the research assistant.</description>
