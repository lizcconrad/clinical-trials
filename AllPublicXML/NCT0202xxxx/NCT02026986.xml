  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tear film consists of three layers including outer lipid layer, aqueous layer and inner mucin
      layer.1,2 Lipid layer protects the aqueous layer of tear film from evaporation and mucin
      layer adhere the tear film to ocular surface. Aqueous layer, which is produced in lacrimal
      glands, is the most important in the health of ocular surface. Reduction of aqueous tear
      secretion results in the disruption of homeostasis at ocular surface and leads to dry eye
      syndrome.2 Dry eye syndrome is a common ocular surface disease associated with symptoms of
      eye discomfort, grittness and visual disturbance.1,2 Dry eye syndrome disrupts normal
      homeostasis at the ocular surface resulting in epithelial damage, epithelial cell apoptosis,
      loss of goblet cells, and squamous metaplasia.1-3 The changes and inflammation of ocular
      surface subsequently lead to tear instability, which causes an increased tear osmolarity and
      aggravates the inflammatory cascades. This leads to a vicious cycle.2 The regulation of tear
      film secretion is under neural and hormonal control.4 Dry eye syndrome has been associated
      with diverse and multiple causes, including depressive disorder, drugs, hormonal status, and
      systemic diseases.2 Sleep deprivation (SD) is known to cause profound impair¬ments in
      executive function and vigilant attention.5,6 It is also reportedly associated with autonomic
      and endocrine functioning7-9 and has been shown to increase blood pressure and stress hormone
      levels and decrease parasympathetic tone.10,11 Tear secretion is regulated by neurological
      factors and hormones,12 and so SD may have an effect on the tear film and ocular surface.
      However, only a few studies have evaluated the effect of sleep on the tear film and ocular
      surface.

      In this study, we investigated the effect of SD on the tear film and ocular surface.

    <description>A microcapillary glass tube (Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) was placed on the lower outer conjunctival sac. To avoid reflex tearing, the subjects were asked to direct their gaze supranasally. A total of 30 µL of tears was taken from the marginal tear strip. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min, supernatants were obtained and the samples were stored at -80 degree. Tear osmolarity was measured using a Multi-OSMETTE 2430 (Precision Systems Inc., Natick, MA, USA).</description>

    <description>Fluorescein was placed in the lower conjunctival sac using a fluorescein strip (HAAG-STREIT, Köniz, Switzerland), and the time between the last blink and the first appearance of a dark spot was measured using the cobalt blue light of a slit lamp.

    <description>One drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride (Alcaine, Alcon, Forth Worth, TX, USA) was instilled in the conjunctival sac for topical anesthesia. In a silent room, filter paper (Color Bar, EagleVision, Memphis, TN, USA) was placed in the inferolateral one-third of the lower lid. Care was taken to prevent the paper from contacting the cornea. After 5 minutes, the level of strip wetting (in millimeters) was measured.</description>
