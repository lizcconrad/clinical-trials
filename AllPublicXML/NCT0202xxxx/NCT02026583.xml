      1. Study Objectives 1) Primary Objective: Progression-free survival 2) Secondary
           Objectives:

             1. overall survival

             2. response rate

             3. incidence, nature and severity of all adverse events

             4. lipid lowering effect of simvastatin

             5. exploratory biomarker analysis : angiopoietin 2, BiP (Binding protein), Hsp (Heat
                shck protein) 90α

        2. Study hypothesis In our recent in vitro study, addition of simvastatin to bevacizumab
           reduced proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation of endothelial cell.
           Moreover, colorectal cancer cell media which was treated with simvastatin combined with
           bevacizumab inhibited endothelial cell invasion and it was associated with decreased
           mediator of angiogenesis, such as angiopoietin 2, BiP and HSP 90α.. Treatment with
           bevacizumab and simvastatin more reduced the growth of xenograft tumors compared with
           bevacizumab alone.

        3. Assessments 1) Safety : physical examination, vital signs, body weight, ECOG (Eastern
           Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, clinical laboratory evaluation
           (chemistry, blood cell count) and any AE (adverse effect) graded by using CTCAE (Common
           Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects ) v 4.0 2) Efficacy : progression-free survival
           and overall survival will be collected. Response rate according to RECIST (Response
           Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1,1 guideline will also be evaluated 3) PFS
           (Progression free survival): time from randomization to tumor progression or death 4) OS
           (Overall survival) : time from randomization to death or last follow-up 5) Biomarker
           analysis; The correlation between blood level, protein expression of angiopoietin 2,
           BiP, Hsp90α and clinical response will be explored.
