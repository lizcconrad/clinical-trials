      This VISION study aims to investigate the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis using 68Ga-
      DOTATATE PET, and to validate 68Ga-DOTATATE PET imaging for the detection and quantification
      of vascular inflammation in the aorta, coronary and carotid arteries. This study will test
      the hypothesis that in subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic plaques,
      there will be a positive correlation between carotid artery 68Ga-DOTATATE PET signal and the
      underlying degree of carotid inflammation measured by immunohistochemical analysis.

    <textblock>
      Clinical events in atherosclerosis are largely driven by inflammation. Molecular imaging of
      atherosclerosis can potentially identify high-risk lesions, help guide treatment and
      illuminate the underlying biology of the disease. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET is the
      gold-standard nuclear molecular imaging technique with well-established roles in
      atherosclerosis imaging. However, the arterial 18F-FDG signal is non-specific, although it is
      related to increased macrophage activity with contributions from hypoxia and angiogenesis.
      Coronary artery imaging with 18F-FDG is particularly difficult, mainly due to high background
      myocardial cell 18F-FDG uptake, which obscures interpretation of the coronary signal. Efforts
      to suppress myocardial 18F-FDG uptake with dietary manipulation are challenging for patients
      and have limited efficacy.

      PET tracers currently used in cancer imaging, such as 68Ga-DOTATATE, are potentially more
      specific for inflammation and also lack myocardial muscle uptake. 68Ga-DOTATATE might
      therefore be better suited than 18F-FDG for imaging inflammation, particularly within the
      coronary arteries. The VISION study is a prospective, observational study designed to
      investigate the biology of plaque inflammation in atherosclerosis, using PET imaging with the
      somatostatin receptor ligand 68Ga-DOTATATE. 50 subjects with atherosclerosis will undergo
      sequential PET/CT imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE and 18F-FDG, along with contrast angiography of
      the carotid and coronary arteries. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of excised
      carotid plaques will be used to validate the imaging data. If successful, 68Ga-DOTATATE
      imaging will offer a cheaper, more specific non-invasive measure of inflammation than 18F-
      FDG, particularly in the coronary arteries. This opens up the possibility of better risk
      stratification for patients with atherosclerosis and could provide a non-invasive platform to
      test the effects of novel anti-atherosclerosis drugs.

        The study will recruit participants with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke due to
        carotid artery disease, from which they have made a good functional recovery. A proportion
        of these patients will undergo carotid endarterectmy as part of clinical management. We
        will also recruit participants with asymptomatic carotid atheroma, and those with stable
        coronary artery disease or recent acute coronary syndrome.
