  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the functionality of IMMAGES , an intravenous infusion device system,
      in patients hospitalized in Bait Balev hospital. The study will aim to determine how the
      IMMAGES system integrates within IV infusion therapy regime and what are the advantages and
      disadvantages, if any, of using this system within the prescribed setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using the IMMAGES system in patients recieving IV therapy will provide the nursing teams
      on-line information regarding the infusions and will allow them to monitor and manage the
      treatments in real-time, providing better and safer care for the patients.

    <measure>Successful operation of IMMAGES defined by patient receiving the prescribed IV medication using the IMMAGES system , openning of the controller valve including using the smartphone application and the management software</measure>

    <measure>- Detection of medical errors by IMMAGES</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 minutes from activating the controller on the IV line</time_frame>
    <description>If there is an error related to administration of wrong drug. to the wrong patient , on the wrong timing - the valve of the controller will not open , and the IV line will stay closed, and the patient will not get the wrong drug.</description>
