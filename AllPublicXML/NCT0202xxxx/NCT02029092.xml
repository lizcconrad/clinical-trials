      This registry is a clinical evaluation of the Orsiro LESS in subjects requiring coronary
      revascularization with Drug Eluting Stents (DES). It is designed to investigate and collect
      clinical evidence for the clinical performance and safety of the Orsiro Drug Eluting Stent
      System in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the majority of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) treatment with Percutaneous Transluminal
      Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) provides high initial procedure success. However, the medium to
      long-term complications range from rather immediate elastic coil or vessel contraction to
      longer processes like smooth muscle cell proliferation and excessive production of extra
      cellular matrix, thrombus formation and atherosclerotic changes like restenosis or
      angiographic re-narrowing. The reported incidence of restenosis after PTCA ranges from 30 to
      50%. Such rates of recurrence have serious economic consequences. Bare Metal Stents (BMS),
      designed to address the limitations of PTCA, reduced the angiographic and clinical restenosis
      rates in De Novo lesions compared to PTCA alone and decreased the need for CABG. BMS
      substantially reduced the incidence of abrupt artery closure, but restenosis still occurred
      in about 20 to 40% of cases, necessitating repeat procedures.

      The invention of Drug Eluting Stents (DES) significantly improved on the principle of BMS by
      adding an antiproliferative drug (directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from
      a polymer matrix), which inhibits neontimal hyperplasia. The introduction of DES greatly
      reduced the incidence of restenosis and resulted in better safety profile as compared to BMS
      with systemic drug administration. These advantages and a lower cost compared to surgical
      interventions has made DES an attractive option to treat coronary artery disease.

      Therefore this observational registry has been designed for the clinical evaluation of the
      ORSIRO LESS requiring coronary revascularization with DES. Results will contribute to the
      collection of clinical evidence for the clinical performance and safety of ORSIRO drug
      eluting stent system in daily clinical practice.
