      Check your health is a prevention intervention designed to create awareness and action on
      health condition with focus at physical activity at a population-level to 30-49 years of age.
      It consists of a behavioural and clinical examination followed by either (I) referral to a
      health promoting consultation in general practice (II) targeted behavioural programmes at the
      local Health Centre or (III ) no need for follow-up; stratified after risk-profile. The CORE
      trial (Check your health) aim to investigate effectiveness on health and social outcomes of
      the preventive health check and to establish the cost-effectiveness according to life years
      gained; direct costs and total health costs. A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial
      has been established to meet the aims and in total 10.600 individuals from 35 practices have
      been randomized in to two groups that will be invited in 2013-14 and 2017-18 respectively.
      The group offered the preventive health check in 2013-14 will constitute the intervention
      group and the group examined in 2017 - 18 the control group. A follow up of the intervention
      group in 2017 - 18 will provide data for the intention to treat analysis revealing the
      effect. Outcome measures are level of physical activity, risk of getting cardiovascular
      disease, sick leave and labor market attachment.

    <description>The program includes four components:
Invitation: All participants receive invitation by mail and a prefixed appointment time. A web-based questionnaire including self-reported health (SF12), physical activity, smoking habits and alcohol use/behaviour has to be answered before Health Examination (HE).
The HE include: Blood pressure, waist, weight, lung function test, lipid profile, HbA1c and fitness (Aastrand).
Health profile pamphlet: The participant receives a pamphlet with the results. The persons are stratified into three groups (I) referral to a consultation in general practice (GP) (II) targeted behavioural programs at the health centre (HC) or (III ) no identified need for health promoting follow-up.
Follow-up according to risk-profile: If referred to GP treatment of risk conditions or diseases will follow national guidelines. The GPs were paid 50 Euros per health interview.</description>
