  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to demonstrate that the use of music therapy may make
      it possible to discontinue at least one of neuroleptic treatment in patients with AD or
      related symptoms complicated by behavioral disorders such as agitation and aggressiveness
      evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).

      The study hypothesis is that music therapy may have a positive impact on patients with AD
      complicated by behavioral disorders by reducing the intensity of oppositional behaviour and
      aggressiveness and allowing a diminution of neuroleptic treatment.

    <textblock>
      A technique of receptive music therapy to induce relaxation has been developed in the
      university hospital of Montpellier: the &quot;U&quot; sequence. The musical sequence lasts 20 minutes
      and is made up of several phases that progressively induce a relaxed state in the patient.
      This effect is obtained by modulating the rhythm of the music, the orchestral formation,
      frequencies and volume. The phase of maximum relaxation is followed by a stimulating phase.
      These musical sequences have been specially designed by the music publishers Music Care©.
