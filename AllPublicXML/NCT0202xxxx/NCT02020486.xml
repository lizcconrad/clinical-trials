      This study will consist of 2 phases: Pretreatment Phase and Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment
      Phase will have 2 time points: Screening and Baseline. Subjects will be admitted to the
      clinical study ward the day before starting the study drug administration (Day -1) for PK and
      safety assessments during Treatment Phase, and discharged at Day 33 (group A) and Day 47
      (group B). Post-test will be done at Day 37 (+/-1), Day 42 (+3) (group A) and Day 51 (+/-1),
      Day 56 (+3) (group B). Study medication will be administered with 240 mL of room temperature
      water

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be included in the study:

          1. Korean healthy adult male volunteers

          2. Non-smoking, male subjects aged at least 19 years and no more than 55 years old at the
             time of informed consent

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than 18 and less than or equal to 30 kg/m2 at
             Screening. Note: BMI (kg/m2) = body weight (kg)/[height (m) x height (m)]

          4. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners are not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective
             contraception throughout the study period and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. No sperm donation is allowed during the study period and for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation

          5. Provide written informed consent

          6. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria
