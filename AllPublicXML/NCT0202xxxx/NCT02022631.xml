  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a parallel two-armed, non-inferiority randomized trial
      comparing new alternative formats of summary of findings tables (SoF) tables with current
      formats. The investigators will contact Cochrane review users by email and will ask them to
      fill a questionnaire developed using the &quot;Survey Monkey&quot; online system. The survey will
      include questions about baseline information (demographic characteristics, background, number
      of visits to the Cochrane Library, familiarity with the GRADE system, etc.). Then,
      participants will be stratified (health professional, guideline developer, researcher) and
      randomly assigned to one of the two SoF table formats, either the alternative (Table A) or
      the current one (Table C). Participants will be asked to answer questions to determine
      understanding, accessibility, and satisfaction with the formats to which they were
      randomized. Finally, the investigators will show them the table format to which they were not
      initially allocated in order to test their preference for either one.

    <measure>Understanding of key findings</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will frame multiple-choice questions about key concepts in the table with five response alternatives for each question and only one correct answer. Then, investigators will compare the proportion of correct answers between groups per question</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accessibility of information</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will consider 3 domains: (1) how easy is to find critical information in the table, (2) how easy is to understand the information, and (3) whether the information is presented in a way that is helpful for decision-making. These three domains will be measured presenting to participants three statements to which they have to indicate the degree of agreement: &quot;It was easy to find the information about the effects&quot;, &quot;It was easy to understand the information&quot;, and &quot;The information is presented in a way that would help me make a decision&quot; using a 7-point Likert scale (1= I strongly disagree, 2= I disagree, 3= I somewhat disagree, 4= Not sure, 5= I somewhat agree, 6= I agree, and 7= I strongly agree). The outcome overall accessibility of information will be obtained as the average of responses for each domain, per participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured using a 7-point Likert scale with 3 anchors: 1= strongly dissatisfied, 4= neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 7= strongly satisfied, and it will be treated as a continuous outcome. Investigators will compare the means per group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome taps the question: Between alternative (Table A) and current format (Table B) of SoF table, &quot;which table does the user prefer?&quot; It will be measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1= strongly prefer table B, 2= I prefer table B, 3= Both table A and B are good to me, 4= I prefer table A, 5= I strongly prefer table A), and it will be treated as continuous outcome. Investigators will describe the data obtained in each group. Other questions related to participants' preference for each alternative item will be included.</description>

    <description>Investigators will compare one SoF table with alternative formats (Table A) against one SoF table with the current formats (Table B). In both tables, the clinical question in terms of patients and setting, intervention, comparator, and outcomes informed by the tables, and the complementary information included as footnotes will be the same. The only differences between the current and alternative SoF table formats will be different methods to either show the same data in a different way or to provide complementary data to the one showed in the current format (i.e. supplementary data as risk difference).</description>
