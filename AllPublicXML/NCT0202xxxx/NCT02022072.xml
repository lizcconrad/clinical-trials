  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in neuromuscular diseases. The aim of
      this research is to evaluate the thoracopulmonary recruitment by comparison of inspiratory
      vital capacity (VC ins)and inspiratory/expiratory vital capacity (VC ins-ex) with the vital
      capacity (VC) according to pathology and severity of pulmonary damage of patients with
      neuromuscular diseases. The methodology consists in realize VC by support of
      inspiratory/expiratory pressures, while the patient is passive and realizing a maximal
      inspiratory/expiratory effort simultaneously, with the aid of mechanical
      insufflation/exsufflation device (Cough Assist®). The evaluation will last for 30 minutes and
      the non-inclusion criteria are those for an insufflation. The study hypothesis is that long
      term insufflation/exsufflation device use could improve thoracopulmonary mobility.
