      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence rate of infection in surgical patients
      with closed fractures treated prophylactically with Cefazolin versus Vancomycin in the
      peri-operative period.

      The hypothesis of this study is that patients undergoing surgical treatment for closed
      fractures who are treated prophylactically with Vancomycin will have a lower incidence rate
      of infection than patients who are treated prophylactically with Cefazolin.
