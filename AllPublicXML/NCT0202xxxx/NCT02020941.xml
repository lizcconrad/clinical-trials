    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib works in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma in first relapse or refractory to first-line therapy. Carfilzomib may stop the growth
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate of carfilzomib after 8 cycles of treatment in patients
      with first-relapsed myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate to single agent carfilzomib after 4 cycles of
      treatment.

      II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP). IV.
      To assess duration of response (DOR). V. To assess toxicities.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of carfilzomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone on the
      following biologic end points and their correlation with response: measurements of bone
      remodeling (sodium fluoride F 18 positron emission tomography [PET], serum markers of bone
      remodeling and the bone marrow osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation and function)
      with the measurement of disease response and proteasome activity in the bone marrow
      microenvironment.

      II. To describe recapture of response after progression in the maintenance phase.

      OUTLINE:

      TREATMENT PHASE (COURSES 1-8): Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than partial
      response (PR) also receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV weekly in courses 4-8.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1,
      2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to receive
      dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple myeloma (MM) in first relapse or refractory to first line therapy; the
             previous line of therapy should include either an immunomodulatory agent or a
             proteasome inhibitor

               -  Refractory disease is defined as =&lt; 25% response or progression during therapy or
                  within 60 days after completion

               -  The number of prior lines of anti-myeloma therapy will be determined as follows:

                    -  Induction chemotherapy for peripheral-blood stem cell harvest followed by
                       planned mobilization and subsequent high-dose chemotherapy with autologous
                       stem cell transplant (ASCT) is considered one therapy regardless of the
                       induction regimen

                    -  Planned maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation or other
                       induction therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy, as long as
                       there is no evidence of progression in the time between the induction or
                       transplantation and the initiation of maintenance therapy

                    -  Two ASCTs within 6 months of each other is considered as one line unless
                       different agents were used in the high-dose therapy-conditioning regimens

                    -  If the same regimen is repeated after a 6-month interval, they are

                    -  If cyclophosphamide is used for reasons other than planned stem cell
                       mobilization, its use is considered to be a separate line of therapy

                    -  Dose modification of steroid and altering choices of steroid (i.e. from
                       dexamethasone to prednisone) due to side effects, is not considered a line
                       of therapy, as long as there is no evidence of progression

                    -  If a regimen was stopped for more than 2 months, its re-initiation is
                       counted as another line of therapy

          <description>TREATMENT PHASE (COURSES 1-8): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than PR also receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly in courses 4-8.
MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than PR also receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly in courses 4-8.
MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
