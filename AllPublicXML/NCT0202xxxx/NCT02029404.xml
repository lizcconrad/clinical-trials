  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll patients submitted to feet elective orthopaedic surgery that require analgesia
      through continuous peripheral nerve block (CNPB) of the sciatic nerve. All catheters will be
      placed by anaesthesiologists experienced in ultrasound in prone positioning. The patients
      will be randomized in two groups with technique of sealed envelopes.

      In the tibial -peroneal nerve (TPN) group we will position the catheter within the confluence
      of peroneal and tibial nerve.

      In the tibial nerve (TN) group we will proceed , previous local anaesthesia, to insert a
      catheter medially to tibial branch of the sciatic nerve according to in plane approach.

      We will analyze A: the difference in consumption of local anesthetic in the two different
      groups B: the difference of &quot;insensate limb&quot; in the post-operative home as described by
      Ilfeld(inability to perceive the sense of touch throughout the area of distribution of the
      sciatic nerve) C: rate of foot drop D: numeric rate scale (NRS) for pain assessment, rate of
      dislodgment of the catheters, patient satisfaction, need for intervention by the
      anesthesiologist after discharge.

    <description>In the TN (tibial nerve ) group probe will be placed in popliteal cave to identify the popliteal artery and laterally the tibial nerve. Identified the tibial nerve we will proceed , previous local anaesthesia, to insert a catheter medially to tibial branch of the sciatic nerve according to in plane approach.</description>

    <description>In the TPN (tibial -peroneal nerve) group the probe will be placed in popliteal cave to identify the popliteal artery and laterally the tibial nerve. Afterwards, proceeding cranially with the probe according to &quot;in plane&quot; approach, we will identify the confluence of tibial with peroneal branch and in this point, previous local anaesthesia, we will position the catheter within the confluence of peroneal and tibial nerve.</description>

    <description>After the recovery of the sensitivity we will start the continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0,125% with a portable pump (Mini Rythmic Evolution, Micrel Medical Devices) with a flow basal rate 2 ml/h and a rescue bolus doses of 2 ml (lock out 20 minutes). Before the discharge from the hospital, if the NRS will be &gt; 4, a bolus of 10 ml of Mepivacaine 1% through the catheter could be administered.
An &quot;information sheet&quot; will be released at the discharge and the medical indication for any &quot;rescue doses&quot; at home.
The patients will be contacted by phone at POD 1-2 and will allowed to answer to a questionnaire (see endpoint) At POD 3 the patients will come in our ambulatory where we will remove the catheter and they will return the pump</description>
