      1. Background:

           Preliminary studies have suggested that valproate acid (VPA) may promote neuron
           survival, inhibit apoptosis, decrease the neuron function deficit in cerebral ischemia,
           and promote the brain functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Besides,
           in the guide of prevention and treatment of epilepsy in 2007, VPA was one of the
           antiepileptic drugs which were suggested to prevent early epilepsy after TBI (less than
           7 days).

        2. Objectives:

           Our main objective was to evaluate whether VPA could protect brain and improve recovery
           of brain function after severe TBI. The secondary objective was to explore whether VPA
           could prevent late epilepsy after severe TBI (more than 7 days).

        3. Methods:

      We would enroll 160 patients who were in a vegetative or minimally conscious state 4 to 16
      weeks after TBI and who were receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Patients were randomly
      assigned to receive VPA or placebo for 4 weeks and were followed for 2 weeks after the
      treatment was discontinued. The rate of functional recovery on the Disability Rating Scale
      (DRS; range, 0 to 29, with higher scores indicating greater disability) was compared over the
      4 weeks of treatment (primary outcome) and during the 2-week washout period with the use of
      mixed-effects regression models.

    <description>The patients began receiving treatment at a dose of 400 mg VPA twice daily on the day after randomization by intravenous drip, with this dose continued for 14 days.The dose was increased to 500 mg twice daily at week 3 and to 400 mg three times daily at week 4 if the DRS score had not improved by at least 2 points from baseline. After the week 4 assessment, the study drug was tapered over a period of 2 to 3 days, with assessment of the patients continued through week 6.
