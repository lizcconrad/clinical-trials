  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer remains a public health burden, particularly in developing countries such as
      sub-saharan Africa where the infrastructure for organized screening programs does not exist.
      As a result, other screening modalities (visual inspection with acetic acid) are the standard
      of care in such regions. It is now known, persistent infection with an oncogenic Human
      papillomavirus (HPV) type is a necessary precursor of cervical cancer and evidence is showing
      HPV testing is a potential, safe and effective alternative to cytology testing (The Pap
      smear). This study is evaluating the feasibility and acceptance of HPV self-collection vs.
      VIA in a cohort of women from Kisenyi, Uganda.

    <description>Standard of care in Uganda is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Women randomized to this arm will undergo the following: Cervix examined by clinician using speculum and light source. Cervix then sprayed with 3-5% acetic acid, and then lesions described one minute after application of acetic acid. VIA negative no acetowhite lesions detected; positive is when dense aceto-white lesions are seen touching squamocolumnar junction</description>
