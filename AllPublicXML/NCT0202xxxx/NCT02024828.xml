    <description>Infants were offered oral feedings beginning at 32 weeks PMA. They were offered 2 oral feedings per day for 3 days (Days 1-3). The number of oral feedings offered per day increased by 1 feeding every other day until day 14 when they were offered 8 oral feedings each day (Days 4-5, 3 oral feeds offered; Days 6-7, 4 oral feeds offered; Days 8-9, 5 oral feeds offered; Days 10-11, 6 oral feeds offered; Days 12-13, 7 oral feeds offered; Day14, 8 oral feeds offered). Any feedings not offered orally were provided by gavage.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) the infant's gestational age at birth was less than 32 weeks; 2) the infant was
             receiving enteral feedings every three hours; 3) the infant was able medically to feed
             orally by 32 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA); and 3) the parents gave consent for the
             infant's participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) they were unable to begin oral feeding at 32 weeks PMA due to gastrointestinal,
             craniofacial, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and/or genetic defects; 2) had surgical
             necrotizing enterocolitis; or 3) needed ventilator support, including nasal continuous
             positive airway pressure (CPAP), beyond 32 weeks PMA. Infants receiving oxygen by
             cannula were included.
