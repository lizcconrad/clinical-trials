      Study Hypothesis Enhancement of Th-1 response with the help of a poly TLR agonist (Mw) is
      likely to increase survival in patients with severe sepsis.

      Objectives To study whether immunomodulation with Mycobacterium Mw helps in improving
      survival and the recovery of organ function in patients with severe sepsis. This will be
      assessed with the help of the following

        -  Mortality in the two arms

        -  Daily SOFA scores

        -  Ventilator free days

        -  Time-to-vasopressor withdrawal

        -  ICU length of stay

        -  Hospital length of stay METHODS This will be a proof of the concept study to assess the
           effect of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard therapy versus standard therapy
           alone on the inflammatory profile in sepsis due to gram negative infection. A total of
           25 patients will be enrolled in each group. The patients will be randomized in balance
           to receive either test drug or its placebo along with the standard of care

      This will be a proof of the concept study to assess the effect of Mycobacterium w in
      combination with standard therapy versus standard therapy alone on the inflammatory profile
      in sepsis due to gram negative infection. The study will be conducted in the respiratory
      intensive care unit at PGIMER, Chandigarh, over a period of 1 year. A total of 25 patients
      will be enrolled in each group. The patients will be randomized in balance to receive either
      test drug or its placebo along with the standard of care

      In addition to the standard therapy for sepsis, patients randomized to test arm will receive
      single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw intra-dermal for 3 consecutive days while patients
      randomized to control arm will receive single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw-placebo intra-dermal
      for 3 consecutive days.

      Study Duration Study duration for each patient will be 28 days. Follow up period is included
      in the study duration of 28 days

      Study Outlines and Timing of Visits Eligible patients will be enrolled after due consent and
      randomized to one of the treatment arms. The enrolled patients will be monitored for any
      adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period. All
      patients will continue to receive standard therapy till considered requisite
