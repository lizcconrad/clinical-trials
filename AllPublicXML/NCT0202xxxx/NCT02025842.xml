      To evaluate the impact of liver fibrosis and other variables [e.g., age, sex, virological
      response (VR), and previous resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NUC) therapy] on
      Hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in an Italian population of genotype D HBeAg-negative CHB
      patients treated with long-term NUC therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually develops in patients with chronic liver disease,
      particularly patients with liver cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is one of the most
      frequent underlying causes of HCC. Several studies have demonstrated that variations in the
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype have different effects on HCC. HBV genotypes C and D had
      lower responses to interferon-based therapy and higher frequencies of basal core promoter
      mutations than genotypes A and B.For this reason, HBV genotypes C and D seem to lead to more
      severe liver disease, including cirrhosis, compared with the other HBV genotypes. Because
      liver cirrhosis is one of the strongest HCC risk factors in CHB patients, antiviral therapy
      may prevent the development of liver complications such as HCC. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the impact of liver fibrosis and other variables, such as age, sex, virological
      response (VR), and resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NUC) therapy, in a
      population of genotype D HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with long-term NUC therapy.

        From January 2000 to December 2013, 745 HBV-infected patients were included in the
        database. Of these, 438 were excluded: 226 did not fulfil the diagnosis of CHB, 75 had
        HBeAg-positive CHB, 20 had received NUC for &lt;18 months, 26 had HCC diagnosed before or
        within the first 18 months of therapy, and 61 presented a different HBV genotype. Thirty
        patients had decompensated cirrhosis. A total of 306 HBeAg-negative genotype D patients
        were selected and included in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only chronic hepatitis B or compensated cirrhosis HBeAg-negative genotype D patients
             were included in this study.The patients were included in this study if they were â‰¥18
             years old and had received treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide for a period of at
             least 18 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed before or during the first 18 months
             of nucleoside/nucleotide therapy, as well as patients coinfected with hepatitis D,
             hepatitis C, or HIV, were excluded. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were
             excluded because of the low number of cases observed.
