    <textblock>
      Retrospective evaluation on the effect of splenic irradiation on clinical and hematological
      response and toxicity in patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with CLL treated with splenic irradiation in Maastro Clinic,
      Maastricht, The Netherlands, Maxima Medisch Centrum Veldhoven/Catharina hospital, Eindhoven,
      The Netherlands and Modena hospital, Modena, Italy. Data will be collected from patient
      records in an uniform database. Data will include demographic data, CLL stadium (RAI and
      Binet) at diagnosis and at the time of irradiation treatment, clinical data at diagnosis
      (haematology), splenic irradiation data, follow-up data such as date of progression or death
