  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase Ib/II study, which is composed of a
      phase Ib dose escalation part and a phase II dose expansion part. Patients will receive
      selumetinib in combination with gefitinib 250mg daily. This study will enroll EGFR-mutated
      NSCLC patients who have developed acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment.

    <textblock>
      he primary objective of the dose escalation part is to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of
      selumetinib in combination with gefinitib. Once MTD and/or RP2D has been determined in the
      phase Ib dose escalation phase, study drug selumetinib with combination of 250mg QD dose of
      gefitinib will be further evaluated in a phase II dose expansion phase of the study. The
      purpose of the dose expansion phase is to evaluate the efficacy of selumetinib in combination
      of gefitinib and to further characterize the safety, and tolerability of the combination.

      20 patients will be required in the phase II period. In the expansion phase, 10 patients with
      T790M and 10 patients without T790M will be enrolled. It is assumed that 20% response rate is
      the target of clinical interest. If the true response rate is 20%, the probability of
      observing no responses in a random sample of 10 patients is 0.107. The false negative rate
      for detecting a true 20% response rate in each cohort is approximately 10%. Each cohort will
      be enrolled 10 patients to evaluate the efficacy; therefore 20 patients will be enrolled in
      dose expansion part. Patients treated at the MTD and/or RP2D during the phase Ib will be
      considered as part of the required number of patients in the phase II. Patients at the MTD or
      RP2D cannot contribute to the 20 patients require for phase II part.

             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the

             period. A condom is required to be used also by a vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

             21. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g. infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow medication, social/psychological issues, etc.
