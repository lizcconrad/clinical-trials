  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REDUCE-HTN-China study is a prospective, multi-center, single cohort study for the
      percutaneous therapeutic treatment of medication-resistant hypertension in China.The primary
      objective is to assess the efficacy performance of the Vessix™ Renal Denervation System for
      the treatment of medication resistant hypertension on the basis of the hypothesis that the
      percutaneous therapeutic renal denervation for the treatment of medication-resistant
      hypertension using the Vessix™ Renal Denervation System will reduce systolic (SBP) and
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 6- month compared to baseline as accessed by office-based
      blood pressure measurements.

      The Vessix System is a highly-differentiated and advanced renal denervation system that
      features an intuitive push-button interface, a short 30-second treatment time and an
      over-the-wire, balloon-based approach familiar to most cardiac and vascular specialists. The
      Vessix System has both CE Mark and TGA approval and is currently available for sale in
      Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and selected markets in Asia. The Vessix
      System is an investigational device and not available for sale in China. An current analysis
      of the REDUCE-HTN post market study affirms the device's safety profile and effective
      treatment for resistant hypertension.
