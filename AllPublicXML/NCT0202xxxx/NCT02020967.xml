      The primary objective of the protocol is to define percentage of patients with acromegaly in
      relation to the total number of screened patients with confirmed clinically significant set
      of associated somatic disorders with the help of laboratory (Insulin-like Growth Factor I,
      Growth Hormone, Oral Glucose-Tolerance Test [IGF-1, GH, OGTT]) and instrumental examination
      methods (Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI]).
