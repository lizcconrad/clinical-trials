      Hypothesis: Elevated miR210 in the epidermis (outer layer of skin) of ischemic human wound
      edge tissue (tissue that has a lack of blood flow to it) is associated with poor healing
      outcome in a setting of standard clinical care.

      Aim of the study: To determine whether elevated miR-210 in the epidermis of ischemic human
      wound edge tissue is associated with poor healing outcome in a setting of standard clinical
      care.

      This study will last 14 weeks. Adult patients, who are non-diabetic or tightly controlled
      diabetic, and, who have chronic venous leg ulcers, that are not infected and have been
      open/not healed for at least 12 weeks, will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be
      recruited from the OSU Wexner Medical Center Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC). On days 0, 14
      and 28, patients will have the following performed: measurements and photographs taken of
      their wound; TCOM (transcutaneous oxygen measurement) or ABI to measure the amount of oxygen
      in the wound tissue; and two 3-mm punch biopsies from the same wound/ulcer. Biopsies will not
      be taken if the wound has closed by day 14 or day 28. Additionally, patients' medical records
      will be reviewed throughout the study to obtain information about the patient (age, sex,
      race/ethnicity, current medications, TCOM, would location and type, other illness/diagnoses,
      wound care treatment and instructions, nutritional status based on albumin levels), and at 14
      weeks after enrollment to determine the final status of the wound (healed or not healed).

      There will be a total of 5 visits for this study (6 total visits for patients with open
      wounds on day 28 of the study). Visits will occur on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as 28-day prospective longitudinal observational study including a 98
      day (14 week) follow-up photography of the wound to test whether wounds open on day 28 have
      closed on week 14, or if they have remained chronically open.

      On days 0, 14 and 28 after enrollment, wound images will be obtained. Wound photographs are a
      part of standard care when patients come to the Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC). Images do
      not include the part of body that could lead to identification of the participants. In
      addition, following standard of care, two biopsies will be taken - one biopsy will be used
      for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and immunohistochemistry studies, while the other
      will be used for determination of infection status using quantitative bacterial cultures and
      Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging for biofilm phenotyping.

      The following will be completed on days 0, 14 and 28:

        1. Wound measurements - Photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area.

        2. Two Wound-edge biopsies (3mm) - following wound bed preparation with 1% lidocaine local
           anesthetic, as required, two punch biopsies (3 mm each) will be obtained from the
           wound-edge (the leading 3mm edge of the skin at the perimeter) of the same wound/ulcer.

        3. Data Collection - the following information will be collected during the enrollment
           visit and updated at each visit (weekly - on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 98 (week 14) ),
           as necessary, and entered onto the data collection form: Age; Sex; Race/Ethnicity;
           Current medications; Transcutaneous oxygen measurement(TCOM) &lt;30 mmHg or ABI &lt; 0.8;
           Wound location &amp; Etiology; Other associated illnesses; Wound care modality/treatment;
           and Nutritional status will be recorded as documented by albumin levels and chart
           records.

      Healing outcome: Wound photography will be performed every 7 days (every week) as a part of
      the current standard of care. Based on wound measurements from days 0 and 28 , patients will
      be classified as either healing or non-healing, per criteria described in the study
      proposal/protocol.

      There will be a total of 5 visits for this study (6 total visits for patients with open
      wounds on day 28 of the study). Visits will occur on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28.

    <description>Patients visiting the OSU Wexner Medical Center Comprehensive Wound Center, with a choronic venous leg ulcer(s), who qualify based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be involved in a 14-week (98 days) longitudinal observational study. All subjects in this arm will have wound measurements, photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, and two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies of the same wound/ulcer (for OCT &amp; infection) on days day 0, 14, and 28. Biopsies will not be taken if the wound has closed by day 14 or 28. Patient charts will be reviewed 98 days (14 weeks) after enrollment to determine the final status of the wound as healed or not-healed.</description>
