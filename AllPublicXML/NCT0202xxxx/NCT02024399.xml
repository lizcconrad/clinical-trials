  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will address the important area of childhood obesity and the risk of
      cardiovascular disease associated with obesity. This is a serious health concern since
      children who are overweight or obese are prone to other medical conditions including high
      blood pressure, abnormal lipid profiles,and type 2 diabetes. Although exercise and nutrition
      programs are recommended, evidence for the efficacy of these programs in improving
      cardiovascular health is lacking.

      Specific Aims: a) improve cardiovascular risk factors, b) increase physical fitness levels,
      c) improve lean body mass, d) enhance QOL of the child e) influence adherence rates to
      exercise and a healthy lifestyle change both during and beyond the conclusion of the program.

      Hypothesis 1a: Compared to baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week
      multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program will show significant improved levels of
      cardiovascular risk factors.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when
      compared with a matched, WLC group will show a change in whole body assessment including a
      decrease in fat mass, an increase in percent lean body mass, and a decrease in percent body
      fat, as measured utilizing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Hypothesis 2a: Compared to
      baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness and
      nutrition program will show improved whole body assessments including.

      Specific Aim 3:To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when
      compared with a WLC group will show improved levels of fitness. Hypothesis 3a: Compared to
      baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness and
      nutrition program will show significant improvements in fitness including.
