      A randomized double blind clinical trial to assess efficacy of leflunomide in treatment of
      refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

      Patients are randomly divided into two groups. In group 1 leflunomide and in group 2 placebos
      will be added to conventional treatment for three months. therapeutic responses will be
      evaluated by ACRpedi (American College of Rheumatology Pediatric) scores every 4 weeks.

      30 Patients(2-19 y) are randomly divided into two groups. In group 1 leflunomide will be
      added to conventional treatment, 5-20 mg daily based on weight.

      In group 2 placebo will be prescribed as same as leflunomide. The course of treatment is 3
      months. Every 4 weeks ACRped 30, 50, 70 should be determined to evaluate therapeutic
      response. Side effects of treatment will be assessed by physical examination and lab tests
      every 4 weeks.
