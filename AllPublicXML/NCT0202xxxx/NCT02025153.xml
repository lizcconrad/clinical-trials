      To determine whether central sensitization is a mechanism of CPSP (chronic postsurgical pain)
      in women who will develop CPSP compared to women with no CPSP after hysterectomy. This
      mechanism is illustrated by a higher pain score in experimental pain models such as tonic
      heat stimulation, increased evoked mechanical temporal summation and increased wound
      hyperalgesia.

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects 9% of Singapore population resulting in major socioeconomic burden.
      Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) that persists for over 3 months could be related to nerve
      injury making this a strategic model to study the transition of acute to chronic pain. CPSP
      occurs in up to 50% after surgery and up to 32% after hysterectomy. Over 600000
      hysterectomies were performed in the US in 2003 making CPSP a significant problem.

      Investigators will perform this prospective cohort study to determine whether increased
      central sensitization and negative psychological experience are involved in the transition of
      acute to chronic pain after hysterectomy. Investigators will recruit 444 women undergoing
      hysterectomy and employ validated physical pain testing including tonic heat stimulation,
      mechanical temporal summation and wound hyperalgesia which had been shown to be related to
      central sensitization. Pain catastrophizing (negative thoughts of pain) and state trait
      anxiety scoring will be assessed for the impact of negative cognitive-affective experience on
      CPSP. A phone survey will be performed at 4 months to determine the primary outcome of CPSP.
      Arterial spin labeling will be used to delineate cerebral blood flow using arterial spin
      labeling, functional connectivity and structural connectivity to evaluate insula-anterior
      cingulate cortex differences in 30 women with CPSP compared to 30 women without CPSP.

      In addition to evaluating whether central sensitization, negative psychological experience
      and activation of brain regions are different in women with CPSP after hysterectomy, the
      results of this study will elucidate potential mechanisms of CPSP development that will guide
      in future studies on potential novel therapeutic targets.
