      The primary trial objective is to determine the efficacy of KPT-330 (selinexor) in patients
      with advanced or metastatic gynaecological cancers by disease control rate (complete response
      (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks, assessed
      according to RECIST 1.1 criteria).

      There are two different dosing schedules for ovarian cancer patients. Two additional
      treatment schedules will be explored in the ovarian cohort to optimize the dosing schedule in
      a patient population with ovarian carcinoma. Two parallel cohorts of patients with breast
      carcinoma will also be enrolled.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma: both platinum refractory and platinum
             resistant patients, who have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for relapsed disease
             (i.e., ≥2 lines of chemotherapy in total).

          -  Endometrial carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 line of chemotherapy for
             relapsed or advanced (stage IV, IIIc) disease.

          -  Cervical carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for relapsed
             or advanced (stage IVb) disease.

          -  Breast cancer: adenocarcinoma of the breast with metastatic or locally advanced
             disease not amenable to curative resection or any other curative treatment.

          -  Breast cancer: Patients must have received ≥ 1 line of endocrine treatment or
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease as applicable for the respective breast cancer
             subtype.

          -  Breast cancer: Patient must have either triple negative cancer or be hormone receptor
             positive (i.e., ER+ and/or PR+) and HER2 negative.

          -  Must have either measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) or evaluable disease outside
             irradiated field on CT/MRI. A rise in CA-125 or other tumor marker alone is not
             sufficient.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of complete or partial bowel obstruction.

          -  Gynecological cancer: All non-epithelial cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube,
             peritoneum, endometrium or cervix as well as neuro-endocrine tumors are excluded.

          -  Radiation (except planned or ongoing palliative radiation to bone outside of the
             region of measurable disease) ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1.

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy or systemic anticancer therapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1.
