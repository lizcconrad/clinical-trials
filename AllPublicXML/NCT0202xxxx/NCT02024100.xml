    <textblock>
      The study is to identify the effectiveness of Eprosartan on pulse pressure in hypertensive
      patients with metabolic syndrome

      -Definition of pulse pressure (PP): Difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      produced one heart beat.

      Primary Objective

      -To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 12 weeks

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 4, 24 weeks

        -  To assess the changes of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at each
           visit

        -  Percentage of responder rate* at each visit and time to get normalized BP from
           enrollment

        -  Responder rate at last visit

        -  To assess IIEF-5 (5-item Version of the International Index of Erectile Function) score
           at enrollment and 24 weeks (percentage of patients with ED according to IIEF-5, Changes
           of IIEF-5 domains)

        -  Percentage of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) according to IIEF-5 and changes of
           PP in subgroup (age 65, body mass index (BMI) 23, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
           benign prostate hypertrophy)

        -  Analysis of correlation between ED and concomitant disease and concomitant medications
           in patients who received Eprosartan

        -  Score changes of Framingham 10-year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk at 1st visit, 4th
           visit

        -  Percentages of Eprosartan monotherapy and multiple antihypertensive therapies at
           enrollment and last visit

        -  Reason for treatment discontinuation (Inadequate BP control, adverse events, others)

        -  Adverse events

             -  Responder rate: SBP &lt;140mmHg and DBP &lt;90mmHg (SBP &lt;140mmHg and DBP &lt;85mmHg for
                patients with diabetes mellitus)

Severity of erectile dysfunction will be presented a contingency table and symmetry testing will be done whether there is a significant difference in the data
As sub-analysis, type of study drug, age, BMI, with/without diabetes mellitus, with/without dyslipidemia, with/without benign prostate hypertrophy, type of treatment will be considered
For safety analysis, overall incidence rate of adverse event will be presented and frequency and percentage will be presented according to body organs and preferable terminology</description>
