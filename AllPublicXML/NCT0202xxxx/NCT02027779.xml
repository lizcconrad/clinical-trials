      This study primarily will address the safety and secondarily will assess efficacy of
      GreenGene™ F in subjects with severe hemophilia A previously treated ≥50 exposure days with a
      GreenGene™ F, and without presence inhibitor to FVIII (Factor VIII).

          3. Negative assays for FVIII inhibitor at inclusion (&lt;0.6BU Nijmegen assay), i.e. at the
             end of study &quot;GreenGene™ F_P3&quot; for patients entering into this extension study
             immediately after finishing the previous phase III study.
