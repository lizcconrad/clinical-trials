  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of sudden hearing loss is rising obviously resent year, Glucocorticoids have
      obtained obvious effect in the treatment of sudden deafness. Postauricular hypodermic
      injection is the latest findings in clinical work and a new noninvasive way of administration
      which is gradually expanding research. The aim of this experiment is to verify and explore
      the efficacy and safety of the postauricular injection treatment with different doses of
      Glucocorticoids.
