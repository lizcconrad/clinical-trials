      The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effectiveness of three different
      methods for posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The included
      methods are Modified Epley maneuver, Semont maneuver and Sham maneuver.

      This study was a prospective, double blinded, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. The
      enrolled posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients were
      randomized to one of the three treatment regimens when they are diagnosed with the
      Dix-Hallpike test. An then the patient was treated with one of the three maneuvers. After 20
      minutes, the patient was examined with the Dix-Hallpike test again. The resolution of
      nystagmus and symptoms were checked. When the nystagmus was sustained, the same treatment was
      applied once again. And after 20 minutes, the patient was examined with the Dix-Hallpike test
      too. 1 day after and 7 days after, the patient was re-examined with the Dix-Hallpike test.

    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The immediate effectiveness of treatment was determined by otolaryngologists with the Dix-Hallpike test 20 minutes after initial manerver applied. The investigator had no information of the treatment applied to the patient. The complete resolution means absence of nystagmus and paroxysmal vertigo symptom. If there was a sustained nystagmus, the latency and duration was measured.</description>

    <description>Ather 1 day and 7 days after the initial treatment was applied, the patients were re-visit the clinic and re-examined with the Dix-Hallpike test. The absence of nystagmus and vertigo was determinded.</description>

    <description>For Modified Epley maneuver, the patient was placed in the upright position with the head turned 45 degrees toward the affected ear. And then the patient was rapidly laid back to the supine head-hanging position for 1 minute. Next, the head was turned 90 degrees toward the other (unaffected) side for 1 minute. Next, the head is turned a further 90 degrees (usually necessitating the patient's body to also move from the supine position to the lateral decubitus position) such that the patient' head is nearly in the facedown position for 1 minute. The patient is then brought into the upright sitting position for 1 minute, completing the maneuver.</description>

    <description>Patient's head was turned 45 degrees toward the healthy side. And then patient was rapidly moved to affected side-lying position and sustained for 2 minutes. Next, Patient is rapidly taken to the opposite side-lying position without pausing in the sitting position or changing the head position relative to the shoulder for 2 minutes. Next, Patient returns slowly with the head still tilted and fixed until the seated position for 1 minute.</description>
