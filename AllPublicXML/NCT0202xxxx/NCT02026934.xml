  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CliniMACs is an investigational device used to select and enrich stem cells. The device will
      select the stem cells with CD34+ protein. The participant will be infused with the CD34+
      selected cells in the hopes that it will help the participant engraft. Engraftment is when
      transplanted stem cells resume production of healthy blood cells.

      -  After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate
           in the research study: If the participant takes part in this research study, the
           participant (and their donor) will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  Donor Graft Collection: The participant's cell donor will undergo stem cell collection.
           The cells collected will be sent to the laboratory for processing.

        -  Donor Graft Processing: In the laboratory the CliniMACS device will be used to separate
           the CD34+ stem cells from the other types of cells in the graft. After completing the
           necessary safety tests, the CD34+ selected donor graft will be ready for administration.

        -  Donor Graft Infusion: The CD34+ selected donor graft will be infused through an
           intravenous (I.V.) catheter. The day of this infusion is called Day 0.

        -  Follow-Up Visits: Approximately 3, 6 and 12 months after the donor graft infusion, the
           participant will return to clinic for follow-up visits. At each of the visits, the
           participant will have a physical exam and asked questions about your general health. The
           participant will also have routine blood tests performed (approximately 1 tablespoon of
           blood).

        -  At times more cells are collected from a donation than are needed to do the
           transplantation. If your physician determines that it is preferable to administer a dose
           of cells that is less than the complete collection, the extra cells may be frozen and
           stored in our freezers for the participant's future use. If the cell counts do not
           improve, the participant will be given the remaining cells through an intravenous (I.V.)
           catheter.

    <description>Following screening and enrollment, peripheral blood or bone marrow collection will be performed on the donor followed by subsequent CD34+ cell selection using the Miltenyi CliniMACS device. There is no limit to the number of CD34+ progenitors that can be administered. The CD34+ selected cells will be infused within 12 hours of the initiation of processing.</description>
