  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This comparison is made between the effects of sertindole and risperidone on vulnerability
      indicators in schizophrenia. More specifically: the effects of these two antipsychotic
      compounds on basic processing of incoming information is studied. The investigators expect
      that the newer antipsychotic sertindole to be more effective in restoring information
      processing in schizophrenia patients than risperidone.

      The study is has a so-called double blind, randomized - yet balanced - cross-over design, in
      which 24 male patients with schizophrenia are included. After inclusion in the study,
      patients will be assessed in a test-battery, in which psychophysiological parameters of their
      basic information capabilities are quantified. Following this, the patients will be treated
      with either risperidone or sertindole for a period of 10 weeks, after which they will
      cross-over to the other treatment (the order of treatments is randomized (and balanced)). The
      battery of tests is repeated after the first and second treatment period. In addition, a
      second test-battery will be performed at these follow-up intervals, to assess
      neuropsychological parameters of information processing. To evaluate the extend of the
      treatment effects, the patients will be matched (age, gender, parental socioeconomic status)
      to 24 healthy controls.
