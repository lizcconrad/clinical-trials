      This study aims to evaluate the effects of a mobile phone-based dietary and physical activity
      intervention on body fatness, dietary intake and physical activity of preschoolers

    <textblock>
      Childhood overweight and obesity is an increasing health problem globally, and can be
      established as early as 2-5 years of age. Mobile phone based (mHealth) interventions have
      been successful for weight management in adults; however, their potential in young children
      is yet to be established. Therefore, the ultimate goal of MINISTOP (Mobile-based INtervention
      Intended to STop Obesity in Preschoolers) trial is to help parents of four year old children
      to achieve a healthy weight and body fat via a smartphone app (MINISTOP). More specifically
      this trial aims to reduce body fat (primary outcome), increase the intake of fruits,
      vegetables as well as decrease the intake of candy, and sweetened beverages, and increase the
      amount of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and decrease sedentary
      behaviors (secondary outcomes) in healthy preschool aged Swedish children. If the MINISTOP
      app is effective, it has the potential to be incorporated into the child health care to aid
      in counteracting overweight and obesity.

    <description>The intervention in the present study is a web- and mobile phone based intervention aiming to develop healthy lifestyle behaviors regarding physical activity and dietary habits in 4-year-olds.

    <description>Parents in the intervention group receive a six month mHealth program (the MINISTOP app) based on social cognitive theory with strategies to change unhealthy diet and physical activity behaviors. The program includes information, advice, and strategies to change unhealty behaviours and the possibility to register the child's intake of fruits, vegetables, candy, sweetened beverages, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary time. Feedback is then provided on reported variables. In addition, the parents are able to ask questions through the app to a dietician and a psychologist.</description>
