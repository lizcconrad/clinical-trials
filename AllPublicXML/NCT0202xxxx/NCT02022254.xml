  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the
      influence of semaglutide on pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of warfarin and
      pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy subjects.
