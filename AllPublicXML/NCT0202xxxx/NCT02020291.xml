  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wnt proteins belong to a family of proteins that have been demonstrated to play a role in
      the formation and dissemination of tumours. The present project focuses on the critical role
      of the Wnt-5a protein in the pathobiological processes that lead to metastatic cancer
      disease.

      WntResearch has identified a formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment, named Foxy-5, which
      mimick the effects of Wnt-5a to impair migration of epithelial cancer cells and thereby
      acting anti-metastatic. The aim of the present clinical phase 1 trial is to establish the
      recommended dose for a clinical phase 2 study and thereby further develop Foxy-5 as a first
      in class anti-metastatic cancer drug. Foxy-5 is designed to inhibit the development of
      metastasis by reducing the motility of cancer cells and should thereby increase the survival
      rates of patients with solid malignant tumours.
