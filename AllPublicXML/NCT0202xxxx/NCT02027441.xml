      The purpose of this study is to gather information needed to develop a large prevention trial
      to decrease risk for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among HIV-discordant
      couples (where one person is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative) in Lesotho.

      The protocol team would like to explore new strategies for increasing the number of partners
      who receive an HIV test and whether this increase in testing also results in identifying
      HIV-discordant couples. These couples would be the focus of the future large prevention trial
      therefore it is critical that the protocol team explore effective strategies for identifying
      and recruiting these couples.

      Men and women (index participants) who are attending antenatal (ANC) and Tuberculosis (TB)
      clinics will be recruited for this study. If they agree to take part, a testing team will
      visit their household and offer all adults staying in the house the opportunity to receive an
      HIV test.

      Three hundred index participants will be enrolled into the study and have their homes visited
      by the testing team. The number of household members tested will depend on the number of
      people living in each household.

      In Lesotho, a country with estimated 16% discordance among heterosexual couples, reaching
      male partners and couples in order to engage them in HIV testing to enable identiﬁcation of
      discordant couples is an important ﬁrst step for any HIV prevention and treatment efforts.

      This is a feasibility study of the use of home-based HIV testing of partners and household
      members of individuals recruited from select ANC and TB clinics in Lesotho. This study uses
      an observational design to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based testing
      for HIV testing of partners and the effectiveness of this intervention to identify HIV
      discordant couples. It is hypothesized that a home-based testing intervention will increase
      the number of partners testing for HIV and will result in increased identiﬁcation of
      newly-diagnosed HIV-discordant couples, the target population of the planned Enhanced
      Prevention in Couples (EPIC) study.

      Primary objectives of this study include:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based testing for HIV testing of
           partners of index participants

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of home-based partner testing strategies to identify
           HIV-serodiscordant couples

        3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based testing for HIV testing of
           other household members of index participants Three-hundred men and women (index
           participants) will be recruited from antenatal and TB clinics. HIV testing teams will
           visit index participant households and offer home-based HIV testing to all adult
           household members.

A study testing team comprised of trained counselors and interviewers will visit the index participant's home on the pre-determined date/time and offer home-based HIV testing to those household members who are present.</description>

        Pregnant and postpartum women already tested for HIV attending participating antenatal
        clinics. Men and women already tested for HIV receiving care and treatment at participating
        TB clinics. This study will recruit women attending ANC and men and women attending TB
        clinics. All men and women recruited for the study will have already been tested for HIV
        and received their test results. These facilities were selected as entry points for the
        study as these clinics are locations where large numbers of individuals are offered HIV
        testing and become engaged in HIV prevention and/or care and treatment services.
