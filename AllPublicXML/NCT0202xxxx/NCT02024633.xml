      Research Hypothesis: icotinib administered in combination with gemcitabine has an acceptable
      safety profile in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of icotinib in
      combination with gemcitabine in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Three dose of icotinib are designed to be evaluated, 125 mg three times per day, 250 mg three times per day, and 375 mg three times per day. Dose escalations are based on predefined dose escalation decision rules. The Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) was reached at the dose level when at least 30% patients developed a dose limited toxicity.
Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle by IV administration every 4 weeks.</description>
