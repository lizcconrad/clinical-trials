    <textblock>
      In case of severe ankle arthritis, the two common surgical treatments are tibiotalar
      arthrodesis and total ankle arthroplasty. Few studies have compared these treatments and it
      remains difficult to determine which operation is the better solution for end stage ankle
      arthritis.

      The purpose of the present study is to analyze patient's outcome after each type of ankle
      surgery and to describe the decision making process.

For the total ankle arthroplasty arm, a revision will be defined as the change of any metallic component of the implanted device. The incidental change of the polyethylene will not be considered as a revision except when it is broken without any</description>
