      A phase I trial conducted in a single centre, observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2
      intramuscular injections of plant-based H7 VLP Influenza Vaccine administered to healthy
      adults, 18-60 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a dose-ranging in one hundred (100) subjects who will be
      randomized in parallel to a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio in five (5) groups of 20 subjects to receive one
      intramuscular injection at Days 0 and 21 of either a low, medium or high dose of H7 VLP
      vaccine mixed with Alhydrogel® 0.4% (0.5 mg Aluminum per dose) or a high dose of H7 VLP alone
      or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer + 150 mM sodium chloride
      (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80). Twenty-one (21) days after each immunization, key safety and
      immunogenicity data will be collected and analysed. All subjects will be followed for safety
      until Day 228.

             of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide written, informed consent
             for participation after reading the informed consent form. The subject must have
             adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator or qualified designee

          -  If female, have a negative pregnancy test result prior to first immunization

          -  Female of childbearing potential (except subjects in a monogamous same sex
             relationship), must use an effective birth control for the 28 days prior to
             immunization and must agree to continue employing adequate birth control measures from
             Day 0 (first immunization) until at least 60 days post-second immunization and must
             have no plan to become pregnant from Day 0 (first immunization) until at least 60 days
             post-second immunization. Highly effective birth control includes hormonal
             contraceptives (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], estrogenic vaginal ring, etc.),
             intra-uterine device (IUD), abstinence (confirmed by Investigator), or male condom
             plus spermicide. Abstinent subjects should be asked what method(s) they would use,
             should their circumstances change, and subjects without a well-defined plan should be
             excluded

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric
             illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as

             administration

          -  Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to study vaccine
             administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage
             adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable)

          -  Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event
             within one month prior to study vaccine administration

          -  Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject incompetent
             to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and
             reporting

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B or C, or the
             presence of lymphoproliferative disease

          -  Presence of any febrile illness, oral temperature of &gt;38.0˚C within 24 hours prior to
             immunization. Such subjects may be re-evaluated for enrolment after resolution of
             illness

          -  History of autoimmune disease

          -  Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within 30 days

             vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 42 or within 30 days prior to blood sampling
             at Day 228. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and diphtheria toxoids
             adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the vaccine is not administered
             within two weeks prior to study vaccine administration. Receipt of any other emergency
             immunizations (e.g., rabies) will result in a case-by-case review by the medical
             monitor of continued participation

          -  Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine other than a
             'simple' seasonal Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV) or Quadrivalent Inactivated
             Vaccine (QIV) within 1 year prior to study enrolment or planned administration prior
             to the end of this trial (Day 228)

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any
             other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this study

          -  Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone per
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,
             within one month of study vaccine administration, any other cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressant drug, or any globulin preparation within 3 months of vaccination.
             Low doses of nasal or inhaled glucocorticoids are generally allowed

          -  Use of high dose inhaled steroids or oral and parenteral high dose steroid
             medications. Nasal steroids are allowed

          -  Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             aspirin [≤ 325 mg/day (1 regular adult aspirin) or ≤ 81 mg/day (1 baby aspirin)], and
             without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible

          -  History of previous H7N9 vaccination or a history of exposure to H7N9 virus. Any

          -  History of allergy to any of the constituents of the H7 VLP (H7N9) study vaccine,
             Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide), or to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (used as
             placebo)

          -  History of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) to any food, medication
             or bee sting or previous severe asthma.

          -  History of tobacco allergy

          -  Continuous use of anti-histamines in the last 4 weeks prior to first immunization or
             use of anti-histamines 48 hours prior to each study immunization

             may interfere with injection site reaction rating

          -  Have received a blood transfusion within 90 days prior to study vaccination

          -  If female, positive pregnancy test results at screening, and prior to immunizations on

          -  Female subjects who are lactating

          -  Any vital sign abnormalities: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
             resting heart rate not well controlled or according to the Investigator's opinion

          -  Cancer or treatment for cancer within 3 years of study vaccine administration. Persons
