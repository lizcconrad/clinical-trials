  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance play a key role in the pathogenesis of polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS). Insulin resistance is significantly associated with the long-term
      risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Acupuncture with electrical
      stimulation has in rats with dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced PCOS been shown to improve
      insulin sensitivity. Whether these findings can be translated into women with PCOS has not
      been investigated. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether acupuncture improves
      insulin sensitivity, ovulation rate and quality of life in women with PCOS. Our hypothesis is
      that acupuncture with combined manual and low-frequency electrical stimulation of the needles
      improves insulin resistance, induces ovulation and improves quality of life.

      This is a prospective observational study. A total of 112 women with PCOS and insulin
      resistance will be recruited and randomized into two groups according to their body mass
      index (BMI), i.e. normal weight (BMI=18.5-23Kg/m2) group and overweight or obese (BMI &gt;
      23Kg/m2) group1. The acupuncture treatment will last for six months, 3 times per week, 30
      minutes per treatment. The primary outcome is changes in insulin sensitivity from baseline to
      after 6 months of acupuncture treatment measured by OGTT.
