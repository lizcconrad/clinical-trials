  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research the genetic and biomechanical markers of human adipose tissue on patients with
      morbid obesity. Additional tissue/fluid collection is also gathered during the time of
      surgery.

      Study participation by invitation. Patients will be invited to participate after completing
      all necessary clinical visits including lab studies, counseling, and participation in
      educational programs. During the pre-operative visit patients interested in participation
      will complete all necessary consent documentation, during surgery tissue collection will
      include subcutaneous &amp; omental fat, jejunum (Gastric Bypass), gastric remnant (sleeve
      gastrectomy), and liver biopsy. Post surgery patient will be observed for weight loss and
      resolution of co-morbidities. At designated times post surgery when lab studies are ordered
      additional blood/urine samples will be collected and analyzed.
