  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate blood oxygenation at the optic nerve head in relation with visual
      field losses observed in many Fabry patients. Data collected will allow to evaluate if there
      is a link between these two entities.

      Study will last up to 2 years during which a limited number of Fabry patients will be
      compared to a control group to confirm any relationship between blood flow and field losses,
      and to see if these results vary over time.

      HYPOTHESIS

      1. Fabry patients will present significant differences in visual fields compared to control 2
      There will be variability of the visual field defects on the long term but not on the short
      term 3 Blood oxygenation will be higher for Fabry patients 4 Blood volume at the optic nerve
      head will be the same for both groups.

    <intervention_name>Contrast sensitivity measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity test is made with targets alternating black and white lines. The larger the lines are, easier it is to see them. Targets are distributed in 5 rows, each oriented at a different angle. Contrast sensitivity level is determined by the smallest target seen by the participant, line by line. This test is done under dim lightning with the habitual visual correction worn.</description>

    <intervention_name>Slit Lamp assessment and intra-ocular pressure measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>Slit lamp is used to assess the presence of significant lens opacities known as Fabry cataracts. In fact, these opacities can induced a bias on the contrast sensitivity measurement and can increase the symptoms felt by the patient. A grade 2 (CFDI grading chart) of lens opacities is considered clinically significant and this will become an exclusion criteria for the following of the study. Intra-ocular pressure will be measured with a non contact tonometer (air pulsed) (Ocular Response Analyser, Reichert Instrumentation.)</description>

    <intervention_name>Visual field testing</intervention_name>
    <description>Visual field will be assessed with an automated perimeter (Humphrey, Texas) using a threshold strategy. This implies that the subject has to identify not only if he perceives the visual stimulus but the minimal level of this stimulus (in decibels), to be seen, is also recorded. Visual field will be tested up to 30 degrees from the central point of fixation.
In order to measure immediate variability of the visual testing among Fabry subjects, this test will be done at the beginning of the testing session (in the morning) and another time 1h00 later.</description>

    <description>Pupils will be dilated with 1 drop of 1% tropicamide. The procedure is similar to the one used for taking a photo of the retina. Each measurement session represents a continuous recording of 20 simultaneous functions of reflectometry from the optic nerve area during 10 seconds.
During all recording sessions, the systemic arterial oxygen saturation will be also monitored at the right index finger using a pulse oximeter (Escort M10, Invivo, Orlando, USA). Arterial blood pressure will be also monitored before and after the testing using a manual sphygmomanometer.</description>

The system operates with 1200 discreet wavelengths between 400 nm to 700 nm with 500 millisecond integration times. It is not invasive, functioning just like a fundus camera.</description>
