  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center study of adipose stem cell (ASC)
      implantation. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose or fat. Liposuction using local
      anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via needle
      injection into the eye.

    <description>Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. VA is tested by requiring the person whose vision is being tested to identify so-called optotypes - stylized letters, Landolt rings or other patterns - on a chart from a set viewing distance.</description>

          -  Patients with dry AMD

          -  Visual acuity in the study eye &lt;20200 (equal to or worse than 20/200)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Inability to undergo syringe liposuction procedure or have any medical problems that
             contraindicate the procedure.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses.

          -  Vitrectomized eyes

          -  Exposure to any investigational drug or procedure within 1 month prior to study entry
             or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study.

          -  Active infectious disease. . If patients have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV,
             CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis, an expert will be consulted as to patient eligibility
             based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which might affect a patient's survival over the follow-up period

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgement, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  Patients with severe coagulation disorders

          -  Cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the
             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  Severe COPD or severe asthma that would contraindicate surgery

          -  History of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer) in
             the last two years.

          -  Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent.
