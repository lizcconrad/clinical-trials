  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial with overweight and obese college
      students on the University of Minnesota campus. The primary outcome will be weight loss
      measured 12 months after study enrollment (corresponds to 10 months after the end of
      treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% of college students are overweight or obese. Intervening on excess weight
      early may eliminate obesity-related morbidity. Evidence supports use of monetary incentives
      to encourage weight-loss; questions remain about the efficacy of contingency management on
      weight loss maintenance.

      &quot;Lose 2 Win&quot; contests in which participants who achieve weight-loss goals are eligible for
      cash prizes, appear well-suited for implementation on campuses. Our objective in this
      two-phase trial is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of Lose 2 Win for
      weight-loss maintenance among college students.

    <description>The Contest Plus group were eligible to receive the financial incentives for weight loss maintenance at three monthly follow ups; weeks 16, 20 and 24. Eligible participants completed online surveys and in person weigh ins verifying weight maintenance. In addition to the financial incentives, participants in this group had bi-weekly in person meetings with a Registered Dietician during phase 2 (week 16-24) of the trial. They also received an in home scale to monitor weight daily.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Contest Plus group had the opportunity to receive 5 in person meetings with a Registered Dietician. These meetings took place bi-weekly and gave the participants a chance to discuss food consumption, physical activity, meal planning and assessed the participant's weight at each visit.
Participants in the Contest only and Control group were not eligible to receive these meetings.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Contest Plus and Contest Only groups were eligible for a lottery based financial incentive for maintaining their weight lost during phase 1 (Baseline to week 10) of the trial. There were three, month-long follow up assessments (weeks 16, 20 and 24) that participants were eligible for. The lottery prize was contingent upon the length of time they maintained their weight loss.</description>
