  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is required to overcome pain and to evoke recalcification in multiple myeloma
      (MM) patients. Approximately 70% of all MM patients receive one or more radiotherapies in the
      course of their illness. The relief of pain is obtained in 75 - 100%. Recalcification is
      achieved in 40 - 50% of the irradiated bone destructions.There were a lot of randomized
      trials showed the same effect of single (SF) and multiple fractions (MF) in pain relief and
      recalcification for patients with painful bone metastases from solid tumors. The role of
      different palliative radiotherapeutic regimens for MM is not well established due to lack of
      clinical trials. Our prospective study analyzed the effect of two different radiotherapeutic
      regimens in the treatment of MM on pain relief, analgesics consumption and recalcification.

      The primary aim of our prospective study is to analyzed the effect of two different
      radiotherapeutic regimens in the treatment of MM on pain relief, the secondary aim is to
      analyzed the effect of two different radiotherapeutic regimens in the analgesics consumption
      and recalcification.

      Eligibility criteria are age more than 18 years, Karnofsky index more than 40%, patients with
      painful bone destructions, patients with impending fracture in the region of destructions.

      Exclusion Criteria are: patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, patients with
      solitary plasmacytoma, patients who had received previous irradiation to the present painful
      destruction site, patients who were incapable to complete the quality of life questionnaires,
      patients with poor health status.
