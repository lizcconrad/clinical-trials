  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) together with the safety and
      tolerability of JDP-205 at 5 mg and 10 mg intravenous doses and 10 mg intramuscular dose, in
      comparison to the marketed cetirizine oral product ZyrtecÂ® 10 mg tablets (an OTC product) in
      healthy male and female volunteers after a single dose administration.

         11. Any clinically significant illness in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study

         12. Use of any enzyme-modifying drugs, including strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450
             (CYP) enzymes (such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, quinidine, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin,
             fluconazole, ketoconazole, diltiazem and HIV antivirals) and strong inducers of CYP
