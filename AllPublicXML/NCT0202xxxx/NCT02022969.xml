    <textblock>
      Even though experimental lung injury in animal experiments is the best analogy for the
      changes in the patients, it has to be considered that kinetics may vary between species. An
      important question to answer is how common PaO2-oscillations occur in patients and how
      injurious they might be. A limitation to the detection of PaO2-oscillations is a sensing
      device that detects the oscillations at very high temporal resolution. In previous studies a
      fiberoptic probe was used, which was measuring PaO2 based on oxygen-sensitive fluorescence
      quenching with a time resolution up to 10 Hz (8, 13, 14). This method is not feasible in
      patients. Previous studies have shown that PaO2-oscillations are translated into the
      peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2). Given a technology that has a time resolution
      that is high enough (i.e. &gt;1 Hz), measurement of SpO2-oscillations would be a valid approach
      to detecting and quantifying cyclical recruitment and derecruitment in a non-invasive fashion
      in patients on the ICU. The Masimo Rad-8 pulse-oxymeter provides such a method. In the
      current study it is planned to deteted SpO2-oscillations in the post-operative patients on
      the ICU.

      As stated above cyclical recruitment and derecruitment has been shown a mechanism of VALI. It
      has further been demonstrated that PaO2-oscillations in the systemic circulation are
      transmitted to endorgans (i.e. brain, kidney and other peripheral organs). There have no
      studies quantifying PaO2- or SpO2-oscillations in human subjects. The rationale of this study
      is to measure non-invasively SpO2-oscillations throughout the respiratory cycle as PaO2
      oscillations cannot easily be detected. We will analyse SpO2-oscillations in a cohort of
      post-operative patients. Atelectasis is a major risk factor for pulmonary complications. As
      it occurs in up to 90% of surgical patients this phenomenon is highly relevant. Patients with
      large areas of atelectatic lung tissue are prone to cyclical recruitment and derecruitment
      and consecutive SpO2-oscillations.

      There will be two groups of patients: One with a high risk for atelectasis and one with low
      risk for atelectasis. The patients are stratified by the type of surgery. Upper abdominal
      surgery with a duration of more than 2 hours has been shown to be an independent risk factor
      for atelectasis. Therefore, we chose to assign patients scheduled for abdominal surgery with
      an anticipated duration of surgery of more than 4 hours for the high-risk group. Patients
      with neurosurgical procedures with more than 4 hours will be assigned to the low risk group.
      In each patient the SpO2-oscillations will be measured at three different respiratory rates
      (RR). The rationale for this is that previous studies showed that cyclical recruitment and
      derecruitment is dependent on the RR.
