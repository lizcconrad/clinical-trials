  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphorus-based food additives are commonly used by food manufacturers for many
      applications, such as enhancing flavor, in ready-to-eat foods and beverages. While these
      additives can significantly increase an individual's daily phosphorus intake, little is known
      about the effect of dietary phosphorus on kidney health. In this study, the investigators
      will first lower baseline phosphorus intake to about 1000mg/d by educating participants to
      avoid foods with phosphorus additives. Then, participants will be randomized to a higher
      phosphorus period (~2gm/d) and a lower phosphorus period (~1gm/d) by providing unaltered,
      commercially-available food/beverage products with and without phosphorus additives.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants will have higher urine albumin excretion and
      fibroblast growth factor-23 during the higher phosphorus period compared to the lower
      phosphorus period.
