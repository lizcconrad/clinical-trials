      Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in São José do Rio Preto-SP-Brazil

      Abstract

      Objective: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among
      patients from São José do Rio Preto-SP-Brazil .

      Local: Departamento de Retina e Vítreo do Hospital do Olho de Rio Preto (HORP)

      Methods: Design: population-based cross-sectional study. The study sample, of 710 patients
      was derived from the HIPERDIA (Diabetes and High-blood pressure social health care program)
      of São José do Rio Preto . All patients , known to have diabetes , underwent an eye
      examination by biomicroscope and indirect ophthalmoscope to check for any signs of DR through
      dilated pupils. Participants were also interviewed and examined to determine their
      demographic characteristics, medical conditions and the realization of previous fundoscopic
      eye examination. Statistical studies were done with t -Student test , Fisher test or
      chi-square test.

      Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in São José do Rio Preto-SP-Brazil

      Abstract

      Objective: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among
      patients from São José do Rio Preto-SP-Brazil .

      Local: Departamento de Retina e Vítreo do Hospital do Olho de Rio Preto (HORP)

      Methods: Design: population-based cross-sectional study. The study sample, of 710 patients
      was derived from the HIPERDIA (Diabetes and High-blood pressure social health care program)
      of São José do Rio Preto . All patients , known to have diabetes , underwent an eye
      examination by biomicroscope and indirect ophthalmoscope to check for any signs of DR through
      dilated pupils. Participants were also interviewed and examined to determine their
      demographic characteristics, medical conditions and the realization of previous fundoscopic
      eye examination. Statistical studies were done with t -Student test , Fisher test or
      chi-square test.

      Results: Among 710 screened patients 112 had some degree of diabetic retinopathy and the
      overall standardized prevalence of any retinopathy was 16,3%., including 90 (80,4%) with
      non-proliferative and (22) 19,6 % with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Only 143 patients
      (68,7%) had a history of previous fundoscopic eye examination.

      Conclusion: This study demonstrated that DM and their complications are a important public
      health problem. The duration of DM and glicemic control is strongly associated with DR .
      Prevention programs with periodic fundoscopic exams shows to diminished the prevalence of
      this ocular disease.
