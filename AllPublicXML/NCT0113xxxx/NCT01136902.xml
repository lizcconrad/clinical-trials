      The overall objective is to investigate, whether retinal blood vessel diameter change during
      the energy consuming dark adaptation process and if responses vary between low and high blood
      glucose.

      All subjects are being studied using the same procedure. The study schedule takes place from
      8 a.m. to 12 a.m. every time. Each subject shows up on one single day. Subjects are to show
      up fasting overnight with a break in insulin and/or oral antidiabetic treatment.

      The study eye of each subject will be selected by randomisation. We seek to have an equal
      distribution of right and left eyes overall.

      A first set of images will be taken after 5 minutes in &quot;standardised daylight&quot;, in a room
      without light from outside, which eliminates any concerns about weather variations. After
      this the room is completely darkened. 2 set of images will be taken in the dark adapted state
      after 20 and 40 minutes. Subsequently the patient ingests the OGTT and will reach maximum
      blood glucose level after about 60-90 minutes. At this time, the subjects undergo the same
      &quot;photo session&quot; as above with high blood glucose levels.
