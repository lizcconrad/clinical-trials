  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Cardiac Diagnostic and Interventional Unit (CDIU) at the Hospital for Sick Children
      (SickKids), minimally invasive procedures are performed to diagnose and treat a variety of
      congenital heart defects. Procedures are performed under general anesthetic and involve
      inserting a catheter through the skin and into the femoral vein or artery in the groin. In
      addition, the use of local anesthetic as a pain control regimen just prior to the removal of
      femoral artery or vein sheaths is used by some but not all cardiac interventionalists. Local
      anesthetic is infiltrated near the sheath insertion site, at the end of the procedure while
      the child is under general anesthetic, with the goal of decreasing pain at the insertion site
      and promoting comfort in the post-operative period. The use of local anesthetic depends on
      the choice of the individual practitioner and is not currently a routine practice for all
      patients.

      The investigators proposed research seeks to investigate whether the use of subcutaneous
      bupivacaine reduces pain levels in the post-operative period in children having cardiac
      catheterization procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of differences in pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures exist that limit the
      transferability of research findings from the adult literature. For example, the majority of
      pediatric cardiac catheterizations are performed under general anesthetic, and femoral
      sheaths are removed while under general anesthetic and at the end of the procedure. In
      contrast in adult clinical practice, procedures are not performed under general anesthetic,
      and femoral sheaths are removed when patients are awake and often 4 to 6 hours after the end
      of the procedure. These differences limit the ability to apply research findings in adults to
      pediatrics, warranting further study of the effects of local anesthetic on femoral site pain
      in children. As well, studies in adults have examined pain only up to 20 minutes after sheath
      removal. We seek to investigate the impact of bupivacaine up to 6 hours after cardiac
      catheterization in children.

    <time_frame>For 6 hours after admission to the CDIU</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is self-reported levels of pain using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will be asked to verbally rate the amount of femoral pain experienced between 0-10 on admission to CDIU recovery, and at 15 and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after admission.
We will be examining the change in pain scores over time as well as the total pain experienced by the paitents. These measures will be compared between the two treatment groups.</description>
