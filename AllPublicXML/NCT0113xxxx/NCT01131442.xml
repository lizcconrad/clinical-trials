    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal
      disorder.Many children suffered from this disease and had impact on their daily life.
      However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain to be elucidate. Dysregulation of
      the gut immune system is considered an important pathophysiology. We want to investigate the
      immunological changes in the IBS children.
