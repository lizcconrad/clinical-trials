    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a novel model of including parents in
      adolescent weight control results in greater decrease in adolescent z-BMI compared to an
      intervention with minimal parent involvement.

    <measure>Parent Modeling 1: Dietary Choices (WCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Parent modeling of dietary choices was assessed using the Diet Choices subscale of the Weight Control Strategies Scale (WCSS), a parent-report measure of his/her own healthy weight control practices. The Dietary choices subscale of the WCSS has a scale range of 0 - 4, with higher scores corresponding to healthier diet choices. Higher scores are considered to be a better treatment outcome.</description>

    <measure>Parent Modeling 2: Self-monitoring (WCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Parent modeling of self-monitoring behavior was assessed using the Self Monitoring subscale of the Weight Control Strategies Scale (WCSS), a parent-report measure of his/her own healthy weight control practices. The Self Monitoring subscale of the WCSS has a scale range of 0 - 4, with higher scores corresponding to more self-monitoring behavior. Higher scores are thought to reflect a better treatment outcome.</description>

    <measure>Parent Modeling 3: Physical Activity (WCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Parent modeling of Physical Activity was assessed using the Physical Activity subscale of the Weight Control Strategies Scale (WCSS), a parent-report measure of his/her own healthy weight control practices. The Physical Activity subscale of the WCSS has a scale range of 0-4, with higher scores corresponding to greater physical activity. Higher scores are considered a better treatment outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Modeling 4: Weight and Body Concerns (FERF-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Parent modeling of concern about weight/body was assessed using the Parent Modeling of Weight and Body Concerns subscale of the Family Experiences Related to Food Questionnaire (FERF-Q)), an adolescent-report measure of parent behavior pertaining to weight control. The Weight and Body Concerns subscale of the FERF-Q has a scale range of 1 - 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater parent weight and body concerns, as perceived and reported by the adolescent. Lower weight and body concern is considered a better treatment outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication 1: Negative Maternal Weight-related Commentary (FERF-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Negative maternal weight-related commentary was assessed using the Negative maternal weight-related commentary subscale of the Family Experiences Related to Food Questionnaire (FERF-Q)), an adolescent-report measure of parent behavior pertaining to weight control. The Negative maternal weight-related commentary subscale of the FERF-Q has a scale range of 1 - 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater negative maternal weight-related commentary, as perceived and reported by the adolescent. Lower scores are considered a better treatment outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication 2: Observed Parent-adolescent Communication Quality (DOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Observed parent-adolescent communication quality was measured using the Dyadic Observed Communication Scale (DOCS) used to code communication between adolescent and caregiver during a video-taped observational coding session. The DOCS is coded on a scale of 0 -10, with higher scores reflecting higher quality of communication, as observed by an independent rater. Higher scores are thought to reflect a better treatment outcome.</description>

        <title>Parent Modeling 4: Weight and Body Concerns (FERF-Q)</title>
        <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Parent modeling of concern about weight/body was assessed using the Parent Modeling of Weight and Body Concerns subscale of the Family Experiences Related to Food Questionnaire (FERF-Q)), an adolescent-report measure of parent behavior pertaining to weight control. The Weight and Body Concerns subscale of the FERF-Q has a scale range of 1 - 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater parent weight and body concerns, as perceived and reported by the adolescent. Lower weight and body concern is considered a better treatment outcome.</description>

        <title>Communication 2: Observed Parent-adolescent Communication Quality (DOCS)</title>
        <description>Post-treatment value (controlling for baseline). Observed parent-adolescent communication quality was measured using the Dyadic Observed Communication Scale (DOCS) used to code communication between adolescent and caregiver during a video-taped observational coding session. The DOCS is coded on a scale of 0 -10, with higher scores reflecting higher quality of communication, as observed by an independent rater. Higher scores are thought to reflect a better treatment outcome.</description>
