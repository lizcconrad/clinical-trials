  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-1127
      (glyburide for injection), administered as a bolus dose followed by a 3 day continuous
      infusion. The secondary objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetics of RP-1127 and blood
      glucose and serum insulin PD responses to RP-1127.

          4. Have a body mass index of between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/mÂ², inclusive.

          5. A clinically normal physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), screening
             laboratory studies and urinalysis.

          6. A negative urine or saliva test for selected substances of abuse and cotinine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant history of hypoglycemia as assessed by the investigator.

          2. History of seizure disorder, even if currently not receiving anticonvulsant
             medications.

          3. History of adverse reaction to glyburide, other sulfonylurea class of anti-diabetic
             medications, or other sulfa drugs.

          4. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency as determined by G6PD enzyme
             testing at screening.

          5. Be an active smoker or user of other forms of tobacco. Former smokers or tobacco users
             must have refrained from smoking or using other forms of tobacco for at least 6 months

          6. A history or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic (including diabetes
             mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or dyslipidemia), hematologic, pulmonary,
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, hepatic, renal, urologic, immunologic,
             or psychiatric disorders (a history of mild depression, currently not receiving
             therapy, is acceptable).

          7. Use any prescription medication within 14 days prior to randomization, or
             nonprescription drugs within 7 days. Exceptions may be made by the medical monitor on
             a case-by-case basis.

          8. Received another investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization.

          9. A positive hepatitis virus test (Hepatitis B virus surface antigen or hepatitis C
             virus antibody) or a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test at
             screening. If the HIV test is positive, the subject will be informed privately and
             referred for additional counseling.
