  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I study using vinblastine and sirolimus in patients with relapsed solid
      tumors including selected brain tumors and lymphoma. The investigators hypothesis is that the
      combination administration of weekly vinblastine and sirolimus is safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Published data demonstrating a survival advantage of the vinblastine-sirolimus regimen vs
      single agent in an orthopotic neuroblastoma mouse model and our unpublished data support a
      VBL in vitro pro-apoptotic plasma concentration of 1-2 nM range and an anti angiogenic
      concentration of 2pM. These plasma concentrations are achievable with a 6 mg/m2 (apoptosis)
      and 1 mg/m2 VBL regimen (anti-angiogenesis) weekly regimen. We expect that vinblastine
      delivered at any given dose, as described in the protocol, will carry both anti-apoptotic and
      antiangiogenic activity. Safety and preliminary efficacy of both drugs in pediatric tumors
      support the development of a clinical trial.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dose will be escalated every 3 to 6 patients using the 3+3 standard design regimen. Enrollment of the next cohort will occur after the previous cohort has completed a full cycle without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If a DLT is observed in 1 out of 3 patients during the first cycle, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to receive the same dose. If a DLT is observed in another patient, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to receive a dose level below this dose. The MTD will be defined as the dose level below which DLTs are seen in ≥ 2 of at least 6 patients dosed.</description>

    <measure>Safety data</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data will be described for all patients receiving at least one dose of vinblastine and sirolimus. Safety data will include values for hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs, and adverse events. The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events, dose limiting toxicities and treatment delays will be summarized for each dosing cohort.</description>

    <description>The standard 3+3 Phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of this study. Three to six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of three has been enrolled until toxicity data for that cohort have been reported, or when the study endpoints have been met.</description>

    <description>Patients will be enrolled to receive vinblastine and sirolimus in 28 day cycles. Using the 3+3 standard Phase1 design, vinblastine will be administered via IV push on Days 1, 8, 15, 22. The starting dose of 4 mg/m2 (Dose Level 1) is 67% of the established MTD (6 mg/m2) for this schedule in pediatrics. Dose escalation will take place in a standard 3+3 design, in which doses will increase by approximately 20 to 25% in successive 3-patient cohorts.
Sirolimus (rapamycin) will be given by mouth (tablet or suspension) once daily throughout the cycle. Ideally patients will remain on the same dose form (tablet or suspension) for the duration of the study. All patients will be assigned a target sirolimus serum trough</description>
