      The purpose of the EVOLVE Trial is to assess the safety and performance of the
      everolimus-eluting Evolution stent for the treatment of a de novo atherosclerotic lesion of
      up to 28 mm in length in a native coronary artery 2.25 mm to 3.5 mm in diameter. The safety
      and performance of two different drug release rate formulations of the Evolution Stent will
      be compared to the commercially available PROMUS (TM) Element (TM) drug-eluting stent.

                       patients do not need to be available prior to the index procedure and there
                       are no exclusion criteria based on these studies.

          -  Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a waiting list for an organ

             hepatitis

          -  Patient is on dialysis or has known renal insufficiency (e.g. serum creatinine level
             &gt;2.0 mg/dL)

          -  Patient has active peptic ulcer disease, an active gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, other
             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or will refuse transfusions

             balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 12 months prior to
             the index procedure

          -  Target vessel has been treated within 10 mm proximal or distal to the target lesion
             (by visual estimate) with any type of PCI (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting
             balloon, atherectomy) at any time prior to the index procedure

          -  Non-target vessel (including side branches) has been treated with any type of PCI
             (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 24 hours prior
             to the index procedure Note: 1 lesion in a non-target vessel may be treated during the
             index procedure prior to the treatment of the target (study) lesion. The treatment of
             lesion(s) in non-target vessels more than 24 hours prior to the procedure does not
             preclude the treatment of an additional non-target lesion during the index procedure.
             For example, a patient could have an RCA lesion treated 7 days prior to the index
             procedure and then have a non-target lesion in the LCx and a target lesion in the LAD
             treated during the index procedure.

             fluoropolymers, everolimus, thienopyridines, aspirin, contrast) that cannot be
             adequately premedicated

          -  Patient has one of the following.

               -  Other serious medical illness (e.g., cancer, congestive heart failure) that may
                  reduce life expectancy to less than 24 months

               -  Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.

               -  Planned procedure that may cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound
                  data interpretation

             has not reached its primary endpoint
