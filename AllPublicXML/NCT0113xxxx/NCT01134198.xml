  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will evaluate the impact of blocking central and peripheral glucocorticoid
      receptors on stress sensitivity and the risk of relapse to cocaine use in treatment-seeking
      cocaine-dependent individuals. Mifepristone (RU-486) will be the glucocorticoid antagonist
      used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study attempts to reduce relapse risk by blocking glucocorticoid receptors, and thus
      allow some of the changes in the brain caused by cocaine to redress themselves

          3. History of allergic, dermatological, or adverse event to mifepristone
