    <textblock>
      Study conducted in large Brazilian hospital, with the main objective of evaluating the impact
      of pre-anesthetic in reducing costs related to the preoperative preparation of patients
      admitted to undergo surgery or diagnostic procedures under anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pre-anesthetic evaluation is essential in the care of surgical patients. Among its
      benefits stands the reduction of costs related to preoperative preparation. However, most
      studies evaluating costs was performed in hospitals abroad, whose reality does not always
      apply to our environment. The aim of this study is to compare the costs of preoperative
      evaluation performed by the surgeon (conventional tillage), with the cost of preparation
      performed by the anesthesiologist (pre-anesthetic evaluation). Two hundred patients scheduled
      for surgical or diagnostic procedures under anesthesia form included in the study. After
      admission patients were assessed by physician anesthesiologists. In Form 1 (conventional
      tillage), it was noted tests or specialist consultations made in the preoperative period. In
      Form 2 (pre-anesthetic evaluation) was noted comorbidities, physical examination and
      complementary examinations given in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the
      Anesthesiology Department of the institution. Form data were compared with a data form 2.
      Besides the costs, we compared the number of tests considered unnecessary and disagreements
      in the classification of physical status according to the American Society Anesthesiology
      (ASA).
