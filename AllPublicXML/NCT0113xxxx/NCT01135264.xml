  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed two-arm randomized controlled trial, 200 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for
      PG will be randomized to 12 sessions of Cognitive-Motivational Behavior Therapy (CMBT) or to
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMBT has been developed by our team over the last five years, and has shown very promising
      results in a small, NIMH-funded randomized pilot trial (R21 MH 064568). We will assess
      patients biweekly during the active treatment phase and follow them for 12 months after the
      end of treatment to obtain data on long-term treatment outcome. We hypothesize that CMBT will
      show higher efficacy and retention than CBT in the treatment phase, and that gains will be
      maintained at a higher rate during follow-up.

      A second major purpose of the proposed study is to elucidate the presumed mechanisms of
      change by examining potential mediators (readiness to change, irrational beliefs about
      gambling, coping skills, therapeutic alliance) and moderators (psychiatric comorbidity with
      Axis I and II disorders, family history of PG, impulsivity, and baseline motivation to
      change) of treatment response. A better understanding of how the proposed interventions work
      will help advance the science and treatment of PG and will be helpful in the future
      refinement and adaptation of CMBT. Identifying patient subgroups for which the intervention
      is particularly effective is essential for rational treatment selection. Thus, the immediate
      goal of the project is to compare CBMT versus CBT for the treatment of PG. A long-term goal
      of the proposed research is to establish effective treatment procedures that reduce the
      considerable individual and social costs of PG.

    <description>The CBT treatment developed by Ladouceur (Consultant) will serve as control condition (outline of published treatment manual by Ladouceur &amp; Lachance, 2006. This treatment served as a model for the cognitive-behavioral component in CMBT and has received empirical support in two studies from Ladouceur's lab (Sylvain et al., 1997; Ladouceur et al., 2004). It places strong emphasis on cognitive correction of erroneous beliefs about gambling and also focuses on coping skills training and relapse prevention. CBT also lasts 12 weekly sessions.</description>
