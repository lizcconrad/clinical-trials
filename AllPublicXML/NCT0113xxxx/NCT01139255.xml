  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity play a role in both cancer incidence and survival rates. Many people
      have found attending weight loss support groups to be time-intensive. Past research has shown
      electronic media, particularly the Web, to be effective in producing weight loss. The Web,
      however, lacks portability, which prevents people from accessing the information when it is
      convenient for them. Providing weight loss information via podcasting (audio files that may
      be listened to on portable audio players) may allow people to receive weight loss tips
      anywhere. A previous research study showed that podcasts emphasizing healthy eating and
      exercise can help people lose weight. This study was short-term and did not include
      additional social support. The purpose of this research project is to assess the
      effectiveness of a weight loss intervention delivered through podcasts as compared to the
      same podcast with added mobile media such as self-monitoring software (such as a pedometer)
      and support delivered via a social networking site. For this research study, the
      investigators will conduct a 6-month study in 104 overweight adults to determine if a podcast
      plus mobile media support leads to greater weight loss than a podcast alone.
