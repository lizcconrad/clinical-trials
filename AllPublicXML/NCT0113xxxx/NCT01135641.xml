      The main objective of the study is to improve the response rate (complete and partial
      remission) at 12 months after diagnosis of chronic Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)
      and treatment with the combination of ciclosporine, prednisone and Rituximab as first line
      treatment.

    <description>As soon as the diagnosis of chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy is confirmed, patients will receive in addition to ciclosporine A and corticosteroids (prednisone) 1 mg/kg/day, Rituximab at 375 mg/m²/infusion once a week for 4 consecutive weeks.Rituximab should be administered within 14 days of starting prednisone. Follow-up dates for response assessment and laboratory tests relate to the date of Rituximab infusion.Patients having a partial response after the 1st cycle of Rituximab will be eligible to receive a second cycle of 4 infusions during 4 weeks. A delay of 8 weeks (from the first infusion of Rituximab) will be observed between the two cycles of Rituximab therapy.Patients who relapse after an initial treatment with one cycle of 4 infusions of Rituximab will be eligible to receive a second cycle of Rituximab therapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (≥18 years) who have received a first allogeneic stem cell
             transplantation for a hematological disease

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of first episode of chronic GVHD requiring systemic
             immunosuppressive therapy. Chronic GVHD diagnosis is defined according to the NIH
             Working Group Consensus. Chronic GVHD diagnosis will be based on the evaluation of the
             severity of the different clinical manifestations including :

               1. Ocular, oral and mucosal symptoms,

               2. Performance status evaluation,

               3. Pulmonary function evaluation,

               4. Cutaneous evaluation measured by the percentage of extension of manifestations of
                  liche-noid or sclerodermatous aspects, eventually confirmed with a biopsy
                  whenever possible,

               5. Evaluation of the musculoskeletal manifestations, especially the amplitude of the
                  rele-vant articulations,

               6. Evaluation of liver involvement (Total bilirubin, Transaminases, Phosphatase
                  alcalines and Gamma GT).

          -  Any source of hematopoietic stem cells is authorized.

          -  Any category of conditioning regimen prior to allo-SCT is authorized.

          -  Any type of stem cell donors is authorized.

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Any prior GVHD prophylaxis previously used is accepted.

          -  Absence of contra-indications to the use of Rituximab.

          -  Subjects affiliated with an appropriate social security system.

          -  Women who are of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study and
             for 3 months following the end of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient developing acute GVHD (whether early or &quot;late onset&quot; form)

          -  A &quot;limited&quot; form of chronic GVHD not requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Treatment with prednisone (or equivalent) at doses higher than 1 mg/kg/day at the time
             of enrollment.

          -  GVHD occurring following donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI)

          -  Not the first episode of chronic GVHD needing systemic immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Neutropenia &lt;500/µL

          -  Second allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Uncontrolled systemic infection which in the opinion of the investigator is associated
             with an increased risk of the patient's death within 1 month after the start of
             therapy

          -  Severe neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Denied informed consent

          -  Pregnancy
