    <textblock>
      This research is being done because it is not yet known what dose of foretinib in combination
      with lapatinib can be given safely to patients with breast cancer, nor what type and severity
      of side effects will result from the combination of the two treatments. This research is also
      being done because it is not clear if the addition of the new drug foretinib to treatment
      with lapatinib can offer better results and longer survival than treatment with lapatinib
      alone.

      The purpose of this study is to find the dose of foretinib that can safely be given in
      combination with lapatinib. This is done by starting at doses of both drugs lower than the
      usual doses of each when given on their own. Patients are given foretinib and lapatinib and
      are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects
      are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to join the
      study and are given higher does of foretinib and lapatinib. Patients joining the study later
      on will get higher doses of foretinib and lapatinib than patients who join earlier. This will
      continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher
      than that will not be given.
