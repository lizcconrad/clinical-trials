      A dose escalation study designed to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose,
      anti-melanoma activity, antibody blood levels and progression-free survival in patients with
      malignant melanoma receiving IMC-20D7S either every two weeks or every three weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal
             malignant melanoma which has progressed after or during at least 1 treatment with
             standard cytotoxic treatment or/and immunotherapy (eg, treatment with cytokines,
             monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines) and is not regarded to be a candidate for a
             potentially curative, higher priority treatment for melanoma

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Patient has either measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 or evaluable disease

          -  At least 21 days must have elapsed from major surgery, prior chemotherapy, prior
             treatment with an investigational agent or device, or prior radiation therapy.
             Relative to patient's treatment with non-approved biological products (eg, monoclonal
             antibodies), a minimum of 2 half-lives must have passed for eligibility to be
             considered

          -  Patient has resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior cancer
             therapy to Grade ≤ 1 according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.02

          -  Patient has adequate hematological function, hepatic function, and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has undergone major surgery (eg, laparotomy, thoracotomy, removal of organ[s])
             within 21 days prior to study entry

          -  Patient has elective or planned surgery to be conducted during the trial

          -  Patient has documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Patient is receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             medications.(Intermittent use of steroid-containing medications, eg, for asthma
             exacerbation or for skin lesions, is permitted)

          -  Patient has an uncontrolled undercurrent illness

          -  Patient has a concurrent active malignancy other than adequately treated
             nonmelanomatous skin cancer or other noninvasive carcinoma or in situ neoplasm

          -  Patient has a known allergy to any of the treatment components (monoclonal antibodies
             or other therapeutic proteins such as fresh frozen plasma, human serum albumin,
             cytokines, or interleukins). In the event that there is suspicion the patient may have
             allergies, the patient should be excluded

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating

          -  Patient has known HIV or AIDS infection
