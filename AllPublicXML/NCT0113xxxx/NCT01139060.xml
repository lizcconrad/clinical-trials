    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test the effectiveness of an organized care program for chronic or
      recurrent depression. Using a two-arm design, the investigators will randomly assign 300
      participants with chronic or recurrent depression to one of two conditions: continued usual
      care (UC); or an 18-month organized treatment program focused on outreach and engagement,
      including a weekly group self-management training program, monthly visits with a
      psychotherapist (in-person or by telephone), and optional one-on-one visits with a peer
      support specialist. All intervention components are intended as adjuncts to any existing
      depression treatment (usually antidepressant medication) provided by participants' regular
      providers.
