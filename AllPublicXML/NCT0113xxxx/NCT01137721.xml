  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a serious blood disease with blood vessel changes leading to
      brain injury and stroke. Studies show about 11% of patients with SCA will develop obvious
      stroke before age 20 years, with children less than 10 years of age especially vulnerable.
      The main objective of the SCDMR4[State Of The Art Functional Imaging In Sickle Cell Disease]
      trial is to compare the gray matter cerebral blood flow, measured by MRI,[magnetic resonance
      imaging] ASL [Arterial Spin Labeling] perfusion before treatment begins and after the
      appropriate hydroxyurea dosage is reached (~ one year). Other important objectives of the
      SCDMR4 trial include describing the effect of hydroxyurea therapy and transfusion therapy on
      the functional MRI response, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, brain function, and
      transcranial Doppler blood velocities.

      The Primary Objective of the study is to compare the research participant's GM [Gray Matter]
      CBF [Cerebral Blood Flow] by ASL [Arterial Spin Labeling] techniques before and after
      reaching a stable hydroxyurea MTD [Maximum Tolerated Dose] (12±3 months after starting
      hydroxyurea).

      This is an observational study. Participants receive hydroxyurea as part of their standard of
      care treatment. This study will observe the above measures prior to beginning hydroxyurea and
      after participants reach the maximum tolerated dose in order to describe the effect of
      therapy on the participants' functional response.

        The potential research participants will be recruited, screened and consented from the
        School-Age and Teen Sickle Cell Clinics by the referring St. Jude hematology
        co-investigators. There will be no advertisement per se. Affiliate hematology
        co-investigators will contact St. Jude hematology co-investigators about potentially
        eligible research participants. Affiliate potential research participants will be screened,
        and if appropriate, consented and tested at St. Jude institution.
