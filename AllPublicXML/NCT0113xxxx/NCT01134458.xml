  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an evaluation that will assess three important components of risk
      communication:

        1. provide patients with personalized risk communication using the risk calculator
           developed by FIMDM and health information taken from the Living with Coronary Artery
           Disease program

        2. provide personalized tailored patient feedback to help initiate and maintain specific
           cardiovascular CVD-related behaviors(e.g., medication adherence, exercise, diet, smoking
           cessation) to reduce their risks.

        3. evaluate how this feedback can be incorporated into clinical care by examining 3 month
           patient outcome and provider responses to the risk information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high risk for CVD events frequently underestimate their risk. Programs to improve
      CVD outcomes have largely focused on single risk factors and do not contextualize the
      information with a patient's global risk. An easy, accessible strategy to address global CVD
      risk based on personalized risk communication feedback with assistance with initiating and
      maintaining health behaviors has several advantages, but has not formally been tested. A
      patient's perceived risk of stroke or heart attack is an important factor in understanding
      motivation for risk reducing behaviors. Lower perceived risk has been associated with poorer
      adherence to recommended health behaviors. Additionally, a person's beliefs about his or her
      risk for a disease increased the likelihood of a more informed and activated patient, and
      figures prominently in models of health behavior (e.g., Health Belief Model). People tend to
      underestimate their own risk; Therefore providing accurate risk communication has the
      potential to activate patients to initiate and maintain behavior changes.

    <description>Trained personnel will obtain the patients' outcome values (i.e., weight, height, BP) at baseline and subsequent 3-month outcome using a digital sphygmomanometer and digital scale according to a standard protocol. The baseline interview includes demographics and an assessment of patients' health behavior, perceived risk, and interactions with their provider. At 3-month follow-up visit, patients will also undergo an in-person interview to determine changes in weight, smoking status, medication adherence, decisional conflict, knowledge.</description>

    <description>Given current risk assessment for CVD based on Health Dialog Cardiac Risk Calculator, recommendations for behavior change, and Health Dialog's Living with Coronary Heart Disease. Can change initial patient risk information provided by the Risk Calculator during the initial visit, noting what they are will work on during the study. Sent monthly email reminders to log onto the system to choose that months' behavioral modules. Given a choice of at least 2 health behavior modules per month (smoking cessation, exercise, diet, and weight) to improve their CVD risk. Information on risk, CVD knowledge, medication management and side effects will be provided to all participants. It will also provide tailored information to help the individual initiate and maintain these behaviors.</description>
