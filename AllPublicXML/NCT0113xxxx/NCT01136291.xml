      Objective: To evaluate the association between physical exercise for obese or overweight
      women and the maternal, perinatal outcomes and perception of these women about their quality
      of life.

      Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial with 78 pregnant women. Overweight or obese
      (BMI ≥ 26 kg / m²), gestational age between 14 and 24 weeks and from age 18 years were
      included. They will be divided into two random groups: one which will an exercise program
      under supervision and guidance received from home exercises (study group) and another that
      followed the standard routine prenatal care service (control group). Both groups will receive
      standardized nutritional counseling by the department of nutrition and dietetics and a
      questionnaire measuring quality of life WHOQOL-short at 14 - 24 weeks and at 36 weeks of
      pregnancy. The intervention results will be analyzed by intention to treat. A P value less
      than 0.05 will be used to determine statistical significance.
