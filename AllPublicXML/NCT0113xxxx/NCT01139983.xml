      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying DNA biomarkers in samples from patients with
      osteosarcoma and healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether common copy-number alterations (CNAs) at chr7p14.1 arise de novo in
           osteosarcoma (OS) tumor DNA or whether they represent progression of constitutional
           copy-number variations (CNVs).

        -  To determine the association between constitutional CNVs at chr7p14.1 and susceptibility
           to OS.

        -  To determine how CNVs translate into CNAs in tumor DNA samples from patients with OS.

      OUTLINE: RNA and DNA samples from banked blood and paired tumor tissue, plus samples from
      healthy controls, are analyzed for common copy-number alterations and constitutional
      copy-number variations (CNVs) at chr7p14.1 by microarray, q-PCR, RT-PCR, and FISH.
      Osteosarcoma predisposing CNVs results are then compared among cases versus healthy controls.

      Clinical information associated with each osteosarcoma sample (i.e., gender, age of
      diagnosis, tumor site, tumor type and grade, presence of metastases at time of diagnosis,
      response to chemotherapy, event-free survival, and overall survival) is also collected, if
      available.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 243 samples from patients with osteosarcoma and 80 samples from
      healthy controls will be accrued to this study.
