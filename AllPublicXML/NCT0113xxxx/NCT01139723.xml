  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open label, dose-escalation study of MINT1526A
      administered alone and in combination with bevacizumab by IV infusion every 3 weeks to
      patients with advanced solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has
      proven to be ineffective or intolerable.
