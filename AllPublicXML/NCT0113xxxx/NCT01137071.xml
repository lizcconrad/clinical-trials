  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu3S193, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well Hu3S193 works as a consolidation therapy
      for women with relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter trial with Hu3S193 as a single agent in a consolidation
      strategy in patients with relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal and
      fallopian tubes cancer who achieve a second Complete Response after a platinum-based
      chemotherapy after platinum-based chemotherapeutical regimen. Fifty-one (51) patients with
      relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tubes adenocarcinoma
      will receive doses of 30 mg/m2 of Hu3S193 as a single agent every two weeks, in a total of 12
      doses (treatment period duration: 23 weeks). After the treatment period, patients will be
      evaluated every 3 months for the first two years, and every 6 months for more 3 years, and
      then in an annual-basis until disease progression or death, whichever happens first.

    <measure>1-year PFS2 Rate After the Beginning of Rescue Platinum-based Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Year - From platinum-based rescue chemotherapy start date until documented disease progression or death of any cause whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS2 is defined by the interval from the beginning of rescue platinum-based chemotherapy until documented disease progression or death for any cause while the patient was under study or during the prolonged follow-up period.
Disease progression is defined by appearance of any new lesion (measurable and non-measurable) by the RECIST criteria. Disease progression date is the date when a new lesion is documented.</description>
