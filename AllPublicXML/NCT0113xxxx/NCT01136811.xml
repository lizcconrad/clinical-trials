    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of the daVinci
      surgical system (computer-assisted surgery) for use in vascular surgery procedures. Although
      the daVinci Surgical System is FDA approved and widely used for surgical procedures for
      urology, cardiac, general, and gynecologic procedures, it is not currently approved
      specifically for use in vascular surgery and the FDA has required the PI to conduct a small
      feasibility study under an IDE. The investigators are seeking approval by the FDA to utilize
      the daVinci Surgical System in vascular surgery and to conduct a future clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant femoropopliteal or tibial occlusive disease not amenable to
             catheter directed therapy (ie angioplasty/stenting). Symptoms include
             lifestyle-limiting claudication, rest pain and/or tissue loss.

          -  Patients with an ABI between 0.2 and 0.8.

          -  Femoropopliteal disease visible on color duplex ultrasound (DUS)

          -  Patent and minimally diseased common femoral and proximal superficial artery

          -  Patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I, II or III classification

          -  PT/PTT, EKG, HbA1c, liver function, within normal ranges within 30 days prior to
             procedure or stable over the last 6 months.

        Current University of Chicago Medical Center Lab standards will be used. Pulmonary function
        will be assessed as needed by preoperative anesthesia evaluation. (Generally for
        infrainguinal procedures, pulmonary function is not assessed)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;40

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous surgery in the inguinal region (ie: prior femoral artery dissection)

          -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within the last 6 months

          -  Laboratory evidence of hypercoagulable state and/or connective tissue disease

          -  Pregnant women

          -  History of non-compliance with medical care
