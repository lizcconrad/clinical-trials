    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure on or After Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until end of study (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Treatment failures on or after Week 6 were counted as events. Dropouts for reasons other than treatment failure at any time during the study were censored at the dropout date. To be considered a treatment failure, ≥ 1 of these criteria had to be present in at least 1 eye:
New active, inflammatory chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesions relative to Baseline
Inability to achieve ≤ 0.5+ at Week 6 or a 2-step increase relative to best state achieved at all visits after Week 6 in anterior chamber cell grade or vitreous haze grade
Worsening of best corrected visual acuity by ≥ 15 letters relative to best state achieved.
Per protocol, the primary analysis was performed in the Main Study population which included all randomized participants recruited outside Japan; for completeness results are also reported below for the Integrated dataset which includes participants recruited in Japan.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Grade in Each Eye From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 6 and at the Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell;
Grade 0.5+ = 1-5 cells;
Grade 1+ = 6-15 cells;
Grade 2+ = 16-25 cells;
Grade 3+ = 26-50 cells;
Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade in Each Eye From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 6 and Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze;
Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized;
Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry;
Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>

    <measure>Change In Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) In Each Eye From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 6 and Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Using corrective lenses based on that visit's refraction testing, participant's best corrected visual acuity was measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Evidence of Macular Edema in At Least 1 Eye On or After Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the Final Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Optical coherence tomography was performed at every visit using 1 of 3 approved machines. Images were evaluated by a central reader. Macular edema was defined as cystoid macular edema.
OCT evidence of macular edema on or after Week 6 was to be counted as an event. Dropouts due to reasons other than OCT evidence of macular edema were to be considered as censored observations at the time of dropping out.</description>

          -  Subject is diagnosed with non-infectious intermediate-, posterior-, or panuveitis.

          -  Subject must have active disease at the Baseline visit as defined by the presence of
             at least 1 of the following parameters in at least one eye despite at least 2 weeks of
             maintenance therapy with oral prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day to ≤ 60 mg/day (or oral
             corticosteroid equivalent):

               -  Active, inflammatory, chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesion

               -  ≥ 2+ anterior chamber cells (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature [SUN]
                  criteria)

               -  ≥ 2+ vitreous haze (National Eye Institute [NEI]/SUN criteria)

          -  Subject is on oral prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day to ≤ 60 mg/day (or oral corticosteroid
             equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening and remains on the same dose from
             Screening to Baseline visit.

          -  Subject with documented prior adequate response to oral corticosteroids (equivalent of
             oral prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/day).

          -  Subjects who do not have previous, active or latent tuberculosis (TB). Only one TB
             test is required to allow the subject in the study. Subjects with either negative
             purified protein derivative (PPD) (&lt; 5 mm of induration) or negative QuantiFERON®-TB
             Gold test (or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) equivalent) are eligible. Subjects
             with a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) result are
             not eligible. Note, that only one TB screening test is allowed and required. A repeat
             QuantiFERON® TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) is not permitted if the PPD skin test
             is positive. The TB screening tests are diagnostic tests. In the event of a negative
             TB screening test, the results are to be interpreted in the context of the patient's
             epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc. and it is the responsibility of the
             investigator to determine if a patient has previous, active or latent tuberculosis or
             not. Under no circumstances can a patient with a positive PPD result or positive
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) enter the study.

        <title>Time to Treatment Failure on or After Week 6</title>
        <description>Time to treatment failure was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Treatment failures on or after Week 6 were counted as events. Dropouts for reasons other than treatment failure at any time during the study were censored at the dropout date. To be considered a treatment failure, ≥ 1 of these criteria had to be present in at least 1 eye:
New active, inflammatory chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesions relative to Baseline
Inability to achieve ≤ 0.5+ at Week 6 or a 2-step increase relative to best state achieved at all visits after Week 6 in anterior chamber cell grade or vitreous haze grade
Worsening of best corrected visual acuity by ≥ 15 letters relative to best state achieved.
Per protocol, the primary analysis was performed in the Main Study population which included all randomized participants recruited outside Japan; for completeness results are also reported below for the Integrated dataset which includes participants recruited in Japan.</description>

        <title>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade in Each Eye From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</title>
        <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze;
Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized;
Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry;
Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>

        <description>Optical coherence tomography was performed at every visit using 1 of 3 approved machines. Images were evaluated by a central reader. Macular edema was defined as cystoid macular edema.
OCT evidence of macular edema on or after Week 6 was to be counted as an event. Dropouts due to reasons other than OCT evidence of macular edema were to be considered as censored observations at the time of dropping out.</description>

        <title>Change in Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25) Composite Score From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</title>
        <description>The National Eye Institute VFQ-25 is an ocular disease-specific survey that measures the influence of visual disability and visual symptoms on generic health domains such as emotional well-being and social functioning, in addition to task-oriented domains related to daily visual functioning.
The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions plus an additional single-item general health rating question. The overall composite score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores or increases in score indicate better vision-related functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in VFQ-25 Distance Vision Subscore From Best State Achieved Prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</title>
        <description>The National Eye Institute VFQ-25 is an ocular disease-specific survey that measures the influence of visual disability and visual symptoms on generic health domains such as emotional well-being and social functioning, in addition to task-oriented domains related to daily visual functioning.
The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions plus an additional single-item general health rating question.
The distance vision subscore is calculated from the answers to 3 distance vision-related questions and ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores or increases in score indicate better vision-related functioning.</description>
