      Primary Objective: Evaluation of the utility of real-time, scope-to-scope communication
      between commercially-available 3M Littmann Electronic Model 3200 Electronic stethoscopes over
      a dedicated intranet system for the assessment of patients at remote (satellite) clinic
      locations by centrally-located (hub) medical providers.

      Secondary Objective: Comparison of the accuracy of patient assessment between the remotely
      located, mid-level presenter with the centrally-located physician or nurse practitioner
      provider.
