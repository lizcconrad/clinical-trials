    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-blind, matched controlled study aims to evaluate the effect of
      proton pump inhibitors on biochemical markers of calcium and bone metabolism in an effort to
      establish additional biological plausibility for the apparent association between proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) and osteoporosis-related fractures.

      Young males (age 18-45 years), who are either healthy volunteers, or who complain of daily or
      frequent heartburn but are otherwise healthy, will be recruited and enrolled in the study.
      Patients with heartburn will be assigned to the intervention group and will be assigned to
      take a PPI for three months. Healthy volunteers will be matched by age to patients in the
      intervention group and will act as the control group. 70 patients will be enrolled in total.
      Blood studies for all subjects will be taken at 0, 1 and 3 months to test for various
      biochemical markers of calcium and bone metabolism, which act as surrogate markers of calcium
      absorption and bone remodeling.

      Levels of biochemical markers in the two groups will be compared using two-way analysis of
      variance (ANOVA). Changes in biochemical parameters within a group will be assessed using
      repeated measures ANOVA.
