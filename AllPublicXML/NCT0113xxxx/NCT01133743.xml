  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-randomized, single institution study in symptomatic, previously
      untreated CLL patients. All patients will receive the study drug, lenalidomide, given PO
      daily continuously on a 28 day cycle at the starting dose level of either 2.5 mgs or 5 mgs
      with dose escalations to a target dose of 25mg daily. Oral dexamethasone at 12 mg PO daily
      will be administered on days 1-7, 14 and 21 of each cycle. Patients will be treated with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone to 2 cycles past CR or to a maximum of 18 cycles, each cycle
      of 28 days duration. Primary endpoint is response.

             functioning bone marrow. Patients must be &gt;/= 4 weeks since last treatment with
             radiation therapy.

             Surgery: previous surgery is permissible. Patient must be &gt;/= 4 weeks since any major
             surgery.

             criteria. One or more of the following must be present to be eligible:

               -  Massive (&gt;10cm diameter), progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy

               -  Massive (&gt;6 cm below costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly

               -  Anemia (Hb &lt;110 g/L)

             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Evidence of laboratory TLS by Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome.
