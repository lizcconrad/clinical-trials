      The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data
      following administration of vaccinations with HLA-A2. This data will be used to decide
      whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted.

        chemotherapy during or after radiation. (Note: Stratum B is open to accrual.)

        Stratum C: Unresectable low-grade gliomas that have received at least two
        chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Patients may not have received radiation to the index
        lesion within 1 year of enrollment. (Note: Stratum C is closed to accrual.)

        Stratum D is closed to accrual.)

        Stratum E: Newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas* or brain stem gliomas who received
        chemotherapy during radiation therapy. Patients may not have received chemotherapy after
        radiation therapy was completed. (Note: Stratum E is closed to accrual.)

        Stratum F: Newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas with metastatic disease within the CNS
        requiring craniospinal radiation therapy. Patients may or may not have received
        chemotherapy during radiation, but cannot have received chemotherapy after radiation
        therapy was completed. (Note: Stratum F is closed to accrual.)

          -  Eligible histologies include glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or
             gliosarcoma. Patients with any oligodendroglioma component are NOT eligible.

          -  HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.

          -  Patients in Stratum A B and E must have received standard involved field radiation
             therapy [RT] defined as fractionated external beam radiotherapy with total doses
             between 5000-6000 cGy. Patients in these strata must be registered within 4-12 weeks
             of completing RT.

          -  Patients in Stratum F must have received craniospinal radiation.

          -  Patients must be clinically stable and off or on low-dose (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day,

             registration.

          -  All patients must sign an IRB-approved informed consent document

          -  Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt;22 years of age at the time of study registration.

             institutional normal for age; SGPT (ALT) &lt; 3x institutional normal.

        Renal: Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt;70
        ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m²

          -  Patients on Strata C and D must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior
             therapy: at least 3 weeks form the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or
             myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last dose of
             non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy.

          -  No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients living outside of North America are not eligible.

        Patients in Stratum F must have tumor spread within the CNS.

        Patients enrolled in Strata A and B may not have received any prior chemotherapy or
        anti-glioma therapy of any type other than radiation therapy. Patients enrolled on stratum
        C must have received at least two prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy regimens and may
        not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Patients on
