    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Select Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.

          -  Phase 2: Histological or cytological confirmation of predominant clear cell RCC
             (original tissue diagnosis of RCC is acceptable).

          -  Documented evidence of unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC. Phase 2: Radiographic
             evidence of disease progression according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Phase 2: One prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted treatment (for
             example, but not limited to, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, bevacizumab, axitinib,
             vatalanib, AV951/tivozanib) for unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC.

          -  Phase 2: Measurable disease meeting the following criteria: a.) at least 1 lesion of
             greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in the longest diameter for a non-lymph node or
             greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in the short axis diameter for a lymph node which is
             serially measurable according to Modified RECIST 1.1 using computerized
             tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) or photography. Subjects must have an
             Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive
             medications, defined as BP less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening and no
             change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to the Screening Visit.

        Select Exclusion Criteria:

        Phase 1b or Phase 2 specific per below:

          -  Phase 1b only: Subjects with untreated or unstable metastasis to the central nervous
             system (CNS) are excluded. Subjects who have completed local therapy and have
             discontinued the use of steroids for this indication at least 4 weeks prior to
             commencing treatment and in whom stability has been proven by at least 2 CT or MRI
             scans obtained at least 4 weeks apart are eligible for Phase 1b only. Phase 2 only:
             Subjects with CNS (e.g., brain or leptomeningeal) metastasis are excluded.

          -  Phase 2 only: More than one prior VEGF-targeted treatment for unresectable advanced or
             metastatic RCC.

        Phase 1b or Phase 2 specific per below:

          -  Phase 1b only: Prior exposure to lenvatinib. Phase 2 only: Prior exposure to
             lenvatinib or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.

          -  Subjects should not have received any anti-cancer treatment within 21 days or any
             investigational agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and should
             have recovered from any toxicity related to previous anti-cancer treatment. Major
             surgery within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Subjects having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24-hour urine
             collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria.

          -  Subjects with urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24-hour will be ineligible.
             Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose at 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Phase 2 only: Active malignancy (except for renal cell carcinoma, melanoma in-situ,
             basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix)
             within the past 24 months.

          -  Known intolerance to any of the study drugs (or any of the excipients) and/or known
             hypersensitivity to rapamycins (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus) or any of
             the excipients.

          -  Phase 1b only: Subjects who discontinued prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor due to
             toxicity will be ineligible.
