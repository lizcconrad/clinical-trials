      The B/B Checker, a new portable device for detecting odorous compounds in oral, exhaled, and
      nasal air, is now available. As a single unit, this device is capable of assessing several
      kinds of gases mixed with volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in addition to other odorous
      gasses. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the B/B Checker
      for detecting the malodor level of oral, exhaled, and nasal air.
