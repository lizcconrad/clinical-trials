  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigaotors want to establish a real-time and computerized score reporting system
      based on the significant predictors of the measured sonographic parameters and demographic
      data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred eight patients with neck lymphadenopathy, receiving ultrasonography and
      ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA), were used to construct a predictive model.
      This model was validated by another independent patient cohort.

        patients with previously untreated neck masses were referred for sonographic evaluation and
        subsequent US-FNA after informed consent was obtained. Demographic data, including age and
        sex, side, site, and number of lymphadenopathy was collected as well.
