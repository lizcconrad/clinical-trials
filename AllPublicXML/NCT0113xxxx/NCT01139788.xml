      Study CXBA is a multicenter nonrandomized, dose escalation, open-label, Phase 1 study of
      intravenous LY2624587 in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer for which no treatment
      of higher priority exists.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Present with histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer (solid
             tumors, lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) that is advanced and/or metastatic.
             The patient must be, in the judgement of the investigator, an appropriate candidate
             for experimental therapy after available standard therapies have been used.

          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Revised International Working Group
             Lymphoma Response Criteria, or National Cancer Institute Working Group Guidelines for
             Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

          -  Have adequate organ function.

          -  Have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale.

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved
             contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test
             less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Have discontinued chemotherapy and cancer-related hormonal therapy with
             commercially-available agents for at least 21 days (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or
             nitrosoureas) and radiotherapy for at least 14 days prior to study enrollment and
             recovered from the acute effects of therapy (less than or equal to National Cancer
             Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.02; Grade 1).
             Hormone refractory prostate cancer patients receiving gonadotropin releasing hormone
             (GnRH) agonist therapy or breast cancer patients on anti-estrogen therapy (for
             example, an aromatase inhibitor) prior to entrance on the study may have that
             treatment continued while they are enrolled in Study CXBA.

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment with an investigational drug, which has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication, within 28 days of study treatment with
             LY2624587.

          -  Have medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in this study.

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system malignancy or metastasis. Patients with
             treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable,
             asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or
             anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastases
             is not required.

          -  Have a history of major organ transplant.

          -  Have current acute leukemia.

          -  Have active human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C
             antibodies.

          -  Have QTc greater than 470 msec (female) or greater than450 msec (male), history of
             congenital long QT syndrome or other conduction abnormality.

          -  Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant.

          -  Previously treated with a CXCR4 antagonist, or have had a significant allergy to
             biologic agents.
