      This dose response study is proposed to explore the extent to which Nexium increases
      endogenous gastrin concentrations and to assess whether Nexium treatment may be useful in the
      setting of islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes to expand islet cells in vivo after
      transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation has been shown to effectively treat type 1 diabetes by stabilizing
      blood glucose control while reducing/eliminating the need for exogenous insulin injections.
      However, for reasons still not fully understood, islet graft function tends to decline with
      time after transplant. Gastrin has been identified as a growth factor capable of stimulating
      islet cell expansion. Proton pump inhibitors are known to increase endogenous gastrin
      concentrations. This dose response study is proposed to explore the extent to which Nexium
      increases endogenous gastrin concentrations in healthy volunteers and to assess whether
      Nexium treatment may be useful in expanding islet cells in patients with type 1 diabetes.
      Three Nexium dose levels will be tested to determine the optimal dose for increasing plasma
      gastrin levels. The effect of Nexium on plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, c-peptide,
      glucagon, and somatostatin will also be monitored.
