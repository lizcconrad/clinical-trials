  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect that weight loss has on the severity of
      psoriasis in obese subjects. Fifty obese (BMI equal to or greater than 30) patients with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be enrolled in a weight loss intervention program.
      The severity of their psoriasis will be reevaluated at month 3 and month 6 of the program to
      determine what effect weight loss has had on their psoriasis. Serum TNF-alpha will be
      measured at month 0 and month 6. The hypothesis that will be tested is that weight loss will
      lead to a significant improvement in the severity of psoriasis and a reduction in TNF-alpha
      levels.

    <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is the most common validated psoriasis severity assessment tool used in clinical trials, and combines redness, thickness, and scaliness of skin lesions with the body surface area that is affected. Most clinical trials define moderate to severe psoriasis as a PASI score of greater than or equal to 10, or a total Body Surface Area (BSA) of greater than or equal to 10%.</description>
