  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label phase I trial to investigate the effects of moderate to
      severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in comparison with healthy
      volunteers. Furthermore the short-term safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      prucalopride will be assessed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I trial two groups of 6 to 8 hepatically impaired subjects will be evaluated.
      The first group are the moderate hepatic impairment (Grade B) subjects and the second group
      the severe hepatic impairment (grade C) subjects. Subjects for both groups will be recruited
      and treated in parallel. After all subjects with hepatic impairment completed the treatment a
      third group with matching healthy volunteers will be recruited. Eight healthy subjects will
      be selected matching for age, gender and weight (BMI based).

      The subjects will receive a single dose of 2 mg prucalopride in the morning after overnight
      fasting followed by the consumption of a standard breakfast after 2 hours.

      Pharmacokinetic evaluation of blood samples will be done immediately before and at a specific
      timepoint up to 120h post-dosing. Urine samples will be taken to determine prucalopride.

      Adverse events, including serious adverse events, will be reported from signing the Informed
      Consent until the last visit. Safety blood samples and a urine sample for urinalysis will be
      taken.
