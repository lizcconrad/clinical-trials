    <textblock>
      Phase 4, open-label, two-year, prospective, multi-center, follow-up study will be conducted
      in up to 15 active sites in the United States. All patients will receive 1 dose of Ablavar as
      part of an MRI examination in their routine clinical management. Prior to undergoing an
      Ablavar MRI, patients will have a baseline serum creatinine test within 24 hours prior to
      Ablavar administration, will sign an Informed Consent (IC) form, will undergo a limited exam
      for skin abnormalities, and will undergo a brief medical history assessment on the day of and
      prior to Ablavar administration. A standardized NSF questionnaire will be administered to the
      patient at 48 (+ or -12) hours, 1 month (+ or - 1 week), 3 months (+ or - 2 weeks), 6 (+ or -
      1) months, and 18 (+ or - 1) months post-dose. At 12 (+ or - 1) months, and at 24 (+ or - 1)
      months. Patients will return to the clinic for a limited examination for skin abnormalities
      and formal review of signs and symptoms suggestive of NSF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Kidney Disease with GFR &lt; 60 mL/min./1.73 m^2. Clinical Need to Receive an MRI with
        Contrast. Understand &amp; Sign Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of known or suspected NSF. Has received any gadolinium based contrast agent within
        12 months prior to enrollment.

        Has a clinically significant skin disorder which may interfere with detection of cutaneous
        NSF manifestations.

        Has any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease the
        chances of obtaining reliable data and achieving study objectives.

        Is unable or unwilling to return for necessary office visits or follow up calls, and/or to
        be examined by a physician or undergo deep skin biopsy should the development of NSF be
        suspected.
