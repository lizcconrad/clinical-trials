    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a multidisciplinary approach to improve
      the adhesion and persistence to Clopidogrel therapy. A simple and inexpensive therapy
      management involving a tighter monitoring of patients by nurses and pharmacists will improve
      the persistence and adhesion to Clopidogrel and Aspirin after the implantation of
      drug-eluting stents.

    <textblock>
      Optimal treatment with Clopidogrel and Aspirin is critical for preventing complications after
      implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES). The premature cessation of Clopidogrel is a well
      recognized factor of thrombosis of stents, especially DES. Indeed, there remains a large
      portion of patients that prematurely stop clopidogrel. No study has demonstrated that a
      therapeutic management program could improve patient compliance to their antiplatelets.
      Through an open-label clinical study, two groups of patients who just received their DES will
      be compared: one with the usual protocol (consisting of seeing the cardiologist 6 weeks after
      the intervention) and one with the normal care supplemented by a simple and efficient
      follow-up (consisting of phone calls at 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 9 months explaining the
      importance of antiplatelet therapy, evaluating the health of the patient and well received
      prescription from the pharmacy). Patients in both groups will receive a prescription to
      Clopidogrel and Aspirin (for 1 month), with 11 renewals.
