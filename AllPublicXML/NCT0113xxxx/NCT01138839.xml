  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of dexamethasone for treatment of
      HELLP I (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of HELLP syndrome usually is restricted to measures of support and treatment of
      complications. In 2005, in a subgroup analysis we showed that, among patients with HELLP 1,
      there were a shorter average time to platelet recovery and less duration of hospitalization
      in women who received dexamethasone therapy, however the importance of this finding is
      diminished because this was an unplanned analysis and the severity of the disease was not
      taken into account at randomization.
