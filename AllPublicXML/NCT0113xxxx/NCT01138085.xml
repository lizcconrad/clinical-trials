    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 dose-escalation open-label study to determine the recommended Phase
      II dose (RP2D) and regimen for the combination of the orally administered MEK inhibitor
      GSK1120212 and the orally administered AKT kinase inhibitor GSK2141795. The study consists of
      two parts. Part 1A will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a Zone-Based,
      modified 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure. The starting dose (Zone 1, Cohort 1) will be
      0.5mg GSK1120212 combined with 25mg GSK2141795. Dose escalation will continue based on
      predefined parameters until a MTD is established. The initial regimen for dose escalation in
      Part 1A will be continuous oral daily dosing. Once the continuous daily dosing MTD or RP2D
      has been established in Part 1A, Part 1B will explore alternate dosing schedule(s) in which
      the dosing schedule may be adjusted for either GSK1120212 or GSK2141795. Dose escalation will
      proceed using a 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure until an MTD or RP2D of that alternate
      schedule is defined. Part 2 will explore further in specific tumor types the safety,
      tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of
      the combination of GSK1120212 and GSK2141795 at the recommended dose(s) and regimen(s)
      identified in Part 1.

    <description>Enrollment into expansion cohort(s) in Part 2A may begin once a recommended dosing regimen(s) is identified in Part 1A utilizing a once daily continuous dosing schedule for both GSK1120212 and GSK2141795. Enrolment to cohorts utilizing this daily dosing schedule may proceed in parallel with enrolment in Part 1B. Expansion cohort(s) will preferentially enroll subjects with treatment-refractory, measurable and biopsiable triple negative breast cancer or BRAF- wild type melanoma. Subjects selected for enrollment into Part 2A or Part 2B will be tested for PTEN deficiency and must agree to provide paired tumor biopsies (at baseline and once while on- treatment). An additional tumor biopsy at the time of disease progression should also be collected if feasible.
In Part 2A and Part 2B, up to 35 additional subjects per tumor type and schedule (i.e., a total of up to 70 subjects per schedule tested) may be enrolled in a two-stage design to better characterize safety, PK and PD.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part 1 - Dose Escalation

        Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria:

        Male or female 18 years or older, at the time of signing the informed consent.

        Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements
        and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy that is not
        responsive to standard therapies or for which there is no approved or curative therapy or
        for subjects who refuse standard therapy (Part 1A). Part 1B subjects must have a confirmed
        diagnosis of one of the following (documented lab results confirming mutational status must
        be available at Screening):

        colorectal cancer (CRC): KRAS mutation non-small cell lung (NSCLC): KRAS mutation
        Pancreatic: no mutational status specified Endometrial: no mutational status specified
        Ovarian: no mutational status specified Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: no
        mutational status specified BRAF wild type melanoma (preferentially enrolled to Part 2)
        BRAF inhibitor failure melanoma. This includes BRAF-mutant melanoma that is either
        initially refractory to BRAF-inhibitor therapy OR that Initially responds to BRAF-inhibitor
        therapy but eventually develops documented radiographic progression to a BRAF inhibitor
        while on therapy Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (preferentially enrolled to Part 2)
        NOTE: Subjects who do not meet one of the categories described above but who have molecular
        evidence suggesting benefit from the study drugs may be considered for enrollment after
        discussion with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor.

        Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
        (ECOG) scale.

        Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Must agree to collection of blood samples for the evaluation of circulating free DNA
        (cfDNA) (Part 1B or Part 2).

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
        greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml [less than 140 pmol/L] is
        confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] and whose menopausal status is
        in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1.1 if they
        wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
        confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at
        least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
        interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
        post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
        contraceptive method.

        Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
        Section 7.3.2 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
        investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy
        at that point. Additionally, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum
        pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Female subjects
        must agree to use contraception until four weeks after the last dose of study medication.

        Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interaction and
        should only be used in combination with the alternative methods outlined in Section 8.1.1.

        Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1.2.
        This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until
        four months after the last dose of study medication.

        greater than or equal to 1.5 X 10 to the ninth/L Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.5
        g/dL Platelets greater than or equal to 75 X 10 to the ninth/L Prothrombin time (PT) /
        International Normalized Ratio (INR) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) less than or
        equal to 1.1 X ULN Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin
        greater than 1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less
        than 35 percent) AST and ALT less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN Albumin greater than 2.5 g/dL
        Creatinine less than or equal to ULN OR Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or

        Fasting Serum Glucose les than 126mg/dL Cardiac Ejection fraction greater than or equal to
        lower limit of normal (LLN) by ECHO

        Inclusion Criteria for Part 2 - Expansion Cohort:

        Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:

        Triple negative (estrogen receptor(ER)-/ progesterone receptor(PR)-/ human epidermal growth
        factor receptor 2 (HER2)) breast cancer in the locally advanced or metastatic setting
        BRAF-wild type melanoma. Based on emerging data, subjects with these tumor histologies may
        be required to meet specific genetic selection criteria if those criteria are felt to
        improve the likelihood that a given subject will respond to study drug(s). If this is to
        occur, the site and the Investigational Review Board (IRB) will be notified but this change
        will not constitute a protocol amendment.

        Known Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) status of tumor. At least 6 of the subjects
        enrolled in Stage 1 with each tumor type will have PTEN deficiency while at least 6 others
        will be PTEN wild type.

        If the subject's tumor PTEN status was previously determined by an acceptable, analytically
        validated assay (i.e., Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization
        (FISH), sequencing, copy number analysis) then PTEN by IHC at Screening will not need to be
        repeated for the purpose of enrollment in this study. However, archival tumor tissue or
        tissue from a fresh biopsy specimen should be submitted for confirmation of PTEN status by
        a central laboratory using IHC.

        If PTEN status was not previously determined, archival tissue from a previous tumor biopsy
        specimen must be available for PTEN IHC analysis; if archival tissue is not available or
        found to not contain tumor tissue, a fresh biopsy is required to obtain tumor tissue for
        testing.

        Subjects in Part 2 that have been previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes must also meet
        the additional following criteria:
