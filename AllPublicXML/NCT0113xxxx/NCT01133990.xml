      The purpose of the Phase Ib portion is to find out the highest dose of study drug that can
      safely be given when tested in a small group of subjects.

      The purpose of the Phase II portion is to find out how safe the study drug is when taken at
      the highest dose in a larger group of subjects.

      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib portion: a safety
      run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7820; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 3-arm
      design. Approximately 135 patients with measurable, nonresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, who have failed first-line chemotherapy, will be
      enrolled in the study (approximately 15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 120 patients in
      the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or the Phase II
      portion of the study. Patients will receive up to a planned total of 6 cycles of study
      treatment unless there is occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, withdrawal by the Investigator, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever
      occurs first. After 6 cycles, patients in Arm 3 (FOLFIRI + E7820) who demonstrate clinical
      benefit may continue single agent E7820 for long as clinical benefit is sustained and the
      treatment is well tolerated. If the treating physician does not feel comfortable
      discontinuing chemotherapy after 6 cycles, further chemotherapy may be considered following
      discussion with the medical monitor and sponsor.
