  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study to test the novel hypothesis that Exenatide treatment
      in patients with type 2 diabetes results in improved sleep duration and quality and to
      explore the relationship between improvements in sleep and measures of metabolic and
      circadian function. This project would be the first to probe the relationship between
      incretin hormone regulation, duration and intensity of sleep, glucose tolerance and circadian
      dysfunction in diabetic patients.
