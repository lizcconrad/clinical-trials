    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the safety and overall clinical performance of the
      Endeavor Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System in a patient population with long
      lesion(s) and/or dual vessels requiring stent implantation.

    <textblock>
      A total of 249 to 411 patients will be enrolled from Asia at approximately 25 centers where
      Endeavor Resolute stent is commercially available. There are two study cohorts:

        1. 38 mm cohort: a minimum of 46 patients and maximum of 111 patients with at least one
           lesion amenable to treatment with a 38 mm length Endeavor Resolute stent. Patients may
           have one or two lesions, if the two lesions are located in separate target vessels.

        2. Dual vessel cohort: a minimum of 203 patients and maximum of 300 patients with dual
           vessel treatment where each vessel has a lesion with length ≤ 27 mm and reference vessel
           diameters between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm.
