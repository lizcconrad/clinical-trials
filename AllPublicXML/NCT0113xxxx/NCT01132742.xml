  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in children has even more severe consequences on disease course and long-term
      health than malnutrition in adults. According to prior studies, malnutrition affects about
      15-30 % of hospitalized children in Europe (ESPGHAN 2005, Pawellek et al 2008, Joosten and
      Hulst 2008). However, available criteria for defining malnutrition in paediatric patients are
      inconsistent, not based on firm evidence, and not generally agreed upon. Current guidelines
      do not address assessment of and screening for childhood malnutrition. Therefore, a large
      number of affected children are not adequately diagnosed.

      One aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and patients at risk for
      malnutrition among at least 2700 hospitalized children mainly across Europe. In addition
      criteria to link anthropometric measurements and the prediction of outcome, i.e. length of
      hospital stay, shall be established. A further goal then is to establish agreed,
      evidence-based criteria for malnutrition in children with the purpose of leading to an
      agreed, evidence-based screening tool for paediatric malnutrition in developed countries.
      This tool shall include a set of simple questions, based on previously suggested tools.
      Thereby this study will provide a strong basis for implementing evidence-based nutritional
      interventions in paediatric patients by harmonisation of diagnostic criteria for childhood
      malnutrition in developed countries.
