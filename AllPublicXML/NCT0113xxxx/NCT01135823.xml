  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the proposed research is to explore methods of obtaining symptom
      assessments from pediatric oncology patients and/or their caregivers in hopes of improving
      the accuracy and thoroughness of these reports. Additionally the researchers hope to simply
      staff efforts in obtaining detailed medical histories from pediatric oncology patients.
