  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in young adults has been increasing, and excessive body weight have
      been linked to numerous chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many
      forms of cancer, and numerous musculoskeletal problems. This study will focus of the
      development and evaluation of interventions that may be appropriate for young adults (age
      18-35 years) to improve weight loss outcomes following a 24 month intervention. The primary
      aim of this study is to examine whether an enhanced weight loss intervention (EWLI) that
      includes technology components results in improved weight loss in young adults (18-35 years
      of age) compared to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWP) over a period of 24
      months. Eligible participants will also be assessed for body composition, body fat
      distribution, fitness, physical activity, dietary intake, and behavioral/psychosocial
      measures that may be predictive of behavior change. Assessments will occur at 0, 6, 12, 18,
      and 24 months. Subjects will participate in a 24 month behavioral weight loss program that
      includes a reduction in energy intake and moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise
      (progressively increasing from 100 to 300 minutes per week). The technologies added to EWLI
      are text messaging, a wearable device that provides feedback on physical activity, and access
      to a website to monitor dietary behaviors.

    <description>Subjects in this group will receive our standard behavioral weight control program that is delivered in an in-person group-based format. At month 7 subjects will also be given access to a study website to monitor eating and activity behaviors, and to have electronic access to standardized intervention materials.

    <description>Subjects in this group will participate in a weight loss intervention that includes technology enhancements. These enhancements will include the addition of intervention specific targeted and tailored text messaging and the BodyMedia Fit SystemÂ® beginning at Month 7. At month 7 subjects in EWLI will also receive the same targeted study-related text messages provided to SBWP that otherwise would have been provided in paper format.</description>
