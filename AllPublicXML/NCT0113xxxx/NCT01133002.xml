      Primary Objective:

      - To obtain prospective, clinical practice-based data on how symptomatic VTE is managed with
      low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin in Canadian outpatient settings.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with symptomatic
           VTE including characteristics of VTE, VTE risk factors and bleeding risk factors.

        -  To assess the frequency of patient characteristics that would necessitate adjustment in
           the dose or duration of enoxaparin therapy, e.g. high BMI, impaired creatinine
           clearance, advanced age, cancer-associated VTE.

        -  To assess the degree of adherence in clinical practice to Consensus Guidelines
           (ACCP/American College of chest Physician 2008) for the management of acute VTE, vis a
           vis:

        -  Appropriate dosing of enoxaparin

        -  Recommended duration of initial LMWH therapy

        -  Adequate overlap of LMWH with vitamin K antagonists (VKA)

        -  Recommended duration of longterm VKA

        -  Frequency of use of LMWH monotherapy to treat cancer-related VTE

        -  To access safety outcomes (including bleeding and recurrent VTE)

        -  To describe the utilization of resources due to bleeding and recurrent VTE during the
           treatment period.
