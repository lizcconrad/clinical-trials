  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims at contributing to a valid appraisal of the magnitude of naltrexone efficacy
      as an antidissociative agent by using a double-blind randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into two groups starting with either 3 weeks of 50 mg/d naltrexone
      or with 3 weeks of placebo. In either case the active treatment phases (weeks 1-6) were
      followed by one week of placebo. The major purpose of weeks 1-2 and 4-5, respectively, was to
      achieve a steady state during the active treatment. The primary comparisons of
      psychopathology under naltrexone and placebo refer to the weeks following the intended
      achievement of a steady state (weeks 3 and 6, respectively).

      6 weeks of treatment were split into two phases: (A) 3 weeks of pharmacologically active
      treatment with naltrexone and (B) 3 weeks of pharmacologically inactive treatment with
      placebo (cross-over design). The sequence of the two treatment phases was randomized and
      concealed from both the patients and the health care professionals. In both cases, the last
      week (&quot;Week 7&quot;) was without pharmacological intervention.

      The primary outcome was based on the DSS, a reliable and valid self-rating instrument to
      assess dissociative experiences and inner tension during the last 24 hours (Stiglmayr et al.
      2001) Mean scores for intensity (ranging from 0=&quot;no&quot; to 9=&quot;very strong&quot;) and for duration
      (average time during which a particular symptom was present during the last 24 hours (in %))
      were calculated for (a) dissociation (calculated from 21 Likert type items) and of (b)
      aversive inner tension (one item).
