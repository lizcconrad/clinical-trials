        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The informed consent document and photography release must be read, signed, and dated
             by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative before conducting
             any study procedures or exams. In addition, the informed consent and photography
             release document must be signed and dated by the individual who consents the subject
             before conducting Visit 1. A photocopy of the signed informed consent document must be
             provided to the subject, and the original signed document placed in the subject's
             chart.

          -  Subjects 18 years of age or older, scheduled to undergo either a medium chemical peel
             with 35% TCA or a laser resurfacing. Subjects may be of either sex and of any race or
             skin type provided that their skin color, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not
             interfere with the study assessments.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (those who are not premenarchal, not surgically
             sterilized [hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy], or not post-menopausal) may
             participate in the study if they meet all of the following conditions:

               -  they are not breast feeding

               -  undertake a pregnancy test, which must be negative

               -  they do not intend to become pregnant during the study

               -  they are using adequate birth control methods and they agree to continue using
                  those methods for the duration of the study

        Adequate birth control methods are defined as: hormonal—topical, oral, implantable, or
        injectable contraceptives; mechanical—spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a
        condom or diaphragm; IUD; or, surgical sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active
        females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the
        subject becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use an adequate birth
        control method as described above for the remainder of the study.

        NOTE: Women who have had a bilateral tubal ligation are not considered to have been
        surgically sterilized and must agree to the conditions as specified above.

          -  Willing and able to make all required study visits.

          -  Able to follow instructions.

          -  Undergo a medium grade chemical peel or fractional resurfacing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the study medications or their
             components (e.g., balsam of Peru, castor oil, or phenoxyethanol).

          -  Therapy with another investigational agent within thirty (30) days of Visit 1, or
             during the study.

          -  Have taken anticoagulants (blood thinners, including aspirin) within two weeks.

          -  Current smoker.

          -  Use of oral isotretinoin during the past 12 months, systemic steroids, topical
             retinoids, or topical corticosteroids within the month prior to the study.

          -  Have any congenital skin disorder which affects keratinocytes, elastin, or collagen.

          -  Have any dermatologic disease which may be aggravated or provoked by the wounding
             procedure.

          -  Are at risk of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation based on personal or family
             history, or skin exam.

          -  Have any skin disorder which causes delayed healing.

          -  Have any systemic condition that would compromise skin healing.

          -  The Medical Monitor may declare any subject ineligible for a valid medical reason.
