  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dehydrated airway surfaces resulting from sodium hyperabsorption and lack of chloride
      secretion are critical to the pathology that leads to the morbidity and mortality from Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Previously published work in CF cell lines has demonstrated that
      by increasing cGMP and restoring inhibition of ENaC, sodium hyperabsorption may be reversed
      following administration of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEi,) such as sildenafil.
      Additionally it has been shown in CF cell lines and animal models, that phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors/analogues can enhance chloride secretion and/or correct surface localization of
      ΔF508 CFTR. The goal of this project is to translate the results of this work from the
      laboratory into a clinical trial in patients with CF using an FDA-approved therapy. The
      Specific Aims of this project are to: 1) Evaluate the effect of systemically administered
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors on ion transport in CF by measurement of Na+ and Cl- conductance
      by NPD and Na+ and Cl- concentration in sweat utilizing pilocarpine iontophoresis 2) To
      establish appropriate dosing of sildenafil in CF by performing a dose-escalation study during
      which patients are carefully monitored for side effects, plasma sildenafil levels are
      obtained and outcome measures are compared based on the dose of sildenafil administered. The
      results of this study in conjunction with those from an ongoing study examining the role of
      sildenafil as an anti-inflammatory in CF will aid in establishing safety, pharmacokinetics
      and mechanism of action of sildenafil in the treatment of CF lung disease.
