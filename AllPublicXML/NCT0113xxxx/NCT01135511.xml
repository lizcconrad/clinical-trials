        <title>Changes in Corneal Staining Scores for Study Eye From Baseline at Week 8</title>
        <description>Based on the National Eye Institute (NEI) dry eye clinical trials workshop, the cornea was divided into 5 different zones. Each corneal zone was graded independently using a 0 to 3 grading scale:0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Sum of scores of each zone led to total score. Total score range: 0 to 15, higher score indicated greater staining. Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change: score at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>Based on the Oxford grading system, the bulbar conjunctiva of each eye was divided into 2 different zones (nasal and temporal). The nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctival zones were each graded independently using a 6-point scale (0 [Absent] to 5 [Severe]). Total score ranged from 0 (Absent) to 10 (severe), higher score=higher damage to eyes due to dryness. Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change = scores at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Changes in Schirmer Test Values Without Anesthesia for Study Eye From Baseline</title>
        <description>The Schirmer test without anesthesia was used to estimate tear flow stimulated reflexly by insertion of a filter paper strip into the conjunctival sac. The length of wetting (distance from the notch) was recorded in millimeters (to the nearest 0.5 mm). If the wetting line was oblique, the halfway point was used.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change: value at observation minus value at baseline. Positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Increase of ≥10 mm From Baseline in Schirmer Test Value Without Anesthesia for Study Eye</title>
        <description>The Schirmer test without anesthesia was used to estimate tear flow stimulated reflexly by insertion of a filter paper strip into the conjunctival sac. The length of wetting (distance from the notch) was recorded in millimeters (to the nearest 0.5 mm). If the wetting line was oblique, the halfway point was used.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Ocular Comfort Index (OCI) Total Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The OCI is a validated instrument developed to measure the frequency and intensity of 6 common dry eye symptoms: dryness, grittiness, stinging, eye tiredness, pain, and itching. It contains 12 questions, each measured on a 7-point rating scale (0 [Never] to 6 [Always], or 0 [Never had it] to 6 [Severe]). Total score ranged from 0 (none) to 72 (severe symptoms). A higher score indicates more severe dry eye symptoms.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change: score at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

          <description>The OCI is a validated instrument developed to measure the frequency and intensity of 6 common dry eye symptoms: dryness, grittiness, stinging, eye tiredness, pain, and itching. It contains 12 questions, each measured on a 7-point rating scale (0 [Never] to 6 [Always], or 0 [Never had it] to 6 [Severe]). Total score ranged from 0 (none) to 72 (severe symptoms). A higher score indicates more severe dry eye symptoms.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change = scores at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Total Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a validated instrument for ocular surface diseases, measuring the ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers.
The 12 items of the OSDI questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0 [none of the time] to 4 [all of the time]. The total OSDI score was then calculated on the basis of the following formula: OSDI=[(sum of scores for all questions answered) × 100]/[(total number of questions answered) × 4].
The OSDI is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change: score at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Subscale Score From Baseline: Vision-Related Function</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a validated instrument for ocular surface diseases, measuring the ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers.
The 12 items of the OSDI questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0 [none of the time] to 4 [all of the time]. The subscale OSDI score was then calculated on the basis of the following formula: OSDI=[(sum of scores for questions 4 to 9 answered) × 100]/[(total number of questions 4 to 9 answered) × 4].
Thus, the OSDI is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.
Change: score at observation minus score at baseline. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Demonstrating ≥10 Unit Decrease in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Total Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a validated instrument for ocular surface diseases, measuring the ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers.
The 12 items of the OSDI questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0 [none of the time] to 4 [all of the time]. The total OSDI score was then calculated on the basis of the following formula: OSDI=[(sum of scores for all questions answered) × 100]/[(total number of questions answered) × 4].
The OSDI is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability.
Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.</description>

        <description>Based on the National Eye Institute (NEI) dry eye clinical trials workshop, the cornea was divided into 5 different zones. Each corneal zone was graded independently using a 0 to 3 grading scale. The maximum possible staining score is 15, higher score indicated greater staining.
100% Clearing of Corneal Staining means corneal staining score = 0. Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.</description>

        <description>The OCI is a validated instrument developed to measure the frequency and intensity of 6 common dry eye symptoms: dryness, grittiness, stinging, eye tiredness, pain, and itching. It contains 12 questions, each measured on a 7-point rating scale (0 [Never] to 6 [Always], or 0 [Never had it] to 6 [Severe]). Negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Results from study eye are reported. The study eye was defined as the eye with the worse (higher) corneal staining score at baseline.</description>
