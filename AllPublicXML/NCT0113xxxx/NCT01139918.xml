    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will be used to identify questions that will be part of a new QoL
      questionnaire for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to determine the sample
      size needed for its validation. The new questionnaire will be a global QoL questionnaire
      which will take into account the impact of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on QoL.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the influence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on patient's answers to
           QoL questions from DLQI, HAQ, EQ-5D, FACIT-fatigue and SF-36.

        -  To identify an equal number of questions from DLQI, HAQ, EQ-5D, FACIT-fatigue and SF-36
           where answers are mostly influenced either by psoriatic arthritis or by psoriasis.

      This study will recruit three cohorts of 40 patients each: moderate psoriatic arthritis and
      moderate psoriasis, mild psoriatic arthritis and moderate psoriasis, moderate psoriatic
      arthritis and mild psoriasis. Eligible patients will fill the following questionnaires:
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), EQ-5D,
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) and 36-Item Short
      Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). In addition, each patient will be asked on a 4
      point Likert scale how much their answer to each question is related to the impact of their
      skin disease or their psoriatic arthritis.
