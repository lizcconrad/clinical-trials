  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to develop a new method that can rapidly stage patients with gastric
      and pancreas cancer. Staging means finding out what is the extent of the cancer in a
      patient's body.

      Currently before patients have the surgery to remove their cancer, a surgical exam is done in
      the operating room to see if their cancer has spread. A thin tube-like instrument with lens
      and a light is placed into the abdomen. This is done by making small cuts into the body. This
      exam is called a diagnostic laparoscopy. If cancer spread is not seen, fluid is put into the
      abdomen and then taken out. This is called &quot;lavage&quot; or washing. The fluid is then looked at
      in a laboratory. If the fluid contains cancer cells surgery is often delayed.

      The investigators are testing a new method to put the fluid into the abdomen. It is called
      percutaneous lavage. Percutaneous means &quot;through the skin&quot;. A needle is put through the skin
      into the abdomen. Tubing is then placed over the needle so that fluid can be put into the
      abdomen and then taken out. The fluid is then looked at in a laboratory. The investigators
      want to see if the two methods are equal because if they are equal, in the future, patients
      may be able to have this procedure done outside of the operating room.

    <description>Diagnostic peritoneal lavage will be performed at the time of laparoscopy utilizing a Veress needle/Seldinger technique to insert a peritoneal dialysis catheter. This is not a new technique. The Veress needle will be inserted in the abdominal wall, at a site to be left up to the individual surgeon.</description>

    <description>The Veress needle will be inserted in the abdominal wall, at a site to be left up to the individual surgeon. Caudal traction will be applied to the abdominal wall to provide a firm abdominal wall to insert the needle through, minimizing the peritoneum from tenting down closer to visceral structures. Intraperitoneal placement of the catheter will be confirmed by injection of saline into the needle with no resistance and with the saline in the hub of the needle falling into the peritoneal cavity spontaneously. A guide wire will be placed through the Veress and utilizing the Seldinger technique, a 9Fr peritoneal catheter will be placed.</description>
