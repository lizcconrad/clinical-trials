      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet
      known whether bevacizumab is more effective when given together with paclitaxel or
      cyclophosphamide and capecitabine in treating patients with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab
      together with paclitaxel and to see how well it works compared with giving bevacizumab
      together with cyclophosphamide and capecitabine as first-line therapy in treating women with
      locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if bevacizumab and paclitaxel versus bevacizumab, metronomic
           cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine as first-line therapy causes less medication-related
           adverse events in women with HER2-negative metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent
           breast cancer.

        -  To compare quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To replicate previous findings of better QOL in patients with complete response or
           partial response versus stable disease for 6 months or greater.

        -  To determine the predictive value of baseline QOL for the duration of a meaningful
           change in QOL of patients treated with chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the associations between the QOL endpoints, selected health economics, and
           clinical endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor response
      (measurable vs evaluable disease), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and center. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
           paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, oral
           cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28, and oral capecitabine 3 times a day on days
           1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire (BL-QA) and health economics questionnaires
      (BL-HEA and EQ-5D) at baseline, during, and after completion of study therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
