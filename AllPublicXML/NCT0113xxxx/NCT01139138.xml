      This study will assess the safety of panitumumab, irinotecan and everolimus when given in
      combination to treat advanced colorectal cancer

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label uncontrolled phase IB/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and assess the efficacy of everolimus, irinotecan and panitumumab when given in
      combination for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS wild-type (WT). Patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that have failed fluorouracil based first line
      therapy will be included. It is anticipated that approximately 50 patients will be enrolled
      over a period of 24 months
