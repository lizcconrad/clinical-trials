  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control study tested the feasibility of two communication enhancement
      interventions: one with veterans who had a stroke and demonstrated poorly controlled
      hypertension; the other with VA primary care providers who provided routine outpatient
      medical care to these veterans. This study intervened with both members of the
      provider-patient dyad in an attempt to improve the self-management of hypertension by
      improving communication during visits to the VA outpatient clinic, specifically by enabling
      veterans to communicate their questions and concerns about chronic disease self-management to
      their providers more effectively, and to help providers improve their ability to communicate
      more effectively with this population of veterans.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The communication intervention had two goals; (a) coaching to enhance veteran's abilities to
      communicate their questions and concerns about self-management for hypertension to their
      physician; and (b) improving provider's communication skills for enhancing and encouraging
      self-management of hypertension.

      A health educator met with each participating veteran in the intervention arm prior to the
      2nd visit to develop a plan for enhancing communication about self-management of
      hypertension.

      The PI provided the Four Habits communication training to the 5 primary care providers in the
      intervention arm. Two clinic visits between each participating provider-patient pair were
      videotaped and coded.

      This project had a goal of enrolling 10 VA primary care providers to participate in the
      randomized control trial and 30 veterans (3 veterans from the panel of each of the 10
      participating providers) who had a stroke and now demonstrated poorly controlled
      hypertension. The study evaluated the difference between the two groups, and compared the
      content of the provider-patient conversations around hypertension management.

    <description>Veteran self-management of hypertension measured via the 13-item, (0-100 point range), Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Administered at baseline (1st visit) and after each additional follow-up visit during the next 12-months (+2 max). Rasch conversion changed raw scores to the PAM interval measure. Reported outcome is difference in mean PAM scores at baseline and during 12-month follow-up. If a participant had two PAM scores during the follow-up period, the average of the two was taken to calculate a combined follow-up score. Higher PAM scores represent higher levels of self-activation. Research on the PAM measure indicates that each point increase in PAM score correlates to a 2% decrease in hospitalization and a 2% increase in medication adherence. Ranges for Baseline PAM scores: Intervention = 46.1 (min) to 84.3 (max); Control = 43.2 (min) to 77 (max). Ranges for Follow-up PAM scores: Intervention = 48.4 (min) to 100 (max); Control = 45.1 (min) to 80.1 (max).</description>

    <description>Veterans enrolled in the &quot;Intervention-Veterans&quot; arm received a copy of the NIA guide for &quot;Talking with Your Doctor&quot; [Informational Guide for Patients]. Just prior to their next scheduled visit an educator met with each Veteran in the intervention arm individually for 20-30 minutes to review the material in the pamphlet and develop a plan for enhancing communication about self-management of hypertension with their doctor [Educational Coaching]. To facilitate communication change, the educator assisted the patient in setting a goal to achieve during their visit. The educator also provided telephone follow-up within 24 hours to review satisfaction and effectiveness of the visit and assess barriers and facilitators to communicating about self-management.</description>

        <title>Patient Activation Measure</title>
        <description>Veteran self-management of hypertension measured via the 13-item, (0-100 point range), Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Administered at baseline (1st visit) and after each additional follow-up visit during the next 12-months (+2 max). Rasch conversion changed raw scores to the PAM interval measure. Reported outcome is difference in mean PAM scores at baseline and during 12-month follow-up. If a participant had two PAM scores during the follow-up period, the average of the two was taken to calculate a combined follow-up score. Higher PAM scores represent higher levels of self-activation. Research on the PAM measure indicates that each point increase in PAM score correlates to a 2% decrease in hospitalization and a 2% increase in medication adherence. Ranges for Baseline PAM scores: Intervention = 46.1 (min) to 84.3 (max); Control = 43.2 (min) to 77 (max). Ranges for Follow-up PAM scores: Intervention = 48.4 (min) to 100 (max); Control = 45.1 (min) to 80.1 (max).</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Veterans participating in CHOICE study randomized to two arms: intervention or attention control. The 13-item Patient Activation Measure was administered at baseline and up to two additional times during the following 12 months. Rasch conversion of the raw PAM scores was performed to ensure the final scores were linear and interval measures.</population>

            <description>Veterans randomized to the intervention group received a copy of the NIA guide for “Talking with Your Doctor.” Just prior to their next scheduled visit, an educator met with each Veteran in the intervention arm individually for 20-30 minutes to review the material in the pamphlet and develop a plan for enhancing communication about self-management of hypertension with their doctor. Additional information was provided on how to be an active participant in the health care encounter and how to communicate effectively to promote productive self-management. To facilitate communication change, the educator assisted the Veteran in setting a goal to achieve during their visit. The educator also provided telephone follow-up within 24 hours to review satisfaction and effectiveness of the visit and assess barriers and facilitators to communicating about self-management.</description>
