      -  Background: Fasting is mandatory for safety of anesthesia in elective surgery and
           imaging but gives rise to discomfort, hunger and thirst especially in children.
           Internationally accepted fasting times are often prolonged because of organisational
           delay in operating theatre.

        -  Hypothesis: Clear fluids can be ingested until an imaginary anesthesia induction time
           without enlarging the residual gastric contents compared to overnight fast. There is no
           difference between residual gastric contents after 4 hours of fasting after a light meal
           compare to 6 hours in healthy children.

        -  Examination of gastric volume using magnetic resonance imaging after overnight fasting
           and subsequent scans after either clear fluid intake or intake of a standard breakfast
           are performed in children aged 6 - 12 years. Time course after fluid intake is followed
           with scans every half hour for 2 hours. In the breakfast group 4 versus 6 hours fasting
           time will be simulated, e. g. intake of clear fluid is allowed for 2 versus 4 hours
           after the meal. Volume of gastric contents will be compared with a standardized
           ultrasonographic view of the stomach.
