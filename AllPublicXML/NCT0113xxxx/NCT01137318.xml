  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel sequenced combination of a promising,
      computerized cognitive training program targeting working memory (WM) deficits in children
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in combination with behavioral parent
      training, a well-established, evidence-based intervention for ADHD.

      The combined active intervention, compared to the combined control intervention will result
      in improvement in primary psychosocial (i.e., parent/teacher reported child impairment;
      parental stress; parenting behavior; and observed child academic achievement) and psychiatric
      (parent/teacher rated ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms; observed activity level and attention)
      outcomes at post-treatment and follow up assessment, with the combined active intervention
      resulting in greater improvements in these outcomes.

    <measure>ADHD Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale: ADHD symptoms will be measured using the Disruptive Behavior Disorders rating scale (DBD) administered to the child's parent and teacher. The DBD is a 45-item measure that asks parents to rate the DSM symptoms of ADHD, ODD, and CD on a four point Likert scale (i.e., Not at all, Just a little, Pretty Much, or Very Much). For this study, the average scores for DSM-IV Inattentive symptoms, DSM-IV Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms, DSM-IV ODD symptoms, and DSM-IV CD symptoms will be used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Parent and teacher ratings of problem severity and need for treatment in important functional domains will be measured using the Impairment Rating Scale (IRS). The IRS measures impairment across domains of functioning as well as overall need for treatment. Parents and teachers place an &quot;x&quot; on a seven-point visual analogue scale to signify their child's functioning along a continuum of impairment that ranges from zero (Not a problem at all. Definitely does not need treatment or special services.) to six (Extreme problem. Definitely needs treatment and special services).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Academic Achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Wide Range Achievement Test 4 Progress Monitoring Version [WRAT4-PMV]is an adaptation of the WRAT4 and is specifically designed to be a reliable and efficient tool for monitoring the academic progress of students in Grades K-12 and college. A series of brief 15-item tests are offered in 4 areas of basic skills: word reading, sentence comprehension, spelling, and mathematics computation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ODD symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale: ODD symptoms will be measured using the Disruptive Behavior Disorders rating scale (DBD) administered to the child's parent and teacher. The DBD is a 45-item measure that asks parents to rate the DSM symptoms of ADHD, ODD, and CD on a four point Likert scale (i.e., Not at all, Just a little, Pretty Much, or Very Much). For this study, the average scores for DSM-IV Inattentive symptoms, DSM-IV Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms, DSM-IV ODD symptoms, and DSM-IV CD symptoms will be used.</description>

    <measure>Motor Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Solid-state actigraph: Motor activity will be recorded throughout the assessment using two solid-state actigraphs that store data on the number of movements per unit time. Actigraphs will be worn on the waist and non-dominant ankle. Assessments of activity level taken during structured test-sessions in children are reliable and yield measures that are correlated with parent and teacher ratings of hyperactivity</description>

    <measure>Inattention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A-X Continuous Performance Test CPT214: This CPT runs on a computer and generates objective measures of inattention and impulsivity. Letters are presented individually for 200 msec., with a 1.5 sec. interstimulus interval. The child responds when he sees an &quot;A&quot; followed by an &quot;X&quot;. A total of 400 letters are presented and the entire task lasts approximately 12 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Alabama Parenting Questionnaire: The Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) is a 42-item measure of parenting that asks parents to rate different domains of parenting on a five-point scale ranging from one (never) to five (always). The APQ can be divided into six scales: Involvement, Positive Parenting, Poor Monitoring/Supervision, Inconsistent Discipline, Corporal Punishment, and an Other Discipline Practices Scale.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). To gather information concerning the degree of and types of stress attributed to parenting, each parent will complete the PSI-SF. The PSI-SF is a direct derivative of the full-length test and consists of a 36-item self-scoring questionnaire/profile. It yields a Total Stress score from 3 scales: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child</description>
