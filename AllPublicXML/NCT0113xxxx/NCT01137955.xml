  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease is a condition in which the small intestine is damaged by gluten, the storage
      protein of wheat and similar proteins in barley and rye. The disease can cause different
      symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain and weight loss. The majority of patients
      respond to a gluten-free diet. However some patients (5-30%) have persistent symptoms and are
      considered to be poor responders to the diet. Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine
      accounts for some of the refractory patients.

      This study seeks to determine if antibiotic therapy with rifaximin relieves the symptoms of
      patients who are poorly responsive to a gluten-free diet and whether this impacts their
      breath test results.

      A symptom questionnaire will be administered at study initiation, 2 weeks and 12 weeks.
      Patients will undergo a breath test which involves drinking a sugar (lactulose) solution and
      breathing into a machine. This technique will identify the presence of bacteria in the small
      intestine. They will be randomly selected to receive either an antibiotic (rifaximin) or
      placebo three times a day for 10 days to treat their bacterial overgrowth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients age 18 or older

          -  Biopsy proven celiac disease

          -  Persistent symptoms of diarrhea, gas, bloating and/or cramping despite a gluten free
             diet for at least 1 month

          -  Women that are not pregnant or lactating can be included. All women must have a
             documented negative pregnancy test at the initiation of the study. Women who become
             pregnant during the study will be asked to discontinue the study drug and will be
             followed up until the outcome of pregnancy is known. Women of child bearing potential
             must be practicing an effective method of birth control (eg: prescription oral
             contraceptive, contraceptive injections, intra-uterine device, double barrier method,
             contraceptive patch, male sterilization) before entry and throughout the treatment
             period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. antibiotic use for any indication within preceding one month

          2. use of bismuth compounds within preceding month

          3. concomitant use of pancreatic supplements

          4. concomitant use of antispasmodics

          5. concomitant use of immunomodulators such as corticosteroids, budesonide, alkylating
             agents and antimetabolites.

          6. concomitant use of probiotics

          7. concomitant use of prokinetic agents

          8. concomitant use of 5HT3 antagonists, 5HT4 agonists

          9. concomitant use of antimotility agents (e.g loperamide)

         10. concomitant use of antidiarrheal agents

         11. diagnosed microscopic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease

         12. other causes of malabsorption: pancreatic insufficiency, giardiasis and enteropathy
             associated with T cell lymphoma.

         13. other diseases: renal or hepatic insufficiency.

         14. pregnant patients and lactating females. In addition women of child bearing age will
             be excluded if they are not using one of the methods of contraception like oral
             contraceptives, IUD and double barrier methods.

         15. patients with tuberculosis or a positive PPD test and infection with other
             mycobaterial diseases.

         16. allergy and/or potential emergence of drug resistance to rifampicin and rafamycin
             compounds.
