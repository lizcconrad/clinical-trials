      A phase I study to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and to evaluate
      pharmacokinetic, safety/tolerability and efficacy profiles of antroquinonol (Hocena®) in
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects refractory to conventional treatment modalities

      1. Antroquinonol, a novel cyclohexenone compound, is a purified compound from extract of
           Antrodia camphorata.

        2. The pharmacological effects of antroquinonol were postulated to exert its
           antitumorigenesis effects through interactions to primary targets of epidermal growth
           factor receptor (EGFR)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

        3. In vivo study in NOD/SCID mice with A549 subcutaneous xenografts consistently showed
           tumor growth suppression after 2 weeks of oral 30 and 60 mg/kg antroquinonol treatment.

    <measure>To Determind the Maximum Tolerable Dose for Antroquinonol</measure>
    <time_frame>DLT is to be observed during 4 week period</time_frame>
    <description>The study design consisted of 2 phases, the accelerated titration phase and the standard titration phase.
During the accelerated titration phase, patients were enrolled in a cohort of 1 new patient for each dose level and treated for 4 weeks at that level. Any DLT or instance of MT during any 4 week treatment at any dose level led to the initiation of standard titration (3+3) phase.
If none of the first 3 patients experienced any DLT, then dose escalation proceeded for the next cohort of patients. If 1 of 3 patients developed DLT, the cohort was expanded to at most 6 patients (another 3 patients added subsequently). If exactly 1 of the 6 patients experienced DLT, then escalation to the next dose level occurred. If more than 1 patient developed DLT in any dose cohort, the dose escalation was withheld and the prior dose level was considered as the MTD unless the present dose level was level 1</description>

A maximum of 36 patients were planned based on a criteria of a maximum of 6 patients per cohort: 1 to 6 patients were planned for each dose group in the accelerated phase; 3 to 6 patients for each dose group in the standard phase .
The method of dose escalation in the accelerated titration phase continued to the next higher dose level until a patient experienced MT or a DLT. Standard titration phase start with 3+3 patients. Dose escalation proceeded sequentially between cohorts.</description>

        <title>To Determind the Maximum Tolerable Dose for Antroquinonol</title>
        <description>The study design consisted of 2 phases, the accelerated titration phase and the standard titration phase.
During the accelerated titration phase, patients were enrolled in a cohort of 1 new patient for each dose level and treated for 4 weeks at that level. Any DLT or instance of MT during any 4 week treatment at any dose level led to the initiation of standard titration (3+3) phase.
If none of the first 3 patients experienced any DLT, then dose escalation proceeded for the next cohort of patients. If 1 of 3 patients developed DLT, the cohort was expanded to at most 6 patients (another 3 patients added subsequently). If exactly 1 of the 6 patients experienced DLT, then escalation to the next dose level occurred. If more than 1 patient developed DLT in any dose cohort, the dose escalation was withheld and the prior dose level was considered as the MTD unless the present dose level was level 1</description>
