      Aims: During the last decades overweight/obesity has increased markedly. They are associated
      with a high risk for diabetes and death. Effective intervention is mandatory. Following
      participation in treatment programmes children/adolescents often fail to reach sufficient
      long-term weight reduction. The present trial aims to integrate telemedical support in
      therapy to improve long term outcome.

      Methods: All children/adolescents with overweight/obesity were included (n=66,age 13.9±2.6
      years, body mass index [BMI] 31.2±5.4kg/m², body mass index standard deviation score
      [BMI-SDS] 2.41±0.6) admitted to our hospital 04-03/2009. To asses physical activity and
      eating habits electronic health technology was used (Fraunhofer-Institute). The system
      consists in a motion sensor integrated in a mobile phone(DiaTrace). The system analyses kind,
      intensity and duration of physical activity and eating habits.
