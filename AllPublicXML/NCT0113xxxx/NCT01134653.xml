    <textblock>
      Acute ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries, accounting for an
      estimated 2 million injuries per year and 20% of all sports injuries in the United States.
      Ankle sprains can lead to prolonged periods of pain, difficulty with mobility, and lost work
      or play time. Current best practice guidelines for treatment of an acute ankle sprain are
      protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation (PRICE). However recent systematic reviews
      for ankle sprains call into question this treatment. Two critical components; immobilization
      and ice, have little or no evidence of efficacy for ankle sprain. Interestingly, mobilization
      appears to be more effective at reducing the pain, swelling and stiffness of musculoskeletal
      injuries including ankle sprains. Historically the limitation to early mobilization has been
      pain. Recently developed stretch bands have been introduced to the therapy market as a tool
      that allows pain-free active and resisted ankle movement after acute ankle sprain.

      The investigators propose a double blind randomized controlled study to compare 2 ankle
      sprain treatments on their ability to speed recovery and reduce morbidities such as pain,
      swelling and weakness.
