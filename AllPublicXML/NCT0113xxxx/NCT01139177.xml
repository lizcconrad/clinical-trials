        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening

          1. Patient must be ≥ 21 years of age with life expectancy &gt; 1 year.

          2. Symptomatic leg ischemia requiring treatment of the superficial femoral and/or
             popliteal artery (Rutherford category 2-4; claudication, rest pain).

          3. Patient must be a suitable candidate for PTA and stenting.

          4. Patient is willing and able to return to the site of the investigation at the
             specified study intervals and undergo follow-up requirements.

          5. The patient or legal representative has provided written informed consent using a form
             that is reviewed and approved by the EC for the Clinical Site.

        Pre-Intervention

          1. Target lesion has ≥ 50% stenosis as demonstrated angiographically.

          2. Lesion length ≤ 15 cm.

          3. Reference vessel diameter of 5 to 6 mm.

          4. Patient has at least 1 vessel run-off prior to treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Screening

          1. The subject is pregnant or will become pregnant during the study or has any other
             condition that would preclude having x-rays. (Pre-menopausal women must have a
             negative pregnancy test within 7 days of the procedure.)

          2. Patients who have experienced a cardiovascular accident (CVA) or a myocardial
             infarction (MI) within 3 months prior to the procedure.

          3. Subject has had or plans to have a surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days
             before or after the implantation procedure of the SAMBA Stent.

          4. Existing hemorrhagic disease or coagulation problems or inability to take dual
             anti-platelet therapy.

          5. Contrast allergy that cannot be corrected with medication (e.g. steroids, etc.).

          6. Subject has other medical, social, or psychological problems that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and
             evaluations pre- and post-treatment.

          7. Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study.

        Pre-Intervention

          1. Uncorrectable severe aorto-iliac occlusive disease or severe common femoral artery
             stenosis preventing access or limiting inflow (e.g., stenosis greater than 50%).

          2. Uncorrectable occlusive disease limiting outflow (e.g., stenosis greater than 50%)

          3. Patients with previous surgery in the target vessel or stent that will be closer than
             2 cm to either edge of SAMBA Stent(s).

          4. Lack of 1 cm of healthy vessel proximal to proximal target

          5. Lack of popliteal reconstitution (at least 2 cm of normal distal popliteal).

          6. Inability to cross the lesion with a guidewire.

          7. More than 1 lesion in the same limb requiring treatment that will not be covered by
             continuous stenting.

          8. Unsuccessful balloon pre-dilation (i.e., the residual stenosis is greater than 30%).
