      Arm 1:

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending, supratherapeutic doses of
      HPN-100.

      Arm 2:

      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the effects of steady-state levels of HPN-100 metabolites (4 phenylbutyric acid
      [PBA], phenylacetic acid [PAA], and phenylacetylglutamine [PAGN]) on 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in healthy male and female subjects with the primary
      endpoint being the time-matched change from baseline in the QT interval corrected for heart
      rate (HR) based on an individual correction method (QTcI).

    <description>This study requires 4 periods. In each of the periods you will receive one of the dose groups listed below. At the completion of the study you will have participated in all 4 dose groups. The order in which you participate in each dose group will be randomly assigned.
Dose Group A: 9 mL placebo via oral syringe 3 times daily for 3 days
Dose Group B: single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on study Day 3
Dose Group C: 6 mL HPN-100 and 3 mL placebo via oral syringe 3 times daily for 3 days
Dose Group D: 9 mL HPN-100 via oral syringe 3 times daily for 3 days</description>
