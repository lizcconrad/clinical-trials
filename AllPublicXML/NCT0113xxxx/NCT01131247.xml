      Investigational Drugs:

      Ofatumumab (Azerra) + bendamustine (Trenda)

      Route of Administration:

      Intravenous (IV)

      Hypothesis:

      This study is designed to assess the toxicity and overall response rate. Ofatumumab is a
      fully human monoclonal antibody (A type of protein made in the laboratory that can bind to
      substances in the body, including tumor cells) that shows promising activity in the treatment
      of CLL as a single agent. It is thought that by combining it with Bendamustine, an FDA
      approved treatment for CLL, the effect on CLL will be greater than if Ofatumumab is given
      alone. Ofatumumab is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL.

      Participation:

      Approximately 37 relapsed/refractory CLL subjects will participate in this study over two
      years.

      Treatment Plan:

      A maximum of 6 cycles of treatment will be allowed. During day 1 of cycle 1 ofatumumab IV
      300mg will be administered. On day 1 of all cycles ofatumumab treatment will be followed by
      bendamustine IV 90mg/m2. On day 2 of all cycles, bendamustine IV 90mg/m2 will be
      administered. On day 3 of all cycles, neulasta SQ 6mg will be given. On day 8 of cycle 1 only
      patients will receive ofatumumab IV 1000mg. During cycles 2 through 6 ofatumumab 1000mg will
      be given on day 1 only.

      Follow-up:

      Patients will be followed monthly for six months, then every three months for five years then
      annually thereafter.
