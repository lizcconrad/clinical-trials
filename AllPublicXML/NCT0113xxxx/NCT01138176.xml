      A prospective randomized control trial to examine safety and effectiveness of whole body
      cooling to a rectal temperature of 33.5 C using phase changing material in neonatal
      encephalopathy. Effectiveness will be defined by examining the stability of rectal
      temperature during cooling. Monitoring of vital signs, infection screen, blood counts,
      coagulation screen, liver and renal function tests, cranial US and MR imaging will be
      performed on recruited infants to evaluate safety of cooling. EEG will be performed on day 4
      and hearing evaluation at discharge. Neurodevelopmental evaluation will be performed at 1
      year of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analyses of these trials show that therapeutic hypothermia increases survival with
      normal neurological function (pooled risk ratio of 1.53) with a number needed to treat of 8
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 5 - 17) and in survivors reduces the rates of severe disability
      and cerebral palsy. Therapeutic hypothermia is now widely offered to moderately or severely
      asphyxiated infants in high-income countries.

      The global burden of disease estimates indicate that perinatal asphyxia is a very significant
      problem in low and mid resourced settings. There are, however, several compelling reasons why
      the efficacy and safety data on therapeutic hypothermia from high-income countries cannot be
      extrapolated to neonatal units in transitional countries, such as India; in particular there
      is a lack of effective low tech servo controlled cooling equipments that can be used in these
      settings. This pilot phase II randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of phase
      changing material in providing satisfactory therapeutic hypothermia in neonatal
      encephalopathy, in a mid resource setting.
