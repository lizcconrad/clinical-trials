  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to develop a test that predicts the prognosis of IPF
      (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and which could be used to determine whether new treatments
      for IPF are likely to work.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this study are

        -  Discover and validate novel biomarkers and gene expression profiles for use in
           subsequent intervention studies in patients with IPF

        -  To prospectively validate a panel of previously published biomarkers in patients with
           well characterized idiopathic fibrosing lung disease

        -  Investigate genetic associations and epigenetic modifications which affect disease
           severity and progression

        -  Prospectively evaluate longitudinal disease behaviour in patients with IPF and NSIP with
           a view to developing composite clinical end-points for subsequent use in intervention
           studies in patients with IPF

      Biomarkers that can be used for the following purposes will be identified:

        -  Identify patients (Diagnostic)(e.g. discriminate between health and disease)

        -  Correlate with disease severity (extent of disease, staging of disease)

        -  Predict clinical progression (Prognostic)(stable vs progressive disease)

        -  Track response to therapy (Theranostic)- Predict response to known efficacious
           treatments &amp; Correlates with changes in clinical endpoints/mortality/quality of life

        -  Predict risk of exacerbations (could be used to prevent exacerbations or reduce their
           severity)

        -  Correlate with complications and/or comorbidities (e.g. biomarkers of PAH,GER in IPF,
           etc)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A diagnosis of IPF using the consensus criteria (32)and NSIP.

          -  Between the age group 18-85 years.

          -  Sub classified into Mild (TLCO&gt;60), Moderate (TLCO 40-60), Severe (TLCO&lt;40).

          -  People who volunteer to undergo a bronchoscopy for research

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People who do not have IPF/NSIP (i.e. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, Sarcoidosis)

          -  People who cannot give informed consent.

          -  People who are being considered for bronchoscopy, any contra-indication to undergoing
             this procedure as set out in the British Thoracic Society guidelines (Thorax 2001; 56:
             suppl I: i1-i21). These will be part of the study but not undergo the BAL.
