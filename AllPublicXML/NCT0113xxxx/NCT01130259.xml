  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following trial is designed to offer pre-approval drug access to iniparib in combination
      with gemcitabine and carboplatin in order to provide potential clinical benefit to patients
      with ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. This follows an ongoing Phase 3,
      multi-center, open-label, randomized study of gemcitabine/carboplatin, with or without
      iniparib, in patients with ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (protocol
      20090301).

      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.
