      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue and blood samples from patients
      with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate aberrant methylation patterns in tissue and serum samples from patients with
           early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to validate the Johns Hopkins single
           institutional study.

        -  Attempt to define subgroups of patients at greater risk for recurrent or metastatic
           disease who may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant therapeutic regimens.

        -  Develop prognostic indicators for disease-specific and overall survival.

        -  Define new potential molecular targets for therapy.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor and intrathoracic lymph node tissue samples are analyzed for aberrant
      DNA methylation (p16/CDKN2A, DAP kinase, H-cadherin, APC, and RASSF1A) by
      methylation-specific PCR. Analyses are then compared with the preliminary data from the Johns
      Hopkins institutional study.
