  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to non-invasively study the reflective changes in cardiac output
      as response to fluid therapy in the pediatric moderate hypovolemia/dehydrated pediatric
      patients using sub-q rehydration using Hylenex augmented subcutaneous infusion of fluids and
      electrolytes compared to intravenous methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, single-center Phase IV clinical trial. The study will consist of
      patients with moderate hypovolemia/dehydration requiring parenteral rehydration. It is
      expected that this study will describe the onset or change in cardiac output using Hylenex
      augmented subcutaneous rehydration from ages 2 months up to 3 years and at a flow rate
      satisfying clinical needs, especially in reference to changes in cardiac output observed in
      standard intravenous rehydration.
