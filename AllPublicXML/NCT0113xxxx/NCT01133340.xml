  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking for a better way to define rectal tumors undergoing pre-operative
      radiation. MRI scanning generally results in more clear definition of the tumor that CT
      scanning. Insertion of radio opaque clips in the tumor site could also help to visualize the
      tumor better for radiotherapy treatment planning. The investigators believe both techniques
      would help the physician to define to cancer better than using CT scan alone. The
      investigators also will compare both techniques to define the better way to define the tumor.

      1. The use of endoscopically placed mucosal metal clips to define the superior and inferior
           extent of the rectal tumor will improve the accuracy of tumor localization in patients
           undergoing non-contrast CT simulation.

        2. A 3T-MRI will provide a better localization of the rectal tumor and pelvic nodes
           compared to non-contrast CT simulation for radiotherapy treatment planning.

        3. By comparing these two novel methods to the standard procedure, we would be able to
           define any difference between the three methods and obtain an estimate of the accuracy
           and reliability of each method for the localization of the rectal tumor.

    <description>No treatment intervention is planned. Patients will be scanned and treated as per department standards. The patient will have MRI at the time of their standard plan. They will then have clips inserted to mark the tumor after the standard scan is performed. The MRI and additional imaging with clips in place will be processed by 3 investigators who will contour based on the experimental image and compare this with the standard treated plan. Comparison of volumes in a blinded manner between investigators will also occur. The patients treatment will not be affected by the MRI or clip placement.</description>
