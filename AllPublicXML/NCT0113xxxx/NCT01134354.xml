  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Design:

      Prediction trial, up to 10 sites in Asia and Europe

      Goal:

      To better understand the &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; after orthopedic trauma surgery by developing
      a model that can be applied clinically as a user-friendly &quot;baseline&quot; questionnaire - capable
      of predicting &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; based on a patient's pre-surgical expectations of their
      final outcome and to validate a novel outcomes measure (TOM).

      Primary aim:

      To assess the psychometric properties of predictive validity, internal consistency and
      reproducibility of the trauma expectation factor (TEF) in the Eurasian population.

      Secondary aim:

      To assess the psychometric properties of criterion validity, internal
      consistency,reproducibility, and sensitivity to change of the TOM in the Eurasian population.

      Key questions related to patient and surgeon expectations:

        -  How different, or similar, are patient and surgeon expectations?

        -  Do expectations change over time?

        -  Do patient expectations predict outcomes in validated measures use today?

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Isolated ankle or distal tibia fracture

          -  Scheduled for and undergoing one of the following surgeries for their fracture:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has previously undergone internal fixation surgery for this ankle/distal tibia
             fracture.

          -  Subject has disease entity, or condition that precludes likelihood of bony union
             (e.g., metastatic cancer, metabolic bone disease).

          -  Subject has severe dementia or other severe mental health problem that may preclude
             him/her from completing study questionnaires.

          -  Subject is participating in other competing clinical research that may interfere with
             participation in this research.

          -  Subject is unlikely to attend study related follow-up visits.

          -  Subject has poly-trauma (more than one organ system compromised)

          -  Subject has additional fracture(s) other than ankle fracture

          -  Subject is a prisoner

          -  Fracture occurred more than 28 days before surgery
