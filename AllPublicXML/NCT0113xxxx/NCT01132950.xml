  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase the initiation and continuation of highly effective
      contraceptive use while incarcerated and upon release, as well as decrease unsafe sexual
      activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections are important and costly public
      health problems in the United States resulting from unprotected sexual activity. Women with a
      history of incarceration are at increased risk for these problems given the high rates of
      substance abuse and commercial sex work in this population. This proposal is designed to
      evaluate an innovative intervention Motivational Interviewing with Computer Assistance (MICA)
      designed to improve contraceptive use for incarcerated women who do not want a pregnancy and
      are soon to be released into the community. The investigators will utilize the Title X
      program which, in conjunction with RI Department of Corrections (RI DOC), provides
      reproductive health services in jail and then transitional services in the community after
      release. The investigators plan to recruit 400 women from the RI DOC women's jail and
      randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of personalized MICA or two sessions of
      Didactic Educational Counseling (DEC), both delivered individually by trained counselors. The
      two counseling interventions will be similar in length and timing, but will vary in content,
      counseling style and the individualized computer generated feedback that is reviewed with the
      counselor.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contraceptive initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Initiation of a highly effective contraceptive method prior to release from jail will be limited to methods that are 98% or more effective in preventing pregnancy (Table 1).41 Initiation of these methods will be verified through review of the RI DOC medical records (as we have done in the past).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous use of highly effective contraceptives at follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>If a participant switches from one highly effective contraceptive method to another she will be recorded as maintaining continuous contraceptive use at follow-up if she switches methods during times when the original method is still effective. Use of contraceptive methods will be confirmed through both TLFB and medical record review.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incident STIs</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline participants will be tested for T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis through self obtained vaginal swabs. If a participant is diagnosed with an STI at baseline she will be treated and she will be asked to follow-up in six weeks for a test for cure. Any positive test after a baseline negative test will be documented as an incident infection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incident pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An incident pregnancy will be defined as having occurred if there is a baseline negative pregnancy test and a positive urine Beta-HCG test through the study or a self reported pregnancy confirmed with a positive urine or serum Beta-hCG test through medical record review during the time of study participation. If a participant reports a positive pregnancy test outside of the study then she will be asked to sign a release of medical information form and a copy of the test results will be obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk for unintended pregnancy and STIs</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Risk behaviors will be determined through the TLFB. No or low risk for an unintended pregnancy will include either continuous use of a highly effective contraceptive method, abstinence, or use of a condom with a spermicide during every act of intercourse. No or low risk for STIs include abstinence or use of a condom with every act of intercourse and with every partner.</description>
