  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence (9% in men and 4% in women) of sleep apnea / hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) in
      adults is now well documented as well as its cardiovascular repercussions. Previous studies
      showed a conclusive link between SAHS and severe cardiovascular diseases such as
      hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke.Then, SAHS is a public health
      issue in adults.

      In this context, early detection of such a disease is crucial if the management is tailored
      to the patient, the practitioner's choice of therapy moving towards continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular advancement device. The detection is based on full
      nocturnal polysomnography or polygraphic recordings. Polysomnography remains the gold
      standard but it is a time consuming and costly examination. Polygraphic recording is a test
      that allows simplified the diagnosis of severe patients, but may not be sufficient for mild
      form of SAHS. Thus, the SAHS is a pathology under-diagnosed and under-treated. The validation
      of a technique for identifying patients most at risk to either limit the number of
      polysomnographic examination is requested.

      In this perspective, the development of a product screening sleep related breathing disorders
      for physicians, cardiologists, internists (not specialized sleep experts) would fill this
      need. It allows for a reliable first screening for their patients in parallel with a routine
      cardiological examination. Imposing a minimal human and material, the ECG Holter recorder
      &quot;VistaO2&quot; (NOVACOR, Rueil-Malmaison, France) is a device designed to meet these requirements.
      This device fits into the daily management of patients with cardiac arrhythmias or
      sinus/atrioventricular conduction disorders, and of patients suffering myocardial infarction
      (arrhythmic risk stratification, detection of silent myocardial ischemia).

      Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has already shown interest in screening SAHS. We
      therefore wish to evaluate the performance of the analysis of data from the screening tool
      VistaO2 face what the gold standard synchronized polysomnography.
