  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting the glutamatergic system to treat depression is a new and promising strategy based
      on studies at the molecular, synaptic, and neuronal level but also on results of studies
      conducted in animal models and first clinical studies involving depressed patients.Ketamine
      has been proposed as a novel approach to induce rapid antidepressant response. In this pilot
      project the investigators aim to introduce this novel and promising approach into clinical
      practice. Besides the assessment of clinical efficacy, the investigators will put a special
      emphasis on the assessment of ketamine-associated effects on brain function using fMRI and
      cognitive testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder
             without psychotic features.

          -  Drug-resistant depressed patients (defined as non-response to two sufficiently long
             (at least 6 weeks) drug trials at the maximal authorized or tolerated dose)

          -  Score 25 or higher on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale

          -  Stable psychotropic medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers)
             during the last 6 weeks prior to inclusion.

          -  Legally competent subjects agreeing to comply with the requirements of the study and
             authorizing the transmission of relevant information to competent physicians in the
             case of a clinically relevant previously unknown finding during an MRI examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with co-morbid substance abuse or dependence during the 3 months prior to
             inclusion, except nicotine consumption.

          -  Patients judged to be at serious suicide risk (score ≥ 4 at item 10 of the MADRS).

          -  Patients with any other DSM-IV axis one diagnosis including bipolar disorder except
             for anxiety disorder which are not dominating the clinical presentation.

          -  History of psychotic symptoms.

          -  Patients with any contra-indication to the administration of ketamine, especially
             present diagnosis or antecedents of clinically relevant cardiovascular disorders
             (clinically significant or not adequately treated hypertension, present or previous
             diagnosis of cardiovascular disorder such as stroke or heart attack etc).

          -  Any MRI contraindication, especially metallic implants, pacemaker, etc.

          -  Pregnant women, breast-feeding women, women of childbearing age without effective
             means of contraception.

          -  Treatment during the last 2 weeks with thyroid hormones and sympathicomimetic drug.
