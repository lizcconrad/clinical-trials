      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to address unanswered questions about the
      relative effectiveness of treatments for children with both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) and significant reading difficulties (RD). The study evaluates attentional
      and word reading outcomes for students with both conditions when provided with either (a)
      ADHD treatment alone, (b) RD treatment alone, or (c) the combination of ADHD and RD
      treatment.

      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to address unanswered questions about the
      relative effectiveness of treatments for children with both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) and significant reading difficulties (RD). The study evaluates attentional
      and word reading outcomes for students with both conditions when provided with either (a)
      disorder-specific ADHD treatment (carefully managed medication + parent training), (b)
      disorder-specific RD treatment (intensive, individualized reading instruction), or (c) the
      combination of ADHD and RD treatment. The study aims to address the relative benefits of
      providing either disorder-specific ADHD or RD treatment alone and providing the combined
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the combined treatment approach will result in
      better outcomes in terms of both word reading/decoding and a reduction in ADHD symptoms than
      either of the disorder-specific treatments alone. Treatment will last for 16 weeks, with
      assessment prior to and following treatment and some measures collected regularly throughout
      the intervention periods.

    <measure>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills Oral Reading Fluency Subtest (DIBELS ORF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 (End of Active Treatment Phase) and Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>DIBELS ORF measures oral reading fluency in connected text. Students are presented with a passage on their grade level to read orally, and the score is the number of words of the passage read correctly in a one-minute period. Students in this study read two passages at each test administration, and the mean score for the two passages was the dependent variable analyzed. A research synthesis of studies reporting psychometric properties for DIBELS ORF determined that reliability coefficients in these studies exceeded .80 and that the measure demonstrated moderate to high concurrent and predictive validity across studies (Goffreda &amp; DiPerna, 2010).</description>

      <population>Baseline characteristics are for our final analysis sample, consisting of all children randomized to each condition except for 1 in the ADHD arm, 1 in the Reading arm, and 4 in the Combined arm, who were excluded because upon ex post-facto review of records, they did not meet either ADHD, RD, or IQ inclusion criteria and had been included in error.</population>

          <title>ADHD Treatment</title>
          <description>Carefully-managed medication and behavioral parent training. Children began with a trial of extended release methylphenidate; if there was no benefit or the side effects were intolerable, this was followed by a trial of mixed salt amphetamine. if side effects of stimulants were intolerable, atomoxetine or guanfacine could be prescribed. Parent training was nine sessions provided by a psychologist addressing ADHD and its treatment, principles of behavior modification, and evidence-supported practices for managing behavior.</description>

          <description>Specialized phonologically-based reading instruction provided by well-trained tutors either individually (one-on-one) or to groups of two students for 45 minutes, four days per week, for 16 school weeks. Instruction was explicit and systematic, with extended opportunities to practice and apply skills in connected text with feedback. Interventionists used an individualized combination of published and unpublished programs targeting word reading and decoding, reading fluency, and reading comprehension, depending on students' needs documented in ongoing assessment.</description>

        <description>Rating Scale of ADHD symptomology completed by parents and teachers. Raters evaluate how well each DSM-IV ADHD symptom describes a child on a four-point Likert scale (0=Not at all, 1=Just a little, 2=Quite a bit, 3=Very much). The measure shows adequate internal consistency (.94) and test-retest reliability (Bussing et al., 2008; Gau et al., 2008).</description>

Children began with a trial of extended release methylphenidate; if there was no benefit or the side effects were intolerable, this was followed by a trial of mixed salt amphetamine. if side effects of stimulants were intolerable, atomoxetine or guanfacine could be prescribed. Parent training was nine sessions provided by a psychologist addressing ADHD and its treatment, principles of behavior modification, and evidence-supported practices for managing behavior.</description>

        <description>The WIAT-III is an individually-administered test of academic achievement. In the Pseudoword Decoding subtest students read a list of increasingly difficult nonsense words as a test of their ability to use phonics to decode unknown words. Scores reported here are standardized scores with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills Oral Reading Fluency Subtest (DIBELS ORF)</title>
        <description>DIBELS ORF measures oral reading fluency in connected text. Students are presented with a passage on their grade level to read orally, and the score is the number of words of the passage read correctly in a one-minute period. Students in this study read two passages at each test administration, and the mean score for the two passages was the dependent variable analyzed. A research synthesis of studies reporting psychometric properties for DIBELS ORF determined that reliability coefficients in these studies exceeded .80 and that the measure demonstrated moderate to high concurrent and predictive validity across studies (Goffreda &amp; DiPerna, 2010).</description>
