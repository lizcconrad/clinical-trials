      This study will test the effect of provider to patient interactive voice response (IVR) calls
      in local Community Health Centers within a weight management program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will randomize providers to three groups. Patients whose provider has been randomized to
      usual care will not receive IVR calls but do have available a guideline-level weight
      management service in TCL. Groups one and two will receive pre-visit and post-referral calls.
      The pre-visit call will invite patients who want to discuss weight at their upcoming visit
      with their provider to remember to do so. The post-referral call will remind patients that
      they have received a referral and encourage them to schedule a visit with the community based
      weight intervention program. Patients whose provider has been randomized to group 1 will
      receive IVR calls using their scheduled and referring provider's voice. Group 2 will receive
      IVR calls using a standard IVR voice.
