      A prospective single clinical trial to validate the use of a low-dose (~5mSv) Tc-99m protocol
      with a high-efficiency cardiac dedicated camera (Dynamic Single Photon Emission Computed
      Tomgraphy; D-SPECT) to detect myocardial perfusion abnormalities during myocardial perfusion
      imaging.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Summed Rest Score is a standard measure used to quantify myocardial perfusion on nuclear imaging, which takes an integer value between 0 and 68. Summed Rest Score will be compared between standard dose and low-dose protocols. Summed Rest Score will be assessed on the same day in each patient using both standard dose and low-dose protocols. Thus, two Summed rest scores will be obtained for each patient using images obtained on the same day and compared.</description>

    <description>The study is designed to assess the validity of a low dose (~5mSv) Tc99m one day protocol using D-SPECT standard protocol as the comparators.
D-SPECT cardiac scanner the D-SPECT system uses a solid-state detector, made of an alloy of Cadmium, Zinc, and Telluride, eliminating the need for thick crystals and large photomultiplier tubes. As a result, the system is significantly miniaturized, and ergonomically optimized to both user and patient</description>
