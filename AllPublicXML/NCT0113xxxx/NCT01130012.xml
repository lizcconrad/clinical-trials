  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)is a major health problem

        -  growing prevalence of obesity

        -  the older age of pregnant women

      A randomized controlled trial in 54 pregnant voluntary women at high risk for GDM.

        -  feasibility of an early intervention

        -  glucose tolerance at weeks 26-28
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at weeks 8-12

             1. voluntary women in early pregnancy (n=96)

             2. 54 high risk mothers were randomized

                  -  lifestyle intervention group (n=27)

                  -  close follow-up (n=27)

        2. An OGTT was performed again at weeks 26-28

             -  the lifestyle intervention group (n=27)

             -  the close follow-up group (n=27)

             -  other high-risk women of the early care group (n=42)who were not randomized

        3. An OGTT was also performed at weeks 26-28 in two neighboring municipalities

             -  a standard care high-risk group(n=171)who did not undergo early intervention

        4. Primary outcomes

             -  number of at risk participants developing GDM during pregnancy in the two arms

        5. Secondary outcomes

             -  the effect of intervention on fetal growth
