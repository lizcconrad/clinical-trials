  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel design, double-blind study of mometasone furoate
      (MF) in pediatric subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis. The subjects 5 to 15 years of
      age with perennial allergic rhinitis will enter a no-treatment observation period of 7 days
      at minimum and eligibility for inclusion in this study will be assessed. Following the
      observation period, eligible subjects will be randomized to MF or MF placebo for a 2-week
      double-blind treatment. At each clinic visit (at the start of treatment and after 1 and 2
      weeks of treatment or at discontinuation), nasal symptom scores, nasal findings, and adverse
      events (AEs), will be evaluated. A 30-day follow-up visit will take place after the
      completion (or discontinuation) of the 2-week treatment period, to confirm presence or
      absence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and trial procedure-related AEs.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score at 1 Week</title>
        <description>Total nasal symptom score was a composite of 4 symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching), each symptom was scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. The total score ranged from 0 to 12. The higher the score was, the more severe the symptoms were.</description>
