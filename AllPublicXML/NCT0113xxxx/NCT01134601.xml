  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The investigational anti-cancer drug AZD6244 prevents a protein found in rectal cancer from
      working properly, which may slow tumor growth and allow radiation and chemotherapy treatments
      to destroy more cancer cells. Researchers are interested in determining whether AZD6244 can
      be used to improve treatment outcomes in individuals who have rectal cancer that has spread
      outside the rectum into the surrounding pelvis.

      Objectives:

      - To determine safe and effective doses of AZD6244, along with radiation and chemotherapy, to
      treat rectal cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with rectal cancer that has
      spread outside the inner wall of the rectum or into lymph nodes in the pelvis.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will be screened with a physical examination, blood and tumor
           samples, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will receive AZD6244 twice a day by mouth for 1 full week (7 days) before
           starting radiation and chemotherapy and every week thereafter until the end of the
           radiation and chemotherapy treatment.

        -  Participants will have radiation therapy daily, 5 days per week, for approximately 6
           weeks.

        -  Participants will receive chemotherapy (capecitabine) twice daily, 5 days per week, for
           approximately 6 weeks.

        -  Approximately 4 to 8 weeks after completing the AZD6244, radiation, and chemotherapy
           treatment, participants may have surgery to remove any tumors and affected lymph nodes.
           This surgery is not part of the treatment delivered on this protocol.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up exam 3 weeks after the end of treatment, every 3
           months for the first year, and then in the second and third year after the end of
           treatment. These visits will involve a full medical examination and imaging studies.

      Background:

        -  Local recurrences of rectal cancer are morbid and difficult to manage effectively.

        -  Colorectal cancers frequently harbor RAS mutations and EGF/EGFR over-expression.

        -  AZD6244 is an orally available selective, adenosine triphosphate uncompetitive inhibitor
           of MEK1/2 that sensitizes tumor cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo.

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To define the maximum tolerable dose of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate delivered BID, 7 days per
           week, in combination with radiation therapy (RT) and Capecitabine in patients with
           locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum without distant metastases.

        -  To define the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile associated with
           administration of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate delivered BID, 7 days per week in combination with
           RT and Capecitabine

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 delivered alone and in combination with
           Capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) PO BID.

        -  To obtain exploratory information regarding the pathologic response rate obtained after
           treatment with the MTD of AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate in combination with Capecitabine and 50.4
           Gy of RT.

        -  To determine if changes in phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells correlates to changes in pERK in rectal tumors in the setting of treatment with
           AZD6244.

        -  To perform an exploratory analysis to determine if the presence of activating mutations
           in RAS or BRAF in tumor or changes in plasma transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha)
           levels and tumor pERK/total ERK with AZD6244 treatment alone and after AZD6244 in
           combination with Capecitabine and RT predicts for down staging or pathologic response.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, non-metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the rectum (clinical stage T3AnyN, T4AnyN, or AnyTN+).

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

        -  Normal organ and marrow function.

      Design:

        -  All patients will receive 50.4 Gy of RT to the pelvis and rectal tumor delivered
           concurrently with Capecitabine and AZD6244. AZD6244 will be delivered BID daily, 7 days
           per week, in a dose escalated fashion. AZD6244 will begin one week prior to Capecitabine
           and RT and will conclude on the last day of Capecitabine and RT.

        -  Capecitabine will be delivered at 825 mg/m(2) PO every 12 hours, 5 days per week,
           starting on the first day of RT and continuing until the last day of RT.

        -  Biopsies of tumor tissue will be obtained prior to treatment, after one week of AZD6244,
           and after one week of AZD6244, RT, and Capecitabine for correlative assays.
