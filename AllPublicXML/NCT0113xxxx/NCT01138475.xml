      Evaluate the efficacy of paricalcitol, cholecalciferol, and placebo in the reduction of
      parathyroid hormone in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Assess
      changes, if any, in measures of self-assessed well-being attributable to paricalcitol after
      RYGB. Evaluate the rates of hypercalcemia, kidney stones, gastrointestinal side effects, and
      other organ system adverse effects of paricalcitol, cholecalciferol, and placebo in patients
      after RYGB

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of paricalcitol capsules, cholecalciferol capsules, and placebo on serum PTH levels after a 6-week trial in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism after GB surgery. We enrolled 49 subjects (16, 17, and 16 in the paricalcitriol, cholecalciferol, and placebo groups, respectively).
Consenting adult participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each treatment group and received paricalcitol capsules, cholecalciferol capsules, or placebo. Per inclusion criteria, all had previously undergone GB for the treatment of morbid obesity, were between 6 weeks and 5 years post-surgery with secondary hyperparathyroidism, defined as a serum PTH level greater than 69 pg/mL.</description>

            <title>Placebo-controlled</title>
            <description>The placebo group received a placebo capsule, 1 daily each day of the week. This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of paricalcitol capsules, cholecalciferol capsules, and placebo on serum PTH levels after a 6-week trial in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism after GB surgery. We enrolled 49 subjects (16, 17, and 16 in the paricalcitriol, cholecalciferol, and placebo groups, respectively).
Consenting adult participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each treatment group and received paricalcitol capsules, cholecalciferol capsules, or placebo. Per inclusion criteria, all had previously undergone GB for the treatment of morbid obesity, were between 6 weeks and 5 years post-surgery with secondary hyperparathyroidism, defined as a serum PTH level greater than 69 pg/mL.</description>
