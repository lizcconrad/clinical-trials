  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is becoming a major procedure, owing to smaller incisions, shorter
      hospitalizations, and less post-operative pain as compared with traditional laparotomies.
      However, there is marked interindividual variability of post-operative shoulder-tip pain
      following laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of shoulder pain varies from 35% to 80% and
      ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, it has been reported to last more than 72 hours
      after surgery.

      The hypothesis of post-operative shoulder-tip pain is that carbon dioxide induced phrenic
      nerve irritation causes referred pain to C4. Therefore, the investigators should try to
      reduce carbon dioxide retention in the pelvic cavity.

    <description>We will follow the patients in the first 48 hours after the surgery. The primary outcome measure of this trial is the severity and frequency of shoulder-tip pain after laparoscopic surgery.
The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of clinical maneuver to reduce shoulder-tip pain after laparoscopic surgery.</description>
