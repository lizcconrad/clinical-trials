    <textblock>
      Patients in the ICU are already predisposed to nosocomial infections, which are both costly
      and potentially life threatening, and it appears that the immune paralysis of sepsis may put
      these patients at greater risk for secondary infections, though this has not been proven
      conclusively. One measure of this sepsis-induced immune suppression is monocyte deactivation.
      The investigators hypothesize that, as a cornerstone of the monocytic innate immune response
      to infection, the inflammasome is critical to monocyte function during sepsis.

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to a severe infection. Despite the high incidence
      and societal costs of sepsis, the mechanism by which it kills remains unclear. The
      pathophysiology of sepsis is not completely understood, but many investigators now believe
      that sepsis induces a prolonged state of immune suppression. This study will attempt to
      quantify the degree of immune suppression during the first 5 days of sepsis by measuring the
      immune function of peripheral blood monocytes and the inflammasome constituent proteins in
      peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. â‰¥ 18 years.

          2. Have consensus criteria for sepsis (infection plus two of four systemic inflammatory
             response syndrome [SIRS] signs [tachycardia, tachypnea, fever or hypothermia,
             leukocytosis or leukopenia]) and a known or suspected infection for SEPTIC arm.

               -  Patients without criteria for sepsis will be eligible for CONTROL arm. Patient
                  must consent to have blood drawn within 24 hours of initiation of mechanical
                  ventilation (for CONTROL arm) and 24 hours of new episode of sepsis to be
                  eligible (for SEPTIC arm).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Consent not available or declined

          2. Prisoner

          3. Died before blood collected

          4. Onset of sepsis more than 24 hours prior to transfer to OSUMC,mechanical ventilation
             greater than 24 hours

          5. Anticipation of less than 24 hours of mechanical ventilation by primary team

          6. Women who are pregnant.
