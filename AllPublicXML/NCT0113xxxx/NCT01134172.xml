  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how being treated for breast cancer affects
      patients' employment, financial situation, and quality of life on a short-term basis and on a
      longterm basis. Most studies of employment after breast cancer have focused on Caucasian
      women.This study will evaluate the impact of breast cancer on the lives of women from
      different ethnic groups.
