    <textblock>
      The regime in the aftercare after total hip and knee arthroplasty(THA/TKA) differs a lot
      between orthopedic surgeons concerning weight bearing. The type of implant and the way of
      implants' anchoring are considered.

      In the literature there is no data so far about the way patient take care of the recommended
      weight bearing during the first 6 weeks after THA and TKA.

      Over a one year period starting August 2010 all patients undergoing TKA or THA at the
      investigators institution will have a technical device in their shoes (sole) to measure the
      load in each step they do in these shoes during the first 6 weeks. Patients are asked to fill
      out a standardised pain protocol every day (VAS) and document need of pain medication. The
      investigators recommend 20kg of weight on the operated leg for 6 weeks and full weight
      bearing at the end of week six.

      The investigators believe that patients will adjust weight bearing to their level of pain and
      not to their surgeons recommendations.
