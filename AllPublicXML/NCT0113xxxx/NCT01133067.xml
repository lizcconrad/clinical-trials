      Does the routine clinical practice of follow up after primary treatment in lung cancer
      patients has any utility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients of cancer, after their primary treatment are subsequently called for follow up
      visits to assess the disease status. This has two important implications from the point of
      view of resource management. One, patients often have to travel long distances to report to
      the hospital and have to take care of other logistics such as their accommodation, local
      travel and food. Further often the patient travels with 1-2 attendants which adds to the
      logistic burden. Also, these patients of follow up also contribute to the load on existing
      hospital services. Many authors have speculated that follow-up visits generate anxiety about
      possible disease recurrence. On the other hand, many others have suggested that although
      there may be a transient increase in anxiety, patients are ultimately reassured by this
      practice. Hence, there is no firm evidence for the practice and the need for follow up in
      oncology care.
