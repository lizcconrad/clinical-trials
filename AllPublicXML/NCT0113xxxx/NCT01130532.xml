    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate if treatment with tadalafil once daily will allow
      men to return to normal erectile function in those who did not have normal erectile function
      following as-needed (PRN) Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) Inhibitor treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Having an International Index of Erectile Function - Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) Domain Score Greater Than or Equal to 26 Through 12-Week Endpoint (Double-Blind Treatment Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. Data presented are the percentage of participants who return to normal erectile function (IIEF-EF domain score ≥26) at end of double-blind treatment period (Period III).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in the International Index of Erectile Function - Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model included centered-baseline as a covariate and factors of study, treatment group, and pooled site within study, and centered-baseline-by-treatment-group interaction.</description>

    <description>Self-reported intercourse satisfaction over the past 4 weeks. IIEF-IS is the sum of Questions 6, 7 and 8 of the IIEF. Scores range from 0 (low/no satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction) for each question, with the total possible score for the 3 questions of 0 to 15. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

IIEF-OS is the sum of Questions 13 and 14; each question scored as 1 (low/no satisfaction) through 5 (high satisfaction) with total subscore for the 2 questions of 2 to 10. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model included centered-baseline as a covariate and factors of study, treatment group, and pooled site within study, and centered-baseline-by-treatment-group interaction.</description>

        <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. Data presented are the percentage of participants who return to normal erectile function (IIEF-EF domain score ≥26) at end of double-blind treatment period (Period III).</description>

        <description>Self-reported overall satisfaction over the past 4 weeks. IIEF-OS is the sum of Questions 13 and 14; each question scored as 1 (low/no satisfaction) through 5 (high satisfaction) with total subscore for the 2 questions of 2 to 10. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model included centered-baseline as a covariate and factors of study, treatment group, and pooled site within study, and centered-baseline-by-treatment-group interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in Treatment Satisfaction Scale (TSS) - Patient</title>
        <description>The TSS measured participant satisfaction with treatment based on a 13-item questionnaire. The overall score for each of five TSS domains (confidence to complete sexual activity, ease of erection, pleasure from sexual activity, erectile function satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm) was converted to a 0-100 scale with higher numbers on the scale indicating greater satisfaction. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model included centered-baseline as a covariate and factors of study, treatment group, and pooled site within study, and centered-baseline-by-treatment-group interaction.</description>

        <description>The TSS - patient satisfaction with medication measured participant satisfaction with treatment based on a 13-item questionnaire. The overall score was converted to a 0-100 scale with higher numbers on the scale indicating greater satisfaction. Satisfaction with medication was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANOVA).

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Scale (TSS) – Partner Satisfaction With Medication Score at Week 12 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The TSS - partner satisfaction with medication measured participant's partner satisfaction with treatment based on a 13-item questionnaire. The overall score was converted to a 0-100 scale with higher numbers on the scale indicating greater satisfaction. Satisfaction with medication was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANOVA). The model included factors of study, treatment group, and pooled site within study.</description>

        <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30.

        <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function.</description>
