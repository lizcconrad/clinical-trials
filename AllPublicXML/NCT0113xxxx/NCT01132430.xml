  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high burden of asthma appears to be related to poor asthma control, which is associated
      with more frequent asthma symptoms, greater bronchodilator use and functional impairment, and
      worse pulmonary function. Despite the availability of effective treatments, more than 58% of
      asthmatics are poorly controlled. Daily adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) regimens is
      considered by experts to be one of the most important behavioral factors linked to achieving
      optimal asthma control. However, there is a paucity of research on interventions specifically
      designed to improve ICS adherence among adult asthmatics. The vast majority of intervention
      studies to date used atheoretical interventions to target behavior change, relying mainly
      upon educational approaches which have been criticised for &quot;failing to translate knowledge
      into action.&quot; This may be due to the fact that most education-based approaches do not
      specifically address or help patients overcome ambivalence about behavior change, which is
      necessary for ensuring daily adherence. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a client-centred
      intervention that focuses on enhancing intrinsic motivation to change a particular behavior,
      and exploring and resolving ambivalence about behavior change. Brief MI sessions (e.g., 1-5 x
      15-30 minute sessions) have been shown to improve a variety of health behaviors (e.g., reduce
      alcohol consumption, improve dietary habits, increase exercise behaviour, and improve
      medication adherence) and health outcomes (reduce blood pressure, body mass index, and
      cholesterol levels). However, no studies to date have assessed the efficacy of using MI to
      improve ICS adherence in asthmatics. This study aims to assess the efficacy of using MI to
      improve daily medication (ICS) adherence in a sample of poorly controlled, non-adherent
      asthmatics. It is hypothesized that patients randomized to the MI condition will exhibit
      significantly improved ICS adherence at 6 and 12-months post-intervention, independent of
      baseline levels and covariates, relative to patients randomized to the usual care control
      condition.
