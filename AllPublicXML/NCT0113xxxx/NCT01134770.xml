  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand the biology and behavior of early mother-infant
      attachment, and to investigate how it may be affected by prenatal substance exposures. The
      investigators are interested in how drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, marijuana and cigarette
      smoking affect both mother and baby.

      The investigators are looking for pregnant women or mothers with their newborn infants to
      participate in this study. Eligible women include mothers who have used any of the following
      drugs at any time during pregnancy (alone or in combination):

        1. cocaine

        2. nicotine (cigarettes)

        3. marijuana

        4. alcohol

      The investigators are also looking for mothers who have not used any drugs during pregnancy.

      Information collected in this research study is strictly confidential, and protection of
      sensitive information is additionally assured by an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality.

      Participation in this study involves:

        1. One visit at 2-4 weeks postpartum. This visit includes an interview for mother and a 30
           minute brain scan (no radiation, no sedation) for baby.

        2. Two visits at 3 months postpartum. Mothers will have blood pressure and heart rate
           measured while they look at videos about babies, listen to baby sounds, interact with
           their own baby. Samples of blood, urine and saliva will be taken from mother. Baby will
           have a developmental assessment, and saliva samples will be taken.

      Payment is $300 or the equivalent in Walmart gift cards for completion of brain imaging, lab
      visits and 1 day of monitoring mother's blood pressure at home.
