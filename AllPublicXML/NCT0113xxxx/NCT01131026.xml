  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, although the triple treatment with clarithromycin accepted as the primary treatment
      for Helicobacter pylori infection eradication is well tolerated, the eradication has been
      decreased to 65 %. However, the eradication resulting from TRIOL treatment with levofloxacin
      is expected to be 75 % or higher. If the target results can be reached, it will be concluded
      that TRIOL treatment with levofloxacin will be an alternative to the triple treatment with
      clarithromycin as the primary treatment.

      The primary end point in this study is appointed to be &quot;Helicobacter pylori infection
      eradication with TRIOL treatment&quot; and the secondary end point as &quot;safety&quot;. The study involves
      the investigation of the efficacy and safety of the triple treatment consisting of 500 mg
      levofloxacin, 1000 mg amoxicillin and 30 mg lansoprazole on Helicobacter pylori eradication
      in 60 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.
