    <textblock>
      This is a Five cohort sequential clinical trial for subjects with recurrent ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer to determine the feasibility and safety as well
      as immunogenicity of OC-DC, an autologous vaccine comprised of autologous dendritic cells
      (DC) loaded in vitro with lysate from autologous oxidized tumor cells, administered
      intranodally alone, or in combination with intravenous Bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide or in
      combination with intravenous Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide and aspirin. Study duration is 24
      months.

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days of last vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be established by grading the observed toxicities using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version3.0). All toxicities observed within 30 days of last vaccination will be included.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response</measure>
    <description>Clinical Response will be determined by RECIST criteria. Response rate is the proportion of patients that achieve CR or PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose limiting toxicity</measure>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as: any Grade 3 or higher allergic, autoimmune or injection site reaction or any Grade 4 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity (except fever).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune Response Immune Response</measure>
    <description>Immune response will be evaluated by IFN-g ELISPOT analysis of tumor-reactive T cells, and in HLAA2+ subjects, by tetramer analysis of Her-2 specific T cells in peripheral blood. Response is defined by a 3 fold increase relative to pre-vaccination.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Subject has recurrent ovarian (including low malignant potential),
        fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

          -  Subject has had prior cytoreductive surgery yielding tumor for lysate preparation.

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject has an ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1.

          -  Subject must understand and sign the study specific informed consent.

          -  Subject may have received chemotherapy or other therapy after harvest of tumor and
             prior to enrollment. Subjects who have achieved complete response following
             chemotherapy are still eligible for participation

          -  Subject is platinum-sensitive (progression-free interval ≥ 6 months prior to recent
             recurrence) or platinum-resistant (progression-free interval &lt; 6 months prior to
             recent recurrence).

          -  Subject has recovered from toxicities of prior chemotherapy or other therapy (to grade
             2 or less).

          -  Subject may have received prior investigational therapy (including immune therapy).

          -  Subject may have received prior hormonal therapy.

             have completed such therapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has had at least 4 weeks of postoperative recovery from surgery prior to
             enrollment to ensure complete wound healing. Subjects with bowel resections at surgery
             who enroll in cohort 2 will begin protocol at least 42 days after surgery if debulking
             surgery had comprised of bowel resection or other bowel surgery.

          -  Subjects who screen fails can be re-enrolled if the causation of the screen fail has
             been corrected.
