    <measure>Change in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) From Baseline to the Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The peak expiratory flow rate is the maximal rate that a person can exhale during a short maximal expiratory effort after a full inspiration. Baseline was calculated using the mean of the data recorded during the last 7 days of the run-in period, and the treatment period average was calculated as the mean of all available data recorded during the entire treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose assessment value measured at randomization (Visit 3), and the treatment period average was calculated as the mean of all available data recorded during the entire treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Evening PEF From Baseline to the Treatment Period Average</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is the total volume of air expired after a full inspiration. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose assessment value measured at randomization (Visit 3), and the treatment period average was calculated as the mean of all available data recorded during the entire treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Mid-expiratory Flow Between 25% and 75% of the FVC (FEF25-75) From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEF25-75 is the average rate of airflow during the midportion of the forced vital capacity. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose assessment value measured at randomization (Visit 3), and the treatment period average was calculated as the mean of all available data recorded during the entire treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Daily and Daytime Asthma Symptom Scores From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients, with the help of their caregiver, were required to rate and document their asthma symptoms twice daily as an overall symptom score for the time period since their previous recording. The following rating scales were used: 0 = None; no symptoms of asthma; 1 = Mild symptoms; awareness of asthma symptoms and/or signs that are easily tolerated; 2 = Moderate symptoms, asthma symptoms with some discomfort, causing some interference with daily activities or sleep; 3 = Severe symptoms; incapacitating asthma symptoms and/or signs, with inability to perform daily activities or to sleep.</description>

    <measure>Change in Nighttime Asthma Symptom Score From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients, with the help of their caregiver, were required to rate and document their asthma symptoms twice daily as an overall symptom score for the time period since their previous recording. The following rating scales were used: 0 = None; no symptoms of asthma; 1 = Mild symptoms; awareness of asthma symptoms and/or signs that are easily tolerated; 2 = Moderate symptoms, asthma symptoms with some discomfort, causing some interference with daily activities or sleep; 3 = Severe symptoms; incapacitating asthma symptoms and/or signs, with inability to perform daily activities or to sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nighttime Awakenings and Nighttime Awakenings With Reliever Medication Use From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients, with the help of their caregiver, were asked to respond to a standard question each morning as they completed their eDiary. The question to be answered was, &quot;Did your asthma cause you to wake-up last night?&quot; If yes, patients were asked, &quot;Did you need to use your reliever medication (albuterol/salbutamol inhaler) before you went back to sleep?&quot; Baseline is defined as the percentage of days where patient experienced nighttime awakenings out of all available days where data was collected during the last 7 days of the run-in period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Daily and Daytime Reliever Medication Use From Baseline to Treatment Period Average</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient, with the help of their caregiver, recorded the number of inhalations of reliever medication used, for relief of asthma symptoms, twice daily in the eDiary. Patients were asked to respond to a standard question twice daily (morning and evening). The question to be answered was, &quot;How many albuterol/salbutamol inhalations since last diary entry?&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Withdrawals Due to Pre-defined Asthma Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were considered to have experienced a &quot;pre-defined asthma event&quot; if any of the following conditions were met during the study: 1. At each visit or follow-up visit, a decrease in morning pre-dose FEV1 &gt;=20% from the Visit 3 (randomization visit) morning pre-dose FEV1 or a decrease to &lt;65% of predicted normal value; 2. The use of &gt;=8 actuations of albuterol/salbutamol per day on 3 or more days within any period of 7 consecutive days following randomization; 3. A decrease in morning PEF &gt;=20% from baseline on 3 or more days within any period of 7 consecutive days after randomization; 4. Two or more nights with an awakening due to asthma, which required the use of reliever medication within any period of 7 consecutive days after randomization; 5. A clinical exacerbation requiring emergency treatment, hospitalization, or use of an asthma medication not allowed by the study protocol.</description>

        <description>Patients were considered to have experienced a “pre-defined asthma event” if any of the following conditions were met during the study: 1. At each visit or follow-up visit, a decrease in morning pre-dose FEV1 &gt;=20% from the Visit 3 (randomization visit) morning pre-dose FEV1 or a decrease to &lt;65% of predicted normal value; 2. The use of &gt;=8 actuations of albuterol/salbutamol per day on 3 or more days within any period of 7 consecutive days following randomization; 3. A decrease in morning PEF &gt;=20% from baseline on 3 or more days within any period of 7 consecutive days after randomization; 4. Two or more nights with an awakening due to asthma, which required the use of reliever medication within any period of 7 consecutive days after randomization; 5. A clinical exacerbation requiring emergency treatment, hospitalization, or use of an asthma medication not allowed by the study protocol.</description>
