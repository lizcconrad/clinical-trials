  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine, at 3 years of life, how the neurologic and
      functional outcomes in infants with single ventricles are different when comparing children
      treated with the Hybrid strategy to the Norwood strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurologic deficits in children with single ventricle physiology are believed to be
      associated with the reconstruction of the aortic arch during the initial Norwood procedure as
      a neonate. In the last few years, a new management strategy (the 'Hybrid' strategy) has been
      proposed which defers the aortic arch reconstruction to a second stage procedure at 4-6
      months of age.

      Proponents of the Hybrid strategy assert that the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass and
      circulatory arrest in the neonatal period will avoid neurologic injury in the critical
      neonatal period and thereby result in superior long-term neurologic outcomes.

      We are testing whether the Hybrid management strategy is associated with superior neurologic
      outcomes or not.

    <description>Hybrid palliation will be performed as per current clinical practice at The Hospital for Sick Children.
The 'Hybrid' management strategy utilizes catheter-based and non-open heart surgical procedures in the neonatal period to stabilize the neonate.10 The majority of the reconstruction is thereby deferred to 4-6 months of age, at which time the second stage procedure including an aortic arch reconstruction is performed. The third stage procedure (Fontan) is identical between Norwood and Hybrid strategies.</description>
