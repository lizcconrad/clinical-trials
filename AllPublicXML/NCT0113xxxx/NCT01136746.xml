  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the use of insulin glargine plus insulin lispro to
      human regular insulin for treatment of hyperglycemia in the hospital setting in patients
      without known prior history of diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a comparison of 2 methods for administering subcutaneous insulin therapy
      to non-critically ill adult patients with hyperglycemia and without known history of diabetes
      who are admitted to non-intensive care unit (ICU) general medical hospital services.
      Basal-bolus therapy, considered the gold standard for glucose control in patients with known
      diabetes, will be compared with sliding scale insulin, a commonly used method of glucose
      control (prevailing standard practice) in hospitalized patients. In this study, basal-bolus
      therapy will consist of once-daily glargine plus lispro 3 to 4 times daily adjusted to
      achieve pre-meal capillary plasma glucose &lt;140 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and bedtime
      capillary plasma glucose &lt;180 mg/dL for patients who are eating [predose plasma glucose &lt;140
      mg/dL for patients with nil per os (NPO) orders]; sliding scale insulin will be administered
      using human regular insulin 4 times daily as needed adjusted to achieve predose capillary
      plasma glucose target &lt;140 mg/dL in patients who are eating or have NPO orders.
