  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The substantial range of individual responsiveness to plant sterols has important
      ramifications. Marked differences across individuals in particular aspects of the cholesterol
      metabolic pathway must alter the impact of plant sterol consumption. As such, a pronounced
      need exists to understand the genetic and metabolic factors that explain the substantial
      degree of heterogeneity in response of lipid concentrations to plant sterols across
      individuals. The primary focus of this trial is to delineate the impact of differing
      cholesterol synthesis levels on response of LDL-C and other plasma lipids to plant sterol
      consumption. Participants pre-identified as high or low endogenous cholesterol synthesizers,
      according to their screening level of lathosterol to cholesterol ratios, will be given PS or
      a placebo containing margarine to consume under supervision for 4 weeks in a crossover
      design. The trial will characterize the responsiveness of the participants' total, LDL, and
      HDL cholesterol, as well as triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations, to plant sterol consumption.
      This research will determine if cholesterol synthesis phenotype predicts the responsiveness
      of lipids to plant sterol consumption. Variations in candidate genes involved in cholesterol
      metabolism will also be investigated in order to find associations with both cholesterol
      metabolism phenotypes and responsiveness of lipids to plant sterols. The output of this
      research will be to advance the knowledge of which genetic factors influence the degree of
      cardiovascular benefit derived from plant sterols through lipid lowering.

    <measure>Cholesterol synthesis measurement by deuterium incorporation</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (Day 27,28) of each experimental period</time_frame>
    <description>Cholesterol biosynthesis will be determined as the rate of incorporation of deuterium from body water into red blood cell membrane free cholesterol over a 24 hour period (day 27 to day 28 of each period). The change in deuterium enrichment within red blood cell free cholesterol will be determined as an index of synthesis, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of cholesterol.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in cholesterol absorption from control period (measured over days 24-28) to plant sterol period (days 24-28)</time_frame>
    <description>Ninety-six hours before the end of each period, participants will ingest 65 mg [3, 4-13C]-cholesterol. The 13C-cholesterol will be dissolved in 5 g of warmed margarine, and consumed on a slice of bread. A fasted blood sample will be taken at baseline on day 24 prior to isotope administration, as well as fasting samples on days 25, 26, 27 and 28 to monitor enrichment levels of 13C-cholesterol in plasma total cholesterol. The area under the curve of 13C-cholesterol from 0-96 hours (days 24-28) at the end of the control period will be compared to the same area under the curve at the end of the plant sterol period to determine the change in cholesterol absorption due to plant sterol consumption.</description>
