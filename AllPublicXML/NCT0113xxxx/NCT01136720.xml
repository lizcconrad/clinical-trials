  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDG produced in the MIRC NS has a similar safety profile to the same compound utilized
      elsewhere in that no significant adverse events will occur during observation of the patients
      for 2 1/2 hours post injection of the tracer. It is also hypothesized that as this FDG
      produced by similar methodology and its quality assurance assessed as in another
      jurisdictions will have similar performance parameters in patients with focal lung pathology
      to that previously determined.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) utilizing 18F-FDG is a nuclear medicine imaging technique
      evaluating glucose related metabolic processes providing information not obtainable from
      anatomic imaging . 18F-FDG PET scanning is used clinically in most developed countries and
      Canadian jurisdictions primarily in oncology patients and also in assessing myocardial
      viability and some neurological conditions.

      The functional information obtained from 18F-FDG PET has been demonstrated to have a
      significant impact on patient management in oncology.1 It is used to provide accurate
      pre-treatment staging, aid in planning of therapy, monitoring response to therapy, restaging,
      providing assessment of recurrence after curative therapy and in radiation treatment
      planning.

      Patients with severe ischemic heart disease and secondary myocardial dysfunction pose
      difficult management decisions in terms of surgical vs. medical management. Assessment of
      viable myocardium is integral in this decision and 18F-FDG PET has been shown one of the most
      effective non-invasive methods in this evaluation.

      18F-FDG PET has been shown very effective in neurology differentiating dementia types and in
      patients with epilepsy in whom surgical treatment is being considered.

      The Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) PET/CT program has operated since June, 2008 and
      to date has examined over 2000 patients utilizing Health Canada approved 18F-FDG produced by
      Pharmalogic in Montreal. A significant component of the PET Program infrastructure in Nova
      Scotia is the Medical Imaging and Research Centre (MIRC NS) including a GMP grade
      radiopharmaceutical production lab and cyclotron. This CTA will allow evaluation of 18F-FDG
      produced at the MIRC-NS in a similar case load to prove its clinical utility and safety.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical efficacy will be analyzed in the patients with focal lung pathology. The clinical course of these patients will be followed to determine the true nature of these focal lesions with the gold standard being pathologic evaluation from either surgical procedure or biopsy results. In patients whom pathology is not made available, assessment of the lesion nature will be determined by other clinical indicators in consultation with the managing physicians opinion based upon these factors and the patient's clinical course.</description>
