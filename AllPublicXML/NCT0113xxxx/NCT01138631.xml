  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve success rate by assisted reproductive techniques new techniques are being
      developed for selection of the embryo with best chance of implantation, establishement of
      pregnancy and subsequent delivery.The present study is based upon the hypothesis that
      time-lapse (frequent imaging) may give information about important steps in embryonic
      development, which could help to optimize selection of embryo(s) for treatment in IVF. The
      present study evaluates the outcome of conventional embryo culture with culture in a
      specially developed incubator equipped with a time-lapse system (Embryoscope).

      Embryos from 50 IVF cycles (400 embryos) will be randomised to either conventional incubation
      or to culture in the Embryoscope. Embryos will be cultured for five days to the blastocyst
      stage. The primary endpoint is fraction of embryos developed to the four cell stage.

    <textblock>
      In vitro fertilization for infertility has a success rate on average in Europe of 25% in
      terms of baby take-home rate per cycle. One way to improve this rather low succes rate is to
      develop new measures for selection of the best embryo among peers as presently evaluated by
      embryo morphology. One of these promising methods is contineous imaging of embryo development
      by time-lapse. A new and unique equipment for this purpose - an Embryoscope - har been
      developed by Unisense Fertilitech. The present study evaluates embryo 4-cell rate during
      cultivation to blastocyst stage in a conventional incubator with 4-cell rate in the
      Embryoscope to ensure non-inferiority of the latter.
