      RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA from patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin may help
      doctors learn more about the effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on cells. It may also help
      doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in DNA samples from younger patients with
      newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To analyze candidate-coding polymorphisms in CD33 of DNA samples from children with
           newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin on
           COG-AAML03P1.

        -  To determine the association between these polymorphisms and clinical response of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for candidate polymorphisms in CD33 by PCR-based
      sequencing.
