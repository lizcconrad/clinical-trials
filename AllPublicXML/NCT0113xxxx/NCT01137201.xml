      To see if closing the mesenteric defects created at a Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass is better
      than leaving them open.

      When the patients who has undergone a Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass lose weight, the mesenteric
      defects that are inevitable to cause, gets bigger and can cause an internal hernia (IH). This
      study will observe whether it is better to close the defects or leave them open. The patients
      will be randomized into two groups. One, where the defects are closed with sutures and one
      where the defects are left alone. The primary endpoint of the study is the prevalence of
      surgery for obstruction. Information about this will be gathered through the national
      register for obesity surgery in Sweden, SOReg. Each arm in the study will include 1200
      patients and the follow up period will be three years. Since the register mentioned above is
      an ongoing register, the results can be studied over a longer period if wanted. The national
      hospital registry will further improve the follow-up.
