  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most deadly types of cancer and the leading cause of death in
      cancer in Sweden. Five year survival is 10% in men and 15% in women. Approximately 3300
      individuals in Sweden are diagnosed each year and the incidence of adenocarcinoma is
      increasing. Lung cancer patients are to a great extent currently being diagnosed by
      exfoliative cytology. However, new drugs leading to more personalized treatments will demand
      more specific classification of tumour types. Today EGFR mutation status is becoming an
      important factor when deciding treatment strategy for patients with Non-Small Cell Lung
      cancer.

      Sufficient tumour material must be available if EGFR mutation status is to be tested. Core
      needle biopsy is one way to obtain the quantity of material needed when testing mutation
      status. The portion of patients having core needle biopsies is believed to vary greatly
      between hospitals in Sweden, a difference from 20% to 70 % have been assumed, but is not yet
      confirmed in studies. This study will investigate the current situation and procedures when
      patients are diagnosed with lung cancer. The results can be used to describe any possible
      adverse events connected to the procedure and possibly contribute to development of a better
      decision tool to be used when deciding if a core needle biopsy is to be performed or not.

      More and more therapeutical targets having similar problems are likely to be developed in the
      future. An investigation of current quality and procedures when diagnosing lung cancer by
      biopsies will facilitate future diagnosing of lung cancer and ensure that personalized
      treatments can be offered to patients.
