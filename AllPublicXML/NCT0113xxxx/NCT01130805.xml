    <textblock>
      In order to improve survival of metastatic gastric cancer patients, we plan to to conduct a
      phase II trial of CapeOx with 800 mg once-daily pazopanib as a first-line chemotherapy in
      metastatic gastric cancer patients.

      Despite improvements in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer, many patients present with
      inoperable disease and an effective, novel combination treatment is urgently needed for these
      patients population. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy improves survival
      for patients with advanced gastric cancer compared with best supportive care alone [hazard
      ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.52] and that combination chemotherapy is
      superior to monotherapy (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93) (Wagner et al., 2006). For advanced
      gastric cancer, 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (FP regimen) is commonly used reference
      regimen, which are successfully replaced by capecitabine and oxaliplatin in recent phase III
      trial (Cunningham et al., 2008; Okines et al., 2009). In phase II trial, CAPEOX (capecitabine
      combined with oxaliplatin) regimen also showed promising activity for the metastatic gastric
      cancer (Park et al., 2006; Park et al., 2008). In order to improve survival of metastatic
      gastric cancer patients, various clinical trials incorporated novel molecularly targeted
      agent in combination with the reference arm.
