  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, we intend to demonstrate that a great portion of women at high risk
      (inadequate screening, HPV 16/18 and/or cytology) are presenting to the ED, cytology/ HPV
      testing via ThinPrep®Pap testTM and surveillance. We intend to provide improved access to
      healthcare and monitoring through administration of vaccine to eligible patients and 1 year
      follow up for patients involved in this study.

      Females meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria participating in the study (n=100) that have not
      had a cytology test in 2 or more years will be offered the Thin Prep® cytology test. This
      study will allow surveillance of disease through cytology and HPV DNA testing via collection
      of data using Thin Prep® cytology with reflex HPV DNA testing according to established
      guidelines as described below.

      Provide improved access to healthcare and monitoring through administration of vaccine for
      eligible females as established by guidelines. Patients will receive first vaccine in the ED
      and will have arranged follow up for administration of the 2 month and 6 month series of the
      HPV vaccination. Through data collection, we intend to determine if there is a need for
      vaccination and determine if patients are likely to follow up..
