  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Services for people with personality disorders are challenged by how to engage clients in
      therapy. High non-completion rates have major cost-efficiency implications, but more worrying
      is that drop-out may be associated with negative outcomes for clients. The investigators have
      developed a motivational intervention that helps people focus on their valued and attainable
      life goals and consider how therapy could help with goal attainment.One way to improve
      retention in treatment is to deliver pre-therapy motivational preparation interviews. The
      primary aim of our proposed research is to gather information to determine whether a
      randomised controlled trial of a goal-based motivational intervention is feasible in a
      community personality disorder treatment service.

      The investigators aim to work with community adults with personality disorder. Referrals to
      Nottinghamshire NHS Trust's community personality disorder service will be eligible for
      inclusion. After initial assessment for suitability for the service, patients will be
      randomised to receive the motivational interview plus treatment as usual or treatment as
      usual only. The investigators aim to recruit 100 participants over 1Â½ years. The comparison
      is between a motivational intervention called the Personal Concerns Inventory plus treatment
      as usual and and treatment as usual only in the client preparation phase. The feasibility
      measures are (1) the recruitment rate to a goal-based motivational interview plus treatment
      as usual or treatment as usual only, and (2) the acceptability of the intervention to clients
      and therapists. The investigators will also develop measures to assess the processes by which
      the intervention may have an effect, and assess the cost of the intervention compared with
      treatment as usual.
