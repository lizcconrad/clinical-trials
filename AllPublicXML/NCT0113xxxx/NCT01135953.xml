  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      tDCS has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression. However, tDCS is a
      relatively new clinical tool and more needs to be understood about its use. This study hopes
      to further the field of knowledge by examining how tDCS should be optimally used. Application
      of tDCS in clinical trials of depression is typically to the prefrontal cortex, but in this
      project, tDCS application will be to the motor cortex as it provides a more ready measure of
      excitability. Excitability will be measured using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to
      the motor cortex and electromyography (EMG) recordings from peripheral muscles stimulated.
      Using a cross-over three-arm design this study aims to investigate whether daily tDCS
      administered in increasing intensity across sessions leads to greater and lasting effects on
      brain excitability than keeping the intensity at a same dose across the days and whether the
      excitatory effect could be enhanced with D-cycloserine, a medication known to prolong the
      excitatory effects of a single session of tDCS. This in turn will inform on how to optimize
      tDCS for therapeutic applications, e.g treatment of depression. The study hypothesis is that
      5 sessions of tDCS with a dose of D-cycloserine given on the Monday and Thursday sessions
      will result in more sustained effect on motor cortex excitability than 5 sessions of tDCS
      alone. The second hypothesis is that the gradational increases in tDCS intensity over 5
      sessions will result in greater motor cortex excitability than 5 sessions of tDCS where
      intensity is kept constant across sessions.
