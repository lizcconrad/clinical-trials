  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of lapatinib plus paclitaxel to
      evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy in Japanese patients with ErbB2 over expressing
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib 1500mg/day will be administered in
      combination with paclitaxel 80mg/m2/week. Lapatinib and paclitaxel will be administered until
      disease progression or withdrawal from the study due to unacceptable toxicity.

      The study will proceed in two phases. The first phase (Phase I part) will lead to evaluate
      safety and tolerability of lapatinib taken together with paclitaxel in the first 6 subjects.
      Pharmacokinetic profile also will be evaluated as the secondary objects.

      Then the study will move to the next treatment phase (Phase II part) to evaluate further
      safety and clinical activity, if no major safety concerns are raised during Phase I part. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate overall survival (OS), and the secondary
      objectives are Objective tumour response rate (ORR), Duration of response, Time to response,
      Clinical benefit and Progression-free survival (PFS) in 12 subjects.

      This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase I/II study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of weekly paclitaxel and lapatinib in subjects with ErbB2-overexpressing
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior therapy for metastatic
      disease. These subjects will receive weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV for 3 weeks in a 4 week
      cycle) plus lapatinib (1500 mg once daily). Subjects will receive a daily dose of lapatinib
      until disease progression or withdrawal from study treatment due to unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent. Subjects will be treated with paclitaxel for standard of 6 cycles, and
      may be continued at the discretion of investigators. If the subject experiences progression,
      an unacceptable toxicity related to paclitaxel, or termination of lapatinib therapy,
      paclitaxel therapy must be terminated any time of study period, even before 6 cycles of
      paclitaxel are given.

      This study consists of the Phase I and Phase II parts:

      Phase I part

      Tolerability and pharmacokinetics in 6 subjects will be evaluated in Phase I part of study
      and the tolerability criteria are set as follow:

      Tolerability criteria in first cycle; Concerning the safety tolerability of this trial, if 1
      out of 6 first enrolled subjects meets the tolerability criteria, the study will proceed to
      phase II part and the regimen will judged as well tolerable. If 2 subjects meet the
      tolerability criteria, the sponsor will consult the safety review committee. GSK will finally
      judge based on the consultation regarding the tolerability and the medical significance.

      Grade 4 hematologic toxicities. Thrombocytopenia less than or equal to 25,000/mm3 Grade 3 or
      4 and clinically significant non-haematologic toxicities. Inability to start cycle 2 within 2
      weeks of scheduled dosing due to unresolved toxicity.

      For all 6 subjects enrolled, safety profiles occurred in cycle 1 are closely monitored
      individually. When considering the appropriateness of study continuation, not only the safety
      profiles noted in cycle 1 of this study, but also the safety profiles reported from pilot
      part of EGF104578 study and other relevant studies will be referred in order to make medical
      decisions.

      Phase II part After tolerability in 6 subjects enrolled in Phase I part is confirmed, further
      6 subjects to be enrolled for Phase II part (i.e. total of 12 subjects). Subjects will
      receive a daily dose of lapatinib until disease progression or withdrawal from study
      treatment due to unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. All 12 subjects will be
      followed for survival.

        <description>Time to response is defined as the time from the start of treatment until first documented evidence of partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) (whichever status is recorded first). Analysis was based on responses confirmed at a repeat assessment made at least 4 weeks after the initial response, with the time to response taken as the first time the response was observed. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum LD. Baseline measurements were obtained at the Screening Visit.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR or a PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occured earlier). The analysis was based on responses as evaluated by the investigator and was confirmed at a repeat assessment, with the duration of response taken from the first time the response was observed. CR is defined as the disappearance of all TLs and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum LD. Baseline measurements were obtained at the Screening Visit.</description>

        <description>Best OR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progressive disease (PD)/death as assessed by the investigator. CR is defined as the disappearance of all TLs and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum LD. Baseline measurements were obtained at the Screening Visit. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions compared to the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Any participant who could not be classified by the four preceding definitions was considered Not evaluable.</description>
