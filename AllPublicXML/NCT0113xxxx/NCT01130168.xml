    <textblock>
      This study will test the relationship between CBP (central blood pressure) and PBP
      (peripheral blood pressure) effects after single and multiple doses of Isosorbide mononitrate
      extended release (ISMN ER) or Amlodipine besylate in participants with hypertension.

    <measure>Time-weighted Average (TWA) Change From Baseline (0 Hours) to 12 Hours in Heart-Rate-Corrected Augmentation Index (AIx) After A Single Dose of Treatment</measure>

    <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is the ratio of augmented aortic pressure (Δ P) to central pulse pressure expressed as a percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. Single dose effects on AIx were estimated as a time-weighted average change from baseline over the 12-hour post single dose observation period. Because heart rate (HR) affects AIx, AIx was corrected to a HR of 75 beats per minute (bpm) as follows:
HR-corrected AIx = -0.39 x (75 - HR) + AIx. This value was used for all AIx analyses.</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Average (TWA) Change From Baseline (0 Hours) to 12 Hours in Heart-Rate-Corrected Augmentation Index (AIx) After A Single Dose of Treatment</title>
        <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is the ratio of augmented aortic pressure (Δ P) to central pulse pressure expressed as a percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. Single dose effects on AIx were estimated as a time-weighted average change from baseline over the 12-hour post single dose observation period. Because heart rate (HR) affects AIx, AIx was corrected to a HR of 75 beats per minute (bpm) as follows:
HR-corrected AIx = -0.39 x (75 - HR) + AIx. This value was used for all AIx analyses.</description>
