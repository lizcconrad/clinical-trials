      Although the patients with schizophrenia can be treated with new generation of antipsychotics
      medication, additional approaches are necessary to improve schizophrenics' cognitive
      functions, interpersonal relationships as well as social adjustment. When some of patients
      return to community, they expose to practical pressure that contribute to worsen and relapse
      of disease. That further damages patient's cognitive functions. Integrated Psychological
      Therapy(IPT) on treating schizophrenia has dramatic improvement in recent years; it has
      formed structured treatment gradually on relieving illusion, hallucination as well as
      negative symptoms. This study aims at conducting 12-week structured IPT group therapy. The
      intended subjects are patients, met with DSM-â…£-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, from community,
      outpatient and inpatient service. The overall treatments are designed to provide 1-2 hours
      weekly group therapy which focuses on relieving illusions, hallucination, and negative
      symptoms. Patients' cognitive functions, ability of emotional adjustment and interpersonal
      relationship would be evaluated in pre-test and post-test to indicate whether the significant
      difference exists. There is a controlled group, in which patients who still receive treatment
      as usual (TAU). The study also compares the evaluation results between IPT group and TAU
      group, hoping to develop the therapeutic framework for Taiwan people with schizophrenia.
