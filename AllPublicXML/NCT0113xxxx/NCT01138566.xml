  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To estimate the prevalence of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and/or AmpC among
           Enterobacteriaceae which cause community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs)

        2. To collect the background, risk factors and clinical outcome of patients with
           community-acquired uropathogenic condition related to Enterobacteriaceae (both ESBL,
           AmpC- and non ESBL and/or AmpC producing) after receive different antibiotic regimens.

        3. To develop a scoring system to early identify patients at risk of being infected with
           ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae by comparing the risk factors for
           community-onset UTIs caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC-positive against non ESBL -and/or AmpC
           Enterobacteriaceae

        4. To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ertapenem for the empiric treatment of
           community-onset UTIs in patients at risk for ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing organism.

      The study hypothesis (i) Patients infected with community-acquired uropathogenic ESBL- and/or
      AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae who receive regimens other than carbapenems have a worse
      outcome.

      (ii) There are certain risk factors predicting the acquisition of community-onset UTIs caused
      by ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

      (iii) The use of ertapenem is an effective and safe empirical therapy compared with other
      agents for community-onset UTIs caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

             of community-onset UTI caused by Enterobacteriaceae will be eligible for inclusion in

          -  complete obstruction of the urinary tract,

          -  peri-nephritic or intrarenal abscess, prostatitis, any rapidly progressive disease or
             terminal illness,

          -  immuno-compromising illness or immuno suppression therapy, the need for concomitant
             antimicrobials in addition to study therapy,

          -  a baseline pathogen resistant to study drug,

          -  treatment with a systemic antimicrobial agent for &gt;24 h within 72 h prior to
             enrolment, or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm3.

          -  Men with a history or physical findings suggestive of acute or chronic prostatitis
             will also excluded.
