  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety of Yulex gloves when used by individuals who have
      documented allergy to natural rubber latex from Hevea brasiliensis. Yulex is a latex from a
      different plant (Guayule) and in previous studies shows no cross-reactivity to Hevea latex
      and has not been allergenic in workers exposed to Yulex. The FDA has approved Yulex gloves
      for use in the general population and has recognized and labeled these gloves as Hevea
      Latex-free. The labeling still includes a precaution that Yulex gloves may pose a risk for
      development of allergy because Yulex does contain a small amount of Guayule protein. Yulex
      Corporation has proposed doing further studies to demonstrate safety and lack of
      allergenicity in a population that is prone to latex allergy. In the proposed pilot study,
      the investigators goal is to complete the protocol on 10 adults with spina bifida who are
      allergic to natural rubber latex who will wear Yulex gloves as part of their regular bladder
      and bowel care for approximately 30 minutes daily over a 3 month period. The investigators
      anticipate that the investigators will need to recruit and enroll up to 50 study participants
      to achieve a final sample of 10 adults with complete study data. Individuals with a history
      of anaphylaxis will be excluded from the study. The study participants will be tested for
      Yulex allergy by Glove Puncture Test as well as serology at the beginning and end of the
      study. The FDA Devices group has reviewed the study design and agreed that this is a suitable
      first pilot study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from July 2009 until May 2010. Only 7 participants were enrolled. None of the participants completed the study. Funding was never received from the study sponsor, so the study was terminated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 7 individuals who enrolled in the study, 2 passed screening and were found to be latex allergic. Funding was never received from the study sponsor and the study was terminated. The 3 month trial of Yulex gloves was not started with any of the participants, so no intervention data is available.</pre_assignment_details>
