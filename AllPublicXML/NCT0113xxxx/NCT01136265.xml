  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to pre-operatively scan patients who do not have any
      clinically suspicion of metastases with an 18F-FDG-PET/CT whole body scan , where after they
      go to lymphoscintigraphy incl. SPECT/CT and sentinel node biopsy. Material from the oral
      cancer and, after permission of each patient, also normal oral tissue will be analyzed
      molecular-biologically. Also a blood sample will be analyzed for molecular tumor markers.

      The investigators want to see if PET/CT is able to detect any signs of sub-clinically
      metastases. Besides, the investigators want to fusion PET/CT with SPECT/CT data from the
      lymphoscintigraphy study and improve our PET/CT scanning with a dual-time PET scan of the
      head-and-neck region.

    <textblock>
      These patients are normally preoperatively sent to a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen; in
      this study, this CT is replaced by a wholebody PET/CT scan. Afterwards, the patients goes to
      sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy and then to operation.

      By combining biomarkers and molecular imaging in patients with a clinically T1/T2N0M0 oral
      cancer, we want to characterize the tumor physiologically and correlate these physiological
      features to the clinical appearance of the cancer.

      Aims of the study:

        -  can PET/CT in this patient group metastases with consequently change of treatment?

        -  can fusion of SPECT/CT and PET/CT with calculation of standardized uptake value (SUV)
           indicate, how much tumor tissue there should be in a positive sentinel node to be
           detected by PET?

        -  can dual-time PET scanning better determine lymph node metastases, than single-time PET
           scanning?

        -  correlation between SUV in PET with molecular-biological findings both in the primary
           tumor and in metastases
