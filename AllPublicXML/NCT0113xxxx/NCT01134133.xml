  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital inpatients who have gurgling sounds heard during speech or breathing have been
      observed to have a higher risk of hospital acquired pneumonia. Patients who gurgle and who
      consent to participation will be randomized to receive routine clinical management or
      management to include measures employed to reduce risks of aspiration, namely, 1. head of bed
      up (30 degrees or higher), 2. swallowing evaluation by speech therapist (and feeding
      predicated on formal evaluation), 3. prompting managing physicians to reduce sedating
      medications to minimal effective dose.
