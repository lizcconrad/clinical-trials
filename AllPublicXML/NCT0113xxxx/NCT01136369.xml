      The study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive
      predictive value of the OSNA Breast Cancer System by comparing its performance to permanent
      section Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC staining.

    <description>For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The OSNA Breast Cancer System is an automated semi-quantitative, in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid detection of greater than (&gt;) 0.2 mm metastases in nodal tissue removed from sentinel lymph node biopsies of breast cancer patients. Results from the assay can be used to guide the intra-operative or post-operative decision to remove additional lymph nodes and to aid in patient staging. An assay positive + or ++ result indicates the presence of metastasis (&gt; 0.2 mm). An assay positive ++ result predicts the presence of macrometastasis (&gt; 2 mm).
Post-operative histological evaluation of permanent sections of the tissue specimen, in accordance with usual diagnostic practice and using the Sysmex lymph node cutting scheme, is required.</description>
