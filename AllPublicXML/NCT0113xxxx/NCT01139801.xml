  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to specifically investigate the efficacy of an alternative
      pharmacologic cervical ripening agent, misoprostol, versus the standard oxytocin, as an
      adjunct to Foley balloon for induction of the unfavorable cervix.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study is a randomized, controlled study with two arms. Both groups will
      undergo placement of a Foley catheter, through the external and internal os of the cervix,
      according to standard practice. In group A, receiving intravenous infusion of oxytocin, will
      serve as the control group as it is standard protocol at Aultman Hospital. Group B,
      intravaginal placement of misoprostol, will serve as the experimental group. The expected
      duration of participation begins at induction of labor and concludes at time of delivery.
