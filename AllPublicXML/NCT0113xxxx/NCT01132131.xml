  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emergency Ward Center in Oslo has the last two years used a questionnaire to identify
      patients who qualify for treatment of acute cystitis by the use of a delegation form.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate this practice, the primary objective being to evaluate if
      in a selected patient group the treatment outcome after identifying patients with probable
      acute cystitis by delegation form will be as good or better than the treatment received after
      a regular doctor's consultation.

      The planned study will also investigate which symptoms, signs and laboratory findings that
      coincide with significant bacteruria.

      The reference standard will be a microbiological culture of every patients urine.

    <description>The study aims to compare the use of a delegation form to identify patient's who qualify for antibiotic treatment for suspected acute cystitis with a regular doctor's consultation. The key outcomes are lack of bacteruria and symptoms of UTI at followup times.</description>
