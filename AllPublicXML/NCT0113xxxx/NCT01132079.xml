  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate the role of pimecrolimus in restoring disturbed skin barrier
      function and reversing epidermal abnormalities found in atopic dermatitis (AD). The project
      is based on findings the investigators presented at the recent SID meeting in Providence and
      published in the J Invest Dermatol (122: 1423-31, 2004). The investigators research shows
      that AD is characterized by impaired skin barrier function, reduced stratum corneum
      hydration, impaired epidermal lipid composition and epidermal differentiation. In this
      proposed project, the investigators wish to examine the influence of pimecrolimus and
      betamethasone valerate on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a marker of the skin barrier
      function, on stratum corneum hydration, on stratum corneum lipid content and on epidermal
      differentiation regarding keratins and cornified envelope proteins in AD patients. The study
      involves biophysical measurements of TEWL and skin hydration, lipid analysis,
      immuno-histochemistry, Western blotting and micro array techniques. This study shall clarify
      whether pimecrolimus restores the epidermal barrier and whether this contributes to the
      beneficial effect of pimecrolimus on AD.

      Objectives:

      To explore the stratum corneum hydration, transepidermal water loss, capacity for barrier
      repair and the integrity of the stratum corneum in patients treated with 1 % pimecrolimus
      cream when applied twice a day to atopic dermatitis of the upper limbs, and to access the
      substance's influences on the epidermis through histological, ultra-structural, and
      biochemical analysis using punch biopsies from day 1 of one arm and day 22 from both treated
      arms. 0.1 % betamethasone valerate cream b.i.d will be used as a control treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may be included only if the following apply at the baseline visit (day 0, before
        first application of study medication).

        Patients to be included are:

          -  Males and females of any race.

          -  &gt;= 18 years old.

          -  Have atopic dermatitis as defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria.

          -  History of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis

          -  At least 10 % of each upper limb affected by atopic dermatitis excluding the surface
             area of the hands, as these will not be treated in order to avoid cross-contamination.
             As reference: one hand (palm and fingers) corresponds to 10% of patient's upper limb
             surface.

          -  One specific, representative area of the disease on each upper limb with similar size
             and severity on both upper limbs. These will be considered the target lesions.

          -  A target lesion score of at least 3 to 8 (on a scale of 0-12) for both right and left
             target lesions and not differing more than 1 score point between the right and left
             sides.

          -  be able to suspended treatment of atopic dermatitis with other therapies for the
             duration of the study (4-6 weeks).

          -  Must be informed of study procedures and have signed the informed consent form
             approved for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Females:

          -  Who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Who are menstruating, capable of becoming pregnant and not practicing a medically
             approved method of contraception. &quot;Medically approved&quot; contraceptive may, at the
             discretion of the investigator, include abstinence. (If patients are on oral
             contraceptives, they must have begun treatment at least one month prior to baseline
             and continue at least four weeks after the last treatment).

        Other therapies/medications:

          -  Prior phototherapy or systemic therapy known to or suspected to have an effect on
             atopic dermatitis within 14 days prior to first application of study medication.
             Patients on a low stable dose of inhaled steroids (dose known to have negligible
             systemic absorption) and systemic antihistamines may participate.

          -  Topical therapy known to or suspected to have an effect on atopic dermatitis
             (including topical steroids, topical tacrolimus ointment or topical pimecrolimus
             cream) on the upper limbs within 7 days prior to first application of study
             medication.

          -  Topical therapy known to or suspected to have an effect on atopic dermatitis on other
             areas than upper limbs if total body surface treated is higher than 20% (due to the
             higher risk of systemic absorption affecting the lesions of the upper limbs) within 7
             days prior to first application of study medication

        Concurrent diseases / conditions and history of their diseases / conditions:

          -  Patients who have signs of skin atrophy and corticoid damage on the target areas

          -  Patients who are immunocompromised (e.g. lymphoma, AIDS, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome)

          -  Patients who have concurrent skin disease (e.g. impetigo) on or near the study area
             which could interfere with study evaluations

          -  Patients who have acute viral skin infections (e.g. herpes simplex, varicella zoster)
             Investigational drug / therapy use.

          -  Patients who have used investigational drugs within 8 weeks prior to first application
             of study medication or intend to use other investigational drugs during the course of
             the study Ingredient hypersensitivity

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study medication (see
             technical information sheet) Compliance / reliability / investigator judgment

          -  Patients who who are, in the opinion of the investigator, known to be unreliable or
             non-compliant with medical treatment, or are known to miss appointments (according to
             patient records)

          -  Patients who drug abuse problems, mental dysfunction or other factors limiting their
             ability to cooperate fully

          -  Patients who any other condition or prior/present treatment which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, will render the patient ineligible for the study
