  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection with mediastinal lymph node sampling is currently the therapy of choice
      for early stage (I-II) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selected patients unwilling or
      unable to tolerate surgery are referred for so-called 'curative' high dose radiotherapy. This
      has shown to result in a long term local disease control rate and a high cancer specific
      survival.

      The current trial addresses the relationship between blood and tissue biomarkers, bio-imaging
      and pathology in patients with early stage NSCLC treated with hypofractionated radiation
      therapy and surgery.
