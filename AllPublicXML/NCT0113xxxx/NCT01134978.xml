  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to gain insight into the neural mechanisms of learning
      multiple tasks. By examination of cognitive and behavioral output during the performance and
      learning of several computer maze tasks, and through a detailed examination of the neural
      activity obtained from functional near-infrared (fNIR) and electroencephalography (EEG), it
      may be possible to gain insight into the impact of the amount of practice and the
      organization of practice has on learning fine motor skills. This insight may provide
      direction as to how to better develop instructional and rehabilitation protocols in addition
      to clinical interventions to facilitate recovery of function, relearning and transfer of
      cognitive and fine motor skills based upon neural responses to physical practice.

    <description>Subjects are randomly assigned to either a blocked or random practice schedule when learning three 3-D computer mazes. A blocked practice schedule is created when the tasks to be learned are presented in a predictable order, while a random practice schedule has tasks presented in a nonsequential, unpredictable order. Neural activity and behavioral measures will differ for the two practice schedules. For memory and transfer, it is predicted that random practice will be better than blocked practice.</description>
