      The purpose of this study is to assess the response rate at 6 months in Myelodysplastic
      Syndrome (MDS) patients, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML-2) patients, and Acute
      Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) patients with up to 30% bone marrow blasts, treated with low-dose
      decitabine who have previously failed therapy with 5-azacitidine.
