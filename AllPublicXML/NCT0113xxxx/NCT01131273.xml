      This study will obtain pilot data on the acceptability of a 12-week course of daily observed
      suboxone and methadone, followed by a dose taper or referral to a local treatment program for
      80 opioid dependent patients (40 group) who have been injecting subutex or other
      buprenorphine preparations 10 or more days in the past 30, and on the impact of each
      medication on HIV risk and on subutex and opioid use during treatment and a followup at week
      20. it will be done at the Uranti Methadone Program, affiliated with the Addiction Research
      Center, Union Alternative of Georgia in Tbilisi.
