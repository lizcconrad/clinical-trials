      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose dexamethasone versus
      high dose dexamethasone in the treatment of radiation induced vomiting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is an effective medication to ameliorate radiation induced headache and
      vomiting. In our Toronto experience dexamethasone in low doses (1 mg/m2/day) is sufficient in
      treating these symptoms. However this experience is not shared from many neuro-oncology
      centers of excellence that more commonly use 5 mg/m2/day according to the results of the
      trans-Canadian survey. A prospective multicenter trial evaluating the effectiveness of
      dexamethasone in different dose regimens in symptomatic children while undergoing CNS
      radiation will elucidate the appropriate dose.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the evaluation of effectiveness of dexamethasone on vomiting after 24-48 hours (after 2-4 doses of treatment). Vomiting is defined as either retching or vomiting and will be counted in events. The frequency of emetic episodes/day will be documented in the daily diary. The effectiveness of dexamethasone will be counted in number of episodes and evaluated on day 2 (48 hours after first dose).</description>

    <description>Subjects scheduled to undergo radiation therapy are enrolled before the therapy is started. Once radiation therapy begins they will complete a daily diary about any headaches or nausea/vomiting they experience.
If they experience increased headache or vomiting they will be randomized to receive either a high or a low dose of dexamethasone, to control these symptoms.</description>

    <description>Subject will receive 5 mg/m2 po divided in two doses. Dexamethasone 4mg/mL solution will be compounded into a 1mg/mL dosage form.
If symptoms are well controlled over 2 weeks time, tapering of dexamethasone can be considered. It will be at the treating physician's discretion to decide the start of the tapering of dexamethasone. The weaning schedule will be the same in both intervention arms: halving the dose once weekly (week 1, week 2) while continuing to give two doses/day, one half morning dose at week 3 and every second day at week 4.</description>
