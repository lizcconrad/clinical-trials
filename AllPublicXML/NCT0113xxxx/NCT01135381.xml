  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For complex medical patients, the transition from hospital to home-based care is a vulnerable
      period, placing the patient at high risk for adverse events. Using a Care Transition
      conceptual model, the investigators propose developing and evaluating, through a randomized
      controlled trial, &quot;e-Coach,&quot; an Interactive-Voice-Response-supported (IVR) Care Transition
      coaching intervention, focused initially on patients hospitalized with heart failure or
      obstructive lung disease. This trial will test the primary hypothesis that the proportion of
      patients with one or more re-hospitalizations during a 90-day post-discharge follow-up period
      will be less in an IVRsupported care transition intervention (e-Coach) compared to a &quot;usual
      care&quot; comparison group.

    <textblock>
      For complex medical patients, the transition from hospital to home-based care is a vulnerable
      period, placing the patient at high risk for adverse events, including the experience of a
      medical error or loss of community tenure. Recent successful studies have used a Care
      Transition Intervention (CTI), using a nurse who conducts home visits, telephone follow-up,
      and provides assistance at and after discharge. Although successful, this model is costly and
      and not feasible in settings serving geographically dispersed populations. We propose a
      cost-efficient technological solution to the problems presented by the traditional CTI
      through &quot;e-Coach,&quot; an Interactive-Voice-Response-supported (IVR) Care Transition coaching
      intervention. We propose to develop and evaluate &quot;e-Coach,&quot; by performing a randomized
      controlled trial of this intervention versus a usual care comparison group. Our Specific Aims
      are to: 1) Randomize 720 patients at high risk of transition-related errors (complex adult
      patients discharged alive after a hospitalization with congestive heart failure (CHF) or
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), from a geographically diverse area including
      many rural areas across Alabama and the South) to an IVR-supported care transition program
      (&quot;e-Coach&quot;) versus a usual care comparison group. The IVR system will actively call patients
      at multiple intervals after discharge. In a stepped-care approach, the IVR will be further
      supported by a Care Transition nurse who monitors patient symptoms through the e-Coach IVR
      and supports patient self management through telephone-based interactions when needed, up to
      3 months after discharge; 2) Evaluate use of the e-Coach by patients and healthcare
      providers; 3) Evaluate the impact of the e-Coach on patient outcomes, including 90 day
      rehospitalizations, successful community tenure over a 3 month period, medication
      discrepancies, and patient self-efficacy based on the previously validated Care Transition
      Measure; and 4) Quantify the cost associated with the e-Coach.
