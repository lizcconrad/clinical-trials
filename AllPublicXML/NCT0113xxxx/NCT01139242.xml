  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening and physical activity
      in members of African-American churches who are 50 years old and older. The control arm
      receives the Body &amp; Soul program, a program to increase fruit and vegetable intake. The
      investigators hypothesize that those receiving the intervention, which includes four tailored
      newsletters and peer counseling, will be more likely to be screened if not up-to-date, and
      more likely to increase physical activity if screening was up-to-date at baseline, than
      controls.
