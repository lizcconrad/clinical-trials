  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the acknowledgment that physical activity is important for health, there are still
      few population-based or school-based studies that uses the current physical activity
      guidelines for adolescents.

      Physical inactivity was defined a less than 300 min/w of moderate to vigorous-intensity
      physical activity practice.

      Previous research has shown very high prevalence rates of physically inactive adolescents and
      a strong association with demographic, socioeconomic and biological factors.

      Based on this information, the investigators are elaborating a systematic review of
      literature to obtain and provide more accurate information in this context.

      The objectives of this study were to (i) review extant literature on the prevalence of
      physical inactivity (PI) in adolescents of both sex (10-18 years old); (ii) compare its
      prevalence between developed and developing countries.

      The search was carried out using online databases (Biomed Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC,
      MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Scopus, SPORTDiscus), references cited by retrieved articles and by
      contact with the authors, considering articles published from the establishment of the
      databanks until April 29th, 2010.
