      RATIONAL FOR STUDYING IV NAC AS POTENTIAL CHEMOPROTECTANT:

      Cisplatin has shown efficacy in the treatment of subjects with epithelial ovarian cancer.
      Systemic toxicities associated with cisplatin include nephro, oto, and nerve toxicities. It
      may be possible to reduce the toxicities of cisplatin by administering it in conjunction with
      IV NAC. NAC may reduce cisplatin related nephro, oto, and nerve toxicities without
      compromising the effectiveness of the chemotherapy against the ovarian cancer cells. It is
      possible that this combination of drugs may in the future allow ovarian cancer patients to
      receive the full series of IP cisplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy, with fewer side effects and
      improved survival.

      It is hypothesized that the proposed treatment of stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer
      with IP cisplatin and IV/IP paclitaxel in conjunction with IV NAC will limit the
      neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity that is associated with cisplatin
      administration.

      OBJECTIVES:

      PRIMARY:

      To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and assess the toxicity of IV NAC in
      conjunction with IP cisplatin and IV/IP paclitaxel in subjects with stage 3 or 4 epithelial
      ovarian cancer that has been surgically debulked

      SECONDARY:

        -  To describe tumor response in subjects receiving treatment for previously debulked stage
           3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP cisplatin, IV/IP paclitaxel , and IV NAC.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity (Creatinine Clearance (CrCl))
           in subjects undergoing treatment for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP
           cisplatin, IV paclitaxel and IV NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of hearing loss in subjects undergoing treatment
           for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP cisplatin, IV/IP paclitaxel and IV
           NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

        -  To describe the incidence and severity of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy in
           subjects undergoing treatment for stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer with IP
           cisplatin, IV/IP Taxol and IV NAC and who have had their disease surgically debulked.

      OUTLINE:

      Subjects will undergo chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer with paclitaxel IV, 135
      mg/m2 (Day 1) and IP cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (Day2), followed by Taxol IP, 60 mg/m2 (Day 8) every
      3 weeks for 6 courses. Sixty minutes prior to each course of IP cisplatin, IV NAC (starting
      at 150 mg/kg) will be infused over 30 minutes. A dose escalation schema for NAC will be
      followed. Toxicity to the therapy will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events.

    <description>The MTD of IV NAC will be defined as one dose level below that which produces NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity in 20% of subjects. The toxicity of NAC can be differentiated from that of the chemotherapeutic drugs as the half-life of NAC is very short and adverse effects are seen either during or very soon after the administration of NAC.</description>
