    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the disease free survival rate of a combination of capecitabine
      [Xeloda] and oxaliplatin (XELOX) with trastuzumab [Herceptin] in patients with resectable
      gastric cancer. The combination of Xeloda (orally, 1000 mg/m2 on day 1-14 of every cycle) and
      Herceptin (intravenously, 8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg on days 1-14 of every cycle)
      will be administered for three cycles prior to surgery to resect the tumor. If complete
      resection, R0 or microscopic residual tumor R1 is achieved, patients will continue with three
      cycles of XELOX and Herceptin and then for completion of 12 months treatment with Herceptin
      alone. Oxaliplatin will be administered intravenously at a dose of 130 mg/m2 on day 1 in
      every cycle. The anticipated time on study drug will be 12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival (DFS) at Month 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>DFS was the time elapsed from the time of surgery (for complete resection [R0] participants) until the date on which progression or death from any cause was documented (whichever occured first). Progression was defined as target lesions greater than (&gt;) 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 millimeter (mm) increase over the nadir. When the sum becomes very small, increases within the measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to a 20% increase. Participants who did not present progression and who had not died were censored on the last date on which it was known that there was no progression (last response assessment).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Days 7 and 21 of the 3rd cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, thereafter, every 9 weeks during adjuvant treatment and then after adjuvant treatment every 3 months until Month 25</time_frame>
    <description>pCR was defined as an absence of any invasive cancer cell of the primary tumor after the time of major neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Tumor Resection (R0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Days 7 and 21 of the 3rd cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, thereafter, every 9 weeks during adjuvant treatment and then after adjuvant treatment every 3 months until Month 25</time_frame>
    <description>R0 resection was defined as having performed a complete resection of the tumor with adequate tumor-free margins and regional lymph node extirpation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Days 7 and 21 of the 3rd cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, thereafter, every 9 weeks during adjuvant treatment and then after adjuvant treatment every 3 months until Month 25</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response was defined as either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, and no new lesions. PR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of greater than or equal to (≥) 1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival (DFS) at Month 18</title>
        <description>DFS was the time elapsed from the time of surgery (for complete resection [R0] participants) until the date on which progression or death from any cause was documented (whichever occured first). Progression was defined as target lesions greater than (&gt;) 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 millimeter (mm) increase over the nadir. When the sum becomes very small, increases within the measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to a 20% increase. Participants who did not present progression and who had not died were censored on the last date on which it was known that there was no progression (last response assessment).</description>
