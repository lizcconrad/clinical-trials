  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of AMG
      780 in up to 62 subjects with advanced solid tumors. The dose escalation part of the study is
      aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG
      780. The dose expansion will consist of up to 20 subjects and the dose level of AMG 780 will
      be dependent upon emerging safety and PK data from the dose escalation part of the study.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Part A, the dose escalation and primary objective of the study, was completed. Part B, the dose
    expansion, was not conducted due to a business decision.
