  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab, erlotinib, and panitumumab are all recently FDA approved epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that treat a wide variety of tumor types, such as colon, lung, and
      head and neck. Blockade of the EGFR results in inhibition of multiple downstream pathways,
      leading to slowed tumor growth. In addition, these inhibitors may enhance anti-tumor immune
      responses through uncharacterized mechanisms. While producing significant responses in many
      settings, EGFR inhibitors also result in significant skin toxicity (rash) in a high
      percentage of patients. Multiple studies have correlated the presence and severity of rash
      with clinical response. Unfortunately, severe rash can often lead to dose delays, reductions,
      or even discontinuation of EGFR inhibitors, thus limiting their efficacy. The mechanism of
      both the rash and its correlation with tumor response is poorly understood. Skin biopsies
      display a robust leukocyte infiltrate, but a systematic analysis of the type of infiltrating
      leukocytes, activation state, or homing receptor expression has not been performed.
      Chemokines and chemokine receptors control leukocyte trafficking to the skin and other tissue
      sites, and defined receptor profiles for skin-, gut-, and lung-homing leukocytes are well
      established. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the homing phenotype of
      leukocytes from peripheral blood and skin biopsies of patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. The
      investigators will use RNA microarrays to evaluate the expression of chemokines and other key
      genes regulated in skin during treatment. The investigators will utilize in vitro methods to
      investigate effects of EGFR inhibitors on imprinting of T cell tissue-specific homing
      receptors. The investigators will examine correlations among the pathologic data, clinical
      findings, and tumor response. If validated, peripheral blood evaluation could potentially be
      used as a predictive indicator for patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. This study may also
      identify novel targets for limiting skin toxicity while receiving EGFR inhibitors, thus
      allowing maximal dosing and clinical response from these agents.
