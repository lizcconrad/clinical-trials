      The investigators try to objectively and scientifically explore various brain function
      impairments in ADHD children by electrophysiologic tests, with and without medication.

      The aims of this study are to explore the various cognitive impairments of ADHD children, to
      differentiate various subtypes of ADHD children, and to investigate the efficacy of anti-ADHD
      drugs on various cognitive performance of ADHD children by event-related potentials(ERP).

      Children, aged six to 18 years old, are enrolled and assigned to three groups (normal
      control, pure ADHD, and ADHD with comorbidities). ADHD children fulfill the DSM-IV-TR
      criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. ADHD children are evaluated by Chinese version of SNAP-IV
      Rating Scale for rating ADHD-related symptoms before and after medication. EEG and
      audiometric testing are required for every participant to exclude dialeptic seizures and
      hearing impairment respectively.

      Methylphenidate (either immediate-release or extended-release formulations) or atomoxetine
      Hydrochloride is given to ADHD participants.Continuous performance task (CPT) and ERP tasks
      are applied.

        One hundred and fifty children, aged 6-18 years old, are enrolled. ADHD children fulfill
        the DSM-IV-TR criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. ADHD children are evaluated by Chinese
        version of SNAP-IV Rating Scale for rating ADHD-related symptoms before and after
        medication. EEG and audiometric testing are required for every participant to exclude
        dialeptic seizures and hearing impairment respectively. Urine pregnancy test is performed
        to exclude pregnant participants. Each participant is evaluated by both pediatric
        neurologists and child psychiatrists after enrollment to delineate possible underlying
        comorbidities. Three groups of participants were assigned: normal control group, pure ADHD
        group and ADHD with comorbidity group.
