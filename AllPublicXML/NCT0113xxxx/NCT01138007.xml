      This is a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-comparison
      study to confirm the efficacy of 323U66 Sustained Release (SR) orally administered to
      patients with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) at doses level of 150 mg/day and 300 mg/day for
      8 weeks based on the decrease in MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) total
      score, and to evaluate the safety based on adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and
      vital signs.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8/Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8/Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS scale measures the depression level of a participant. The total score was derived by adding the scores of the following 10 items: 1, Apparent sadness; 2, Reported sadness; 3, Inner tension; 4, Reduced sleep; 5, Reduced appetite; 6, Concentration difficulties; 7, Lassitude; 8, Inability to feel; 9, Pessimistic thoughts; 10, Suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score is 60; 0, no depression; 60, severely depressed. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the value at Week 8/Withdrawal minus the value at Baseline. The least squared means were estimated based on the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including Baseline MADRS score and region as covariates.</description>

    <description>The IDS-SR is a 30-item scale used to evaluate the severity and changes in depressive symptoms. Each item was scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (greatest symptom severity). Only five items (item 19: general interest; item 20: energy level; item 21: capacity for pleasure or enjoyment, excluding sex; item 22: interest in sex; item 30: leaden paralysis/physical energy) were evaluated for this endpoint, as a subset of the total score. The lowest possible total score and subset total score of IDS-SR are 0 and 0, and the highest possible total score and subset total score of IDS-SR are 84 and 15, respectively. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 minus the value at Baseline. The least squared means were estimated based on the ANCOVA model including Baseline IDS-SR subscore and region as covariates.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 572 participants were enrolled in the study; however, 3 of these participants were mistakenly registered and were not randomized to study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who met the inclusion criteria enrolled in the 1- to 2-week Run-in Phase before entering the 8-week Treatment Phase, followed by the 2-week Follow-up Phase. In the Run-in Phase, the previous/existing prohibited medications administered were washed out, and participants' clinical symptoms were carefully monitored.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8/Withdrawal</title>
        <description>The MADRS scale measures the depression level of a participant. The total score was derived by adding the scores of the following 10 items: 1, Apparent sadness; 2, Reported sadness; 3, Inner tension; 4, Reduced sleep; 5, Reduced appetite; 6, Concentration difficulties; 7, Lassitude; 8, Inability to feel; 9, Pessimistic thoughts; 10, Suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score is 60; 0, no depression; 60, severely depressed. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the value at Week 8/Withdrawal minus the value at Baseline. The least squared means were estimated based on the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including Baseline MADRS score and region as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the MADRS Total Score at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6</title>
        <description>The MADRS scale measures the depression level of a participant. The total score was derived by adding the scores of the following 10 items: 1, Apparent sadness; 2, Reported sadness; 3, Inner tension; 4, Reduced sleep; 5, Reduced appetite; 6, Concentration difficulties; 7, Lassitude; 8, Inability to feel; 9, Pessimistic thoughts; 10, Suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score is 60; 0, no depression; 60, severely depressed. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the value at Week 1, 2, 4 and 6 minus the value at Baseline. The least squared means were estimated based on the ANCOVA model including Baseline MADRS score and region as covariates.</description>

The total score was derived by adding the scores of the following 10 items: 1, Apparent sadness; 2, Reported sadness; 3, Inner tension; 4, Reduced sleep; 5, Reduced appetite; 6, Concentration difficulties; 7, Lassitude; 8, Inability to feel; 9, Pessimistic thoughts; 10, Suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score is 60; 0, no depression; 60, severely depressed. A MADRS remitter is defined as a participant with a MADRS total score &lt;=11 at Week 8.</description>

        <description>The IDS-SR is a 30-item scale used to evaluate the severity and changes in depressive symptoms. Each item was scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (greatest symptom severity). The maximum total score is 84 (0: no symptoms; 84: greatest symptom severity), as participants were asked to answer either item 11 (decreased appetite) or item 12 (increased appetite) (not both) and either item 13 (decreased weight) or item 14 (increased weight) (not both). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 minus the value at Baseline.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the IDS-SR Subscores for Energy, Pleasure, and Interest at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8</title>
        <description>The IDS-SR is a 30-item scale used to evaluate the severity and changes in depressive symptoms. Each item was scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (greatest symptom severity). Only five items (item 19: general interest; item 20: energy level; item 21: capacity for pleasure or enjoyment, excluding sex; item 22: interest in sex; item 30: leaden paralysis/physical energy) were evaluated for this endpoint, as a subset of the total score. The lowest possible total score and subset total score of IDS-SR are 0 and 0, and the highest possible total score and subset total score of IDS-SR are 84 and 15, respectively. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 minus the value at Baseline. The least squared means were estimated based on the ANCOVA model including Baseline IDS-SR subscore and region as covariates.</description>
