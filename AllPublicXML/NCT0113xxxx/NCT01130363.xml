  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The class of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medications such as omeprazole has proven extremely
      effective in the treatment and prevention of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Although the FDA
      approval for PPI therapy is limited to 6-8 weeks, many individuals remain on these agents for
      years, and human studies have suggested that long-term use of a PPI can result in
      enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia, as well as being associated with the
      development of fundic-gland polyps of the stomach. These findings raise the concern of the
      possibility that long-term use of PPIs may predispose to the development of neuroendocrine
      tumors in patients. The investigators aim to examine clinical parameters, including history
      of PPI use and fasting gastrin levels, as well as histologic characteristics (particularly
      the presence of ECL-cell hyperplasia) of patients found to have fundic gland polyps during
      endoscopy. The investigators hypothesize that there is a correlation between fundic gland
      polyps of the stomach and the use of proton pump inhibiter medications.

    <description>We aim to examine clinical parameters, including history of PPI use and fasting gastrin levels, as well as histologic characteristics (particularly the presence of ECL-cell hyperplasia) of patients found to have fundic gland polyps during endoscopy. We believe there is a correlation between fundic gland polyps of the stomach and use of proton pump inhibiter medications.</description>

      Blood draw: A fasting serum gastrin (FSG) level will be obtained to evaluate for
      hypergastrinemia at a follow-up visit after EGD. Approximately 4 cc's of blood is required.
      As many patients have been on long term PPI therapy, the FSG level is one method of
      determining whether the patient is on super-therapeutic levels of PPI which may need to be
      adjusted.

      Biopsy specimens: Gastric fundic gland polyps found during endoscopy will have biopsies taken
      of the polyp, adjacent normal gastric body or fundus, and from the antrum.

      Histological evaluation of biopsy specimens: Biopsies will be stained with H&amp;E as well as
      neuroendocrine cell markers to assess for the presence of ECL cell hyperplasia.
      Paraffin-fixed tissue will be stored for future biological analysis. This will only be done
      after all clinically relevant analyses are completed and only if adequate tissue remains.
