    <textblock>
      Acne rosacea is a chronic acneiform disorder affecting both the skin and the eye. It is a
      syndrome of undetermined etiology characterized by both vascular and papulopustular
      components involving the face and occasionally the neck and upper trunk.

      This is a pilot phase II study to evaluate the tolerability and safety and to monitor the
      clinical efficacy of Topical Minocycline Foam FXFM244 in moderate to severe Rosacea patients.

      A Pilot, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel Group, Dose Range Finding
      Study. The study will involve three treatment groups. Eligible patients will be randomized to
      receive either FXFM244 - 1%, FXFM244 - 4% or Placebo, in a blinded fashion. Patients will be
      treated twice daily for 12 weeks. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study
      subjects will return at Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12. A follow up visit will take place at week 16.
      At each visit, patients will be evaluated via lesion count, global assessment tolerability
      and safety.
