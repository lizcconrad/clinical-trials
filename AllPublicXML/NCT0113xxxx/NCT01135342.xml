      The goal is to determine if improved sleep will increase/enhance weight loss among overweight
      adults with insomnia.

      The major purpose of this study is to examine the effect of sleep quality and quantity on
      weight loss. The outcomes being studied are weight loss and improved sleep. The subjects
      being studied are those with body mass index 28-40kg/m2 who report sleeping less than 6.5
      hours per day for 4 day per week or more for the past 6 months or longer and would likely
      benefit the most from the sleep intervention should it prove to be effective. We hope to
      learn if improved sleep habits among overweight adults with insomnia will help them to adhere
      to a diet and exercise program and increase their success with weight loss. Given the current
      world-wide obesity epidemic and the established difficulties many people have with weight
      control, any approaches that can be demonstrated to contribute to successful weight loss have
      direct public health significance.
