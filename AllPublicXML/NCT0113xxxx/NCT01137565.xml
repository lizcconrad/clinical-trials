    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female subjects ≥12 to &lt; 18 years of age (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 as
             indicated in the study design).

          -  Male and/or non-reproductive female subjects between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive
             (for cohort 4).

          -  Females of non-reproductive potential must have documented medical history (ie,
             postmenopausal by history - no menses for 1 year - and follicle-stimulating hormone
             value (FSH) consistent with postmenopausal status per laboratory ranges; OR history of
             hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral
             oophorectomy).

          -  Females of child-bearing potential and females who cannot document non-reproductive
             potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control for the duration
             of the study and for 2 weeks after study drug administration. Males whose partners are
             of child bearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control
             for the duration of the study and continuing for 12 weeks after study drug
             administration. Highly effective methods of birth control (i.e., those with a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year) include sexual abstinence (males, females), vasectomy
             or a condom supplemented with the use of a spermicide (males) and occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps), hormonal birth control, or intrauterine device
             (IUD) used by the female partner.

          -  Male subjects whose partners become pregnant during the study must practice sexual
             abstinence or use a condom with spermicide for two weeks following study drug
             administration to ensure the unborn child is not potentially exposed to AMG 853 via
             semen. The pregnant partner information will be reported to Amgen per the Pregnancy
             Notification Worksheet.

          -  Intermittent or mild to moderate persistent asthma for the past 3 months (as defined
             by the 2004 Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] guidelines).

          -  On a stable pharmacologic regimen for the treatment of asthma for at least 3 months
             prior to study enrollment and does not anticipate any change to the regimen during the
             course of the study.

          -  Forced Expiry Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at screening visit ≥ 70% of predicted normal
             value (without aid of bronchodilator).

          -  FEV1 reversibility greater than or equal to 12% from baseline within 30 minutes of
             inhaled (up to 400 μg) or nebulized (up to 5 mg) albuterol at the office screening
             visit. Subjects unable to demonstrate reversibility during screening, must provide the
             most recent evidence of documented reversibility to the Amgen Medical Monitor and the
             principal investigator for review.

          -  Clinically acceptable physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical
             laboratory test values for the population tested. Any abnormal clinical laboratory
             results and/or ECG values must be discussed with the Sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, would pose a risk to subject
             safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion.

          -  Experienced an asthma exacerbation (defined as a disease episode resulting in
             treatment in an emergency room or urgent care facility, or an episode treated with
             oral corticosteroids) during the 3 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Hospitalized for asthma during the 6 months prior to study enrollment; or ever
             intubated for the treatment of asthma.

             or untreated exposure to a patient with active tuberculosis.

          -  History of autoimmune disorder (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus).

          -  Creatinine clearance within the screening period of less than 80 mL/min as calculated
             by the Cockcroft-Gault method.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic or respiratory
             disease other than asthma.

          -  History suggestive of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal ulceration or bowel disease
             (including but not limited to peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome), or a history of
             gastrointestinal surgery (excluding uncomplicated appendectomy).

          -  Any positive test for cotinine (tobacco use) on the day before dosing. A positive
             cotinine level is defined as any level exceeding the upper limit of normal as per
             local laboratory reference ranges.

          -  Known substance abuse (eg, alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) within 1 year of dosing as
