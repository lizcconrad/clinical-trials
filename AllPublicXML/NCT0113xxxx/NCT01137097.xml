      Objective: To investigate the incidence of lateral neck node occult metastasis and to show
      the usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the detection of lateral neck node
      metastasis in thyroid carcinoma, the investigators used a radioisotope to detect the sentinel
      lymph node.

      Summary Background Data: Although occult lymph node metastasis to the lateral neck
      compartment is common in papillary thyroid carcinoma, the incidence and patterns of lateral
      neck node metastasis in papillary carcinoma are not known.

      On the day of the operation, patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy after the
      intratumoral injection of a Tc-99m phytate 1 mCi in 0.1-0.2 mL 0.9% NaCl under
      ultrasonographic guidance. Total thyroidectomy or lobectomy with central neck dissection
      preceded SLN detection to avoid interference by primary tumor radioactivity. After total
      thyroidectomy or lobectomy, the dissections were performed toward the internal jugular chain
      beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A handheld, collimated gamma probe and
      lymphoscintigraphy were used to scan the lateral compartments (through skin and under the
      SCM) for &quot;radioactive&quot; lymph nodes. Removed SLNs were submitted immediately for frozen
      biopsy. If any of the SLNs were positive for metastasis on the frozen sections, MRND was
      performed immediately. In cases for which the frozen section was negative but the final
      pathology report detailed microscopic positivity in the lateral sentinel nodes, RAI ablations
      were performed without additional MRND.
