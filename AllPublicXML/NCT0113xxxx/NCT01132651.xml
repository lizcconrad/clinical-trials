    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality as Measured by a Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Survey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a clinical survey used to measure sleep quality. Seven components related to sleep quality are scored: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. Each component is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score of 0 is associated with better sleep quality and a score of 3 is associated with worse sleep quality. The seven component scores are summed to achieve a total PSQI score. The total PSQI score has a range of 0-21. A score of 0 is associated with better sleep quality and a score of 21 is associated with worse sleep quality.

    <measure>Change in Severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as Measured by a Change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA score is an assessment of AD severity. It is an assessment of the patient's disease state at the time of examination and does not attempt a comparison with any of the patient's previous disease states. Possible scores range from 0 to 5. A score of 0 is associated with no evidence of AD and a score of 5 is associated with severe AD.</description>

        <title>Change in Severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as Measured by a Change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score</title>
        <description>The IGA score is an assessment of AD severity. It is an assessment of the patient's disease state at the time of examination and does not attempt a comparison with any of the patient's previous disease states. Possible scores range from 0 to 5. A score of 0 is associated with no evidence of AD and a score of 5 is associated with severe AD.</description>
