      Observational: studies in human beings in which biomedical and/or health outcomes are
      assessed in pre-defined groups of individuals. Subjects in the study may receive diagnostic,
      therapeutic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign specific
      interventions to the subjects of the study.

      Study Phase Definition: Phase of investigation, as defined by the US FDA for trials involving
      investigational new drugs. Select only one.

      N/A: for trials without phases Observational Study Design Case-control: group of individuals
      with specific characteristics (e.g., conditions or exposures) compared to group(s) with
      different Time Perspective Cross-sectional: observations or measurements made at a single
      point in time, usually at subject enrollment Biospecimen Retention - select one Samples
      Without DNA - samples retained, with no potential for DNA extraction from any retained
      samples (e.g., fixed tissue, plasma) Biospecimen Description

      Sputum, whole blood, urine, tissue Enrollment

      Single group study Number of Groups/Cohorts Definition: Number of study groups/cohorts. Enter
      1 for a single-group study. Many observational studies have one group/cohort; case control
      studies typically have two.

      One study group, anticipated samples in the rang of 400-500 samples 8. Arms, Groups and
