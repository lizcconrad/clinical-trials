    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of SIRT as compared with
      Sorafenib in patients with locally advanced liver cancer in terms of overall survival (OS).

      The Study null hypothesis is, there is no difference in overall survival between patients
      receiving SIRT and those receiving Sorafenib therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common cancer worldwide but unfortunately
      between 70 - 80% of all HCC are in the Asia-Pacific because of the prevalence of chronic
      viral hepatitis in the region. The increase in the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in the
      Western world however predicts that HCC will similarly be an important cause of death there
      in the next 20 years.

      Only 15-20% of HCC are today potentially curable by surgery at the time of diagnosis. Another
      10-15% of patients may benefit from potentially curative locally ablative therapy such as
      radio-frequency ablation. Prognosis in the majority of patients has been dismal as
      conventional systemic therapies have been largely inefficacious. The first successfully
      trialed systemic targeted therapy, sorafenib (2007) prolonged survival by a modest average of
      3 months in patients with good underlying liver function.

      While the liver is radio-sensitive, external beam radiation causes significant
      radio-toxicity. To overcome this, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) was developed
      to deliver a radiation source directly to liver cancer via the arterial route. Sir-sphere is
      radioactive yttrium on a 90 micro-meter diameter resin carrier and is an established therapy
      in colorectal metastasis. Sir-sphere has been reported to cause significantly tumour
      regression in HCC.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of SIRT using SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres
      compared to sorafenib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced primary HCC.

    <description>Progression-free survival overall is defined as the time interval between randomisation and the date of tumour progression at any site in the body or death, whichever is earlier. Tumour progression at any site in the body will be measured by any definitive imaging technique including CT scan, MRI study or other nuclear medicine scan.

    <description>Sorafenib tosylate:
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation.
Sorafenib was shown to inhibit multiple intracellular (c-CRAF, BRAF and mutant BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, FLT- 3, RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR- 2, VEGFR- 3, and PDGFR- ÃŸ). Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth of the human hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, and several other human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice. A reduction in tumor angiogenesis and increases in tumor apoptosis was seen in models of human hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally a reduction in tumor cell signaling was seen in a model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.</description>

    <description>SIR-Spheres:
SIR-Spheres consist of biocompatible resin microspheres containing yttrium-90, with a size between 20 and 60 microns in diameter. Yttrium-90 is a high-energy pure beta-emitting isotope with no primary gamma emission. The half life of yttrium-90 is 64.1 hours. In clinical use which requires the isotope to decay to infinity, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11 days leaving only background radiation with no therapeutic value.
SIR-Spheres is implanted into hepatic tumours by delivery via either the common hepatic artery or the right or left hepatic artery using a catheter or implanted port . Once SIR-Spheres is implanted into the liver, it is not metabolised or excreted and it stays permanently in the liver.</description>
