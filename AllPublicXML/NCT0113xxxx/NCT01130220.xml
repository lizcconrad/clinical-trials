    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore the factors involved in brain cancer health care
      literacy needs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mere subset of the reasons behind unmet health care literacy needs include the health care
      systems' increasing complexity, increased time constraints, profound treatment decision
      making requirements, decreased financial resources, fracturing social networks and
      diversifying educational and cultural needs.

      This project will use focus groups to explore the factors involved in brain cancer health
      care literacy from the perspectives of patients and those involved in their care. Hypothesis
      generated from this project will be directly applied toward future projects. The overarching
      goals are improved access and adequacy of health care literacy information through the
      eventual development of validated, useful, reliable health care literacy information tools
      for brain cancer patients and those involved in their care.
