      This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following
      identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2 will
      explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in
      subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will
      characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD)
      markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above
      the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further
      the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to
      explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between
      GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints. Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent
      of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for
      potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098
      at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.

      This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following
      identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2
      will explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in
      subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will
      characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD)
      markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above
      the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further
      the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to
      explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between
      GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints.

      Subjects with solid tumors will receive GSK2256098 orally without interruption on consecutive
      days. The planned starting dose in Part 1 will be a total daily dose of 160 mg administered
      as 80 mg twice daily (BID) during the repeat dose phase of the study. In the first cohort,
      administration of study drug will be initiated as a single dose (80 mg) on Day 1 that will be
      followed by collection of PK samples. Subjects may then begin repeat dosing (80 mg BID) on
      Day 2 following the collection of the 24-h PK sample. In subsequent cohorts, administration
      of study drug will be given as a single dose (half the total daily dose) on Day 1 followed by
      collection of PK samples. Subjects may begin repeat dosing on Day 2 following collection of
      the 24-h PK sample.

      During dose escalation (Part 1), a modified accelerated dose titration design will be
      followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation design until the MTD is established. After the MTD
      is established approximately 30 additional subjects with tumors reported to have FAK
      over-expression will be enrolled to further explore the safety, tolerability and clinical
      activity of GSK2256098 (Part 2). Additional cohorts below the MTD may be expanded to further
      explore and characterize the range of biologically effective doses (Part 3). Part 4 will
      further explore the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in
      subjects with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Part 5 will investigate the time
      course, the extent of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing,
      and screen for potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure
      of GSK2256098 at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.
