      This study compared the rate and extent of absorption of ranitidine 300 rng tablets versus
      Zantac. The study products were administered as a single oral dose of 1 x 300 mg tablet using
      a randomized, two-way crossover fasting study in non-smoker healthy volunteers with a washout
      period of 7 days.
