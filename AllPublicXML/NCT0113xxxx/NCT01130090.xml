  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients under bi-level pressure support ventilation for obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
      this study aims to determine if it is better, in terms of efficacy and patient-ventilator
      synchronisation to use

        -  Spontaneous mode (S)

        -  Spontaneous/Timed mode (ST) with an intermediate back-up rate, slightly below the
           respiratory rate of the patient

        -  Timed mode (T), with a ventilator respiratory rate above that of the patient. This issue
           has to our knowledge only been marginally studied without any consensus.

      Eligibility: patients under home bi-level pressure support ventilation for obesity
      hypoventilation in a stable clinical condition, aged over 18

      Methods:

      Three consecutive sleep studies in a randomised sequence with usual parameters Inspiratory
      Positive Airway Pressure(IPAP), Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) and change of only
      back up respiratory rate (RR): one night in a spontaneous mode, one with an intermediate RR,
      and one with a RR above that of the patient

      Endpoints:

      Quality of sleep and sleep structure (polysomnography), patient-ventilator synchronisation
      and respiratory events under NIV, efficacy of ventilation: oxygen saturation measured by
      pulse oxymetry (SaO2); transcutaneous capnography (PtcCO2), and comfort.

    <description>3 consecutive nights in randomized order, in either &quot;S&quot; (Spontaneous) mode, &quot;ST&quot; (Spontaneous/Timed) mode with a back-up rate under spontaneous respiratory rate of the patient, or in &quot;ST&quot; (Spontaneous/Timed) mode with a back-up rate at least 2 cycles/minute above spontaneous nocturnal respiratory rate. Each assessment will include complete polysomnographic recording (sleep study) as well as SpO2, PtcCO2, pneumotachograph (flow), mask pressure, quantitative assessment of patient-ventilator synchronisation, central or obstructive apnea and hypopnea, data of built-in software, and rating of patient comfort</description>
