      The purpose of this study is:

        -  Initial evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of Image Guided Transcutaneous
           Electrical Stimulation (TENS) device for treatment of non-specific low back pain.

        -  To assess the tolerability and acceptability of the device by the caregiver (&quot;User
           Friendly&quot;).

        -  To evaluate patients' tolerance by monitoring side effects and tolerability during
           treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical nerves stimulation (TENS) devices are a drug-free alternative for
      managing pain. For the past thirty years, doctors have been prescribing FDA approved TENS
      worldwide as an effective way to relieve pain. TENS device currently utilized includes a
      variety of types of devices and pulse modulations. Most of these devices are applied on large
      surface areas, and are designed to block the pain signal (gate mechanism) to the brain.
      Others manual TENS devices are applied to small surface areas to stimulate peripheral nerve
      ends, and by that causing the release of endorphins with a significantly superior clinical
      outcome. Such treatments are time consuming and cumbersome and requires previous knowledge of
      location of nerve ends.

      A novel device capable of scanning a large skin surface area, automatically locating nerve
      ends responsible for pain relief by utilizing skin impedance measurements and image
      processing with anatomical matching will be tested for stimulating these peripheral nerve
      ends (NeMa-st, Nervomatrix Ltd., Netanya, Israel).

      For this purpose an open study to initially evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention
      is designed. 20 patients will undergo 2 treatment sessions per week for a period of 4 weeks,
      while maintaining their pain relief medication treatment regime.
