  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xenografts and cell cultures provide sufficient material for analyses at the protein, RNA and
      DNA level. Patient derived NSCLC xenografts and cell lines are available but none however are
      Asian in origin. Given the emerging evidence to suggest inter-ethnic differences in NSCLC
      biology, new models of preclinical drug evaluation should be designed and validated using
      Asian tumors. Furthermore, such models will allow studies of biological mechanisms of
      sensitivity and/or resistance and also the study of dynamic regulations under standardized
      conditions in the Asian context.

        The investigators for this protocol are clinicians and scientists in the departments of
        Cardiac/Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Haematology and Oncology, Pathology, Radiation
        Oncology, Respiratory Medicine and the Cancer Sciences Institute of Singapore (CSIS) from
        NUH and NUS with major roles in their departments in the clinical management and/or
        research of lung cancer. Each will be providing access to clinical information and
        assisting in the collection and processing of samples, according to their resources and
        expertise.
