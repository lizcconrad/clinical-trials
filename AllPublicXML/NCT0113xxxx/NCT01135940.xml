  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase II (hypothesis generating) randomized pilot study investigating
      the efficacy of using Dermabond as a method of final wound closure as compared to the
      standard staple method in children with Neuromuscular Scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity
      correction surgery.

      1. To explore whether there is a difference in the incidence of wound infection in the
           Dermabond group vs. the skin staple group as measured by microbiological culture four
           days post-operatively. Wound infection is defined as prolonged sterile discharge (&gt;4
           days), positive wound cultures, or cellulitis four or more days post-operatively.

        2. To explore whether there is a difference in the cosmetic result of the wound closure as
           measured by the Hollander wound evaluation scale. Our hypothesis is that the Dermabond
           group will have a better cosmetic result. Secondary outcome

        3. To explore whether there is a difference in the time for final wound closure. Our
           hypothesis is that the Dermabond group will have a shorter time for final wound closure.
           Secondary outcome

        4. To explore whether there is a difference in mean caregiver/parental satisfaction scores
           as measured by a visual analog scale. Our hypothesis is that parental satisfaction will
           be higher in the Dermabond group. Secondary outcome
