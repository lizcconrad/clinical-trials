  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred consenting AIDS patients suffering from treatment induced painful neuropathy will
      be blindly randomize to Active and Placebo groups (ratio A/P = 3/2 and will receive
      increasing oral doses of dimiracetam starting from 400 mg b.i.d. and doubling the dose every
      two weeks until a maximum of 1600 mg b.i.d. Escalation to the the higher dose is allowed only
      if the previous dose did not cause tolerability problems. The highest reached dose will be
      maintained for a total of 8 week treatment. Patients must have a self evaluated pain of at
      least 4 on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). Primary end point of the study will be the
      number of Adverse Events (AEs) reported in the placebo versus the active group. Preliminary
      evidence of efficacy will be sought by comparing active and placebo group as to the intensity
      of their pain at study onset and at study end. The pain will be evaluated by the VAS the
      Total Symptoms Score and the Clinical Global Impression
