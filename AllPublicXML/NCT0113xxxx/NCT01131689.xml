  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preclinical studies, 5-fluorouracil, one of the active metabolites of S-1, showed
      synergistic effect to sorafenib in human colon carcinoma cell lines. Therefore, sorafenib
      combined with S-1 might be more effective treatment for patients with advanced HCC than
      sorafenib monotherapy. The investigators propose to conduct a phase I study to determine
      maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of S-1 in combination with fixed dose of sorafenib in patients
      with advanced HCC
