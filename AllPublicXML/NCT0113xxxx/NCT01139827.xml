    <textblock>
      Framingham risk score is well known screening tool that detect cardiovascular (CV) risk. But
      it is not suitable for CV risk in mild risk group. So 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a new imaging technique for detecting vascular inflammation
      within atherosclerotic plaques and hsCRP is also arising detection tool of CV risk.

      The investigators are examining this association in normal and impaired glucose tolerance
      patients groups.

      We examined vascular inflammation using FDG-PET scan in 178 subjects (Normal and impaired
      glucose tolerance groups). Vascular 18F-FDG uptake was measured as both the mean and maximum
      blood-normalized standardized uptake value (SUV), known as the target-to-background ratio
      (TBR). And We analyzed that the association with Framingham risk score, hs CRP and vascular
      inflammation by FDG-PET scan.
