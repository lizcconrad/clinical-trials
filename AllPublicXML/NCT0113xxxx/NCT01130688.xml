      The leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are cells that self- renew and give rise to leukemia.
      Eradication of LSC is required for cure. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) LSCs are not
      eradicated by imatinib (Gleevec) alone. Recent discovery by Dr. Shaoguang Li at University of
      Massachusetts indicates that the LSCs can be targeted by a new drug zileuton (Chen et al.
      Nature Genetics 2009; 41:783-792). Zileuton (approved for asthma) will be tested in a
      combination with Gleevec. This combination has not been used previously to treat leukemia.

      This is a Phase I study. The goal of this research is to evaluate the safety of the standard
      anti-cancer drug imatinib and experimental drug zileuton.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than twenty two thousand people live with chronic myelogenous leukemia in the United
      States and more than five thousand people are expected to be diagnosed this year. The
      majority of patients with this disease are diagnosed in what is called the chronic phase. The
      standard treatment for this phase of the disease is therapy with a medication called
      imatinib. This treatment can diminish the amount of disease to very low levels that only very
      sensitive and specialized techniques can measure; it does not, however, provide a cure.

      Dr. Shaoguang Li and colleagues at University of Massachusetts have published a unique
      discovery that the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) is a critical regulator
      for LSCs in BCR-ABL-induced CML (Chen Y et al. Loss of the Alox5 gene impairs leukemia stem
      cells and prevents chronic myeloid leukemia. Nature Genetics 41:783-792, 2009). In the
      absence of Alox5, BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in preclinical studies. While deficiency in
      Alox5 had no effect on normal hematopoiesis, impairment of the LSCs function through
      differentiation and cell division of CML LSCs was observed. This defect led to a depletion of
      LSCs and a failure of CML development. Treatment with a 5-LO inhibitor (zileuton) also
      impaired the function of LSCs and prolonged survival. These results demonstrate that a
      specific target gene can be found in cancer stem cells and its inhibition can completely
      inhibit the function of these stem cells. These findings provide an exciting opportunity to
      develop the first anti-cancer stem cell therapy for treating CML.
