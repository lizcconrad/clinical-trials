  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether children and adolescents 8-18 years of age
      with HLHS and related lesions who have undergone stage I palliation during infancy using an
      allograft patch demonstrate continued evidence of HLA antibody formation.

      This study will be of a prospective cross-sectional design, consisting of three groups. The
      first two groups (study groups) will consist of (1) subjects with HLHS and other related
      lesions who have undergone stage I palliation using an allograft patch during infancy and (2)
      subjects with &quot;single ventricle&quot; lesions who have undergone stage II palliation using
      allograft without antecedent stage I palliation. The third group (control group) will consist
      of subjects who have undergone corrective or palliative surgery for CHD during infancy in
      which an allograft patch was not used, and in which there have been no further exposures to
      allograft. We have chosen to study both (1) subjects who have undergone stage I and II
      palliation and (2)subjects who have undergone stage II palliation only in an attempt to
      distinguish between sensitization that may occur from allograft exposure during stage I
      palliation and that which may occur during stage II palliation.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine PRA in a cross-sectional analysis of children and adolescents who have undergone stage I palliation for HLHS and related lesions during infancy, and comparing PRA measurements in a similarly aged group of children and adolescents who have undergone congenital heart surgery during infancy without use of allograft.</description>

    <description>Study group I will include children who have undergone stage I palliation employing allograft material for left ventricular outflow tract reconstruction at CHOP during infancy (&lt;1 year of age). Stage I palliation is defined as an operation in which augmentation of the native ascending aorta and aortic arch is performed to bypass atresia or critical obstruction of the left heart structures.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Study Group II</arm_group_label>
    <description>Study group II who have undergone stage II palliation in which allograft material is used, but have not undergone antecedent stage I palliation. Stage II palliation is defined as a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in which the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery via either the bidirectional Glenn or hemi-Fontan procedures.</description>
