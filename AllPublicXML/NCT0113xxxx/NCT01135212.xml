      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of
      Fimasartan (60mg / 120mg) with Candesartan(8mg) in patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension.

      A randomized, double-blind, Candesartan controlled, parallel group comparison clinical study
      to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of Fimasartan in patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension Approximately 288 patients will be enrolled in 10 centers in South
      Korea. This study has planned 5 visits during 14 weeks (placebo run-in period 2 weeks,
      treatment period 12 weeks). All of the subjects who agreed to participate in this study and
      gave the written informed consent voluntary are assessed the exclusion and inclusion criteria
      and receive the investigational product(placebo) at screening visit.

      During more than 14 days of placebo run-in period, subjects have to stop the previous
      anti-hypertension drug. After 2 weeks, subjects are assessed the final eligibility and
      randomized into one of 3 groups(Fimasartan 60mg, Fimasartan 120mg, Candesartan 8mg) at
      baseline visit. Subjects take physical and laboratory tests and receive the investigational
      products per 4weeks during treatment period (12weeks).
