      This Phase Ib/II study is an open label, multicenter study.

      The study is divided in two parts:

      Phase I: an open-label, dose escalation study of F16IL2 in combination with paclitaxel for
      patients with solid tumours, bladder cancer, breast cancer, metastatic melanoma,
      mesothelioma, NSCLC, prostate cancer and sarcoma amenable to taxane therapy.

      Phase II: a prospective, single-arm, multicentre study of a fixed dose of F16IL2 in
      combination with paclitaxel, equivalent to stage 1 of the Simon two-stage phase II design,
      for patients with metastatic melanoma, breast cancer and NSCLC amenable to taxane therapy.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality, second only to lung cancer as a cause of
      cancer death in women. The five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has increased
      from 80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. However, the mortality rate in the most
      advanced forms remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, the extensive use of mammography within
      screening programs has led to cancers being detected earlier, when early treatments may be
      more effective. A greater understanding of the molecular biology and genetic expression of
      breast cancer has therefore led to new pre-surgical and post-surgical treatments, including
      hormone modulators and monoclonal antibodies. Many of these agents have led to decreased
      mortality and disease recurrence.

      F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv (single chain Fragment variable)
      format that is directed against tenascin C, an angiogenesis marker common to most solid
      tumors independent of the tumor type. ScFv(F16) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in
      animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving
      mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours.

      IL2, the human cytokine interleukin-2, is a potent stimulator of the immune response. It has
      a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such
      as natural killer cells, B cells, monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils (Smith, 1988). IL2 can
      induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell-mediated immune
      response in vivo (Rosenberg, 2000).
