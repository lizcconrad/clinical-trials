      Background: Skeletal muscle wasting or decrease in muscle mass occurs as a result of
      alteration in the body's mechanisms to make or break muscle protein. In animal models, the
      pathway termed as 'ubiquitin-proteasome pathway' (UPP) is primarily responsible for the
      regulation of skeletal muscle protein loss in wasting conditions and during
      infection(sepsis). Skeletal muscle wasting is noticed in patients having major surgery due to
      the inflammatory reaction triggered by special group of proteins called cytokines
      (inflammatory proteins), resulting in reduced muscle strength, impaired capacity to fight
      infections, change in bowel function, increased clinical complications and prolonged
      recovery. Major surgery also leads to decreased sensitivity to hormone known as insulin,
      resulting in 'diabeteslike'state.

      We hypothesize that susceptibility of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, to
      skeletal muscle wasting and insulin resistance, is determined by stress response to surgery
      over time, leading to changes in the pathways that make or break muscle protein, namely the
      Akt/Foxo signalling and UPP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish the underlying
      mechanisms of skeletal muscle wasting and insulin resistance in patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery.

      Experimental plan Fifteen adult patients undergoing major open elective abdominal surgery
      will be included in this nonrandomized study.

      Objectives:

        1. To study the expression proteins and metabolites involved in UPP mediated protein
           degradation, in blood and muscle biopsy samples.

        2. To correlate the effects of surgery on the release of bacteria in blood from the bowel.

      The analysis of the samples will include the following techniques, namely, RTPCR, ELISA,
      western blotting and metabolomics.

      Establishing the association between these signaling mechanisms and expression of the
      individual proteins secondary to inflammation following surgery and infection would enable
      application of suitable therapeutic strategies that could reduce the inflammatory response to
      benefit all patients undergoing surgery.
