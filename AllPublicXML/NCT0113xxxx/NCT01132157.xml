  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is the major cause of early renal dysfunction and acute
      renal failure of the transplanted kidney after renal transplantation. In 1986, Murry et al.
      described the phenomenon &quot;ischemic preconditioning&quot;. Also, it was reported that a few
      non-ischemic stimuli could provide cellular tolerance against major ischemia through a
      mechanism similar to ischemic preconditioning. In an animal study, 1 minimal alveolar
      concentration of volatile anesthetics - a clinically relevant concentration - was reported to
      have a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, the effect being variable
      between types of anesthetics. Also, there were somm reports that intravenous anesthetics such
      as propofol could reduce IR injury by decreasing oxidative stress and apoptosis.

      By reducing the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the grafted kidney, the morbidity and
      mortality related to renal transplantation can be reduced as well. The objective of this
      study is to find out whether, according to the type of anesthetics (Desflurane vs. Propofol),
      there is a difference in the protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury of the
      grafted kidney in patients receiving renal transplantation.
