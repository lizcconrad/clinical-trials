      To compare the outcomes of patients who undergo three different types of surgeries for ankle
      fusion and reconstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is understood that an elevated concentration of platelets in the mix of the arthrodesis
      construct applied intra-operatively to the bony surface, has osteo-generating and enhanced
      wound healing properties. With that knowledge there is a clinical need and enthusiasm for the
      application of concentrated platelets, which release a large quantity of growth factors to
      encourage recovery in non healing injuries or surgical sites. This study represents an effort
      to more clearly define the true clinical outcomes with or without biologic enhancement, and
      fulfills a need for fortifying evidence concerning the efficacy of ACP in live human bone
      healing-- based on radiographic and CT scans.

Depending on the randomization of the subject, ACP-A or ACP-DBM mixture will be added to the arthrodesis site with the joint taken through range of direct motion and then reduced.</description>

Autologous Concentrated Plasma: Autologous blood products have created a growing interest for use in a number of orthopedic therapies. The healing effects of plasma are supported by growth factors released by platelets. These growth factors induce a healing process wherever they are applied. The Arthrex ACP System is a cost-effective method of concentrating growth factors for therapeutic use.</description>
