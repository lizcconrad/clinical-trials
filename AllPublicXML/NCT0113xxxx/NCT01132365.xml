      Objective

      Describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients who undergo knee
      arthroplasty and document post operative outcomes.

      Examine the relationship between processes of care, hospital and surgeon associated outcomes.

      Provide expanded data to characterize existing and evolving practice patterns, delivery of
      care, and resource utilization in the management of knee arthroplasty patients.

      Analyze and design ancillary studies to address unanswered questions.

      Disseminate findings through publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
