      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the use of Transversus Abdominis Plane
      (TAP) blocks reduce early postoperative opioid requirements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Revision or closure of ostomy is a common elective surgical procedure at The Hospital for
      Sick Children. A retrospective audit conducted at SickKids demonstrated significant
      intraoperative opioid use and significant requirements for rescue opioids in recovery.

      Concerns exist regarding the relative merits of opioid use in abdominal surgery. Opioids may
      decrease bowel motility leading to the increased incidence and duration of postoperative
      ileus. They may be associated with increased rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting and
      pruritus. Lastly children may under-report their pain or pain may not be recognized by
      medical staff leading to inadequate provision of analgesia. This suggests that the use of a
      regional technique may benefit children undergoing revision of ostomy.

    <description>Pain scores will be assessed using the Faces-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolibility (FLACC) scale for children ≤ 7 years old (Appendix 2 of Protocol) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for children &gt; 7 years old. Pain scores will be determined by agreement between the PACU nurse and Anesthesia Clinical Research Nurse, both of whom will be blinded to the group allocation. Pain scores will be assessed at admission (time=0), 5, 10, 15, 30, and then every 15 minutes thereafter until discharge from PACU.</description>

    <description>A high frequency (5-10 mHz) ultrasound probe (Sonosite Micromaxx, Licence No 12407) will be placed on the flank at the midpoint between the iliac crest and lower costal margin. The three muscle layers of external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis will be visualized. A 22G short-bevel block needle will be advanced in an anterior-to-posterior direction, in-plane with the probe, until the tip is visualized in the transversus abdominis plane. After negative aspiration, 0.4 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be injected. The total dose of bupivacaine will not exceed 2 mg/kg and the total volume will not be more than 20 ml.</description>
