      The purpose of this study is to collect standardized data on the diagnosis and management of
      idiopathic (unknown cause) recurrent acute pancreatitis. The intent is to collect data for at
      least five years to obtain information regarding long-term outcomes and obtain comparative
      effectiveness data.

    <measure>IDIOPATHIC RECURRENT ACUTE PANCREATITIS (IRAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>The goal is to recruit 1000 subjects in 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Expect 750 to be treated with ERCP Expect 250 to be treated with conservative treatment. Therefore, the smaller group was used for the sample size analysis.
Smallest difference in QOL for treatment is expected to be 10-20%. For smaller of two treatment groups (N=250), no effect would be 0 got better and 250 did not. If 10% of the subjects improved, 25 would get better and 225 would not. Result: Chi-square analysis yielded a highly significantly difference as follows. Chi-square= 24.253 with 1 degrees of freedom. (P = &lt;0.001). Yates correction for continuity was used in calculating this test.An alternate analysis is that for no effect, 125 subjects would get better and 125 patients would not (random effects model).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years or older

          2. Able to provide consent

          3. More than one documented episode of pancreatitis (&gt;3 fold elevation of amylase and or
             lipase with abdominal pain or with body imaging consistent with pancreatitis: need two
             of the three)

          4. Subjects with abdominal pain and enzyme elevation which is &lt;3 fold above normal or
             absence of imaging findings: these subjects who are undergoing endoscopic
             interventions but do not fit the &quot;classic criteria&quot; for pancreatitis will be included
             but the analysis of data of these subjects would be done separately.

        Note: subjects with a diagnosis of pancreas divisum and or Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
        diagnosed prior to or after entry into the study will be included in the study but their
        data will be analyzed separately because of the controversy regarding the association of
        these entities with pancreatitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to give informed consent.

          2. Definite evidence of biliary or alcoholic pancreatitis.

          3. Clear evidence of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis (triglycerides &gt;1,000
             mg/dl).

          4. Post-ERCP pancreatitis, drug-induced pancreatitis, or any identifiable cause for
             pancreatitis.

          5. History of pancreatic surgery.
