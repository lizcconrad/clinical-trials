      A comparative,randomized (1:1)study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a new
      chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA) and chromatographically
      purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA)which is filled by Queen Saovabha Memorial
      Institute (TRCS SPEEDA)vs. reference vaccine (purified vero cell vaccine; VERORAB)when using
      with post-exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without equine rabies
      immunoglobulin.

      Rabies is an important world health problem especially in developing countries.Although the
      case-fatality ratio of human rabies is 100%,the disease is preventable by the modern
      cell-culture vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin.Post-exposure rabies vaccination with the
      modified Thai Red Cross intradermal(modified TRC-ID)regimen has been approved by WHO and
      proven to be immunogenic and effective. It represents a significant saving in vaccine cost
      and is now established in several developing countries. SPEEDA,chromatography purified vero
      cell derived rabies vaccine,approved by Thai FDA on 8 April 2009 and drug registration code
      of SPEEDA is 1C 90022/51. This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity and safety of
      SPEEDA and TRCS-SPEEDA (SPEEDA which is filled by Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute)vs.
      reference vaccine (purified vero cell vaccine; VERORAB)when using with post-exposure rabies
      intradermal vaccination with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin.

    <description>For modified TRC-ID regimen,0.1 ml of SPEEDA, TRCS SPEEDA or VERORAB will be given at each of two sites,intradermally on upper arms on days 0,3,7 and 28.
For ESSEN regimen, 1 vial of SPEEDA will be given intramuscularly at upper arm on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.
For ERIG,it would be given in a single dose 40 IU/Kg at the same time as the first dose of vaccine. ERIG will be infiltrated around and into all wounds as recommended by WHO for patients in group IV and injected intramuscular at each of both gluteal areas for participants in group III,V,VI</description>
