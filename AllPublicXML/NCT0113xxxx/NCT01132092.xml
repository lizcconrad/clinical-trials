        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  hearing thresholds less than 25 dB at all frequencies of pure tone audiometry, with
             differences between the ears, by frequency, or less than 10 dB.

          -  The group with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was made up of adults with hearing
             thresholds changed from 25 to 60 dB HL for the frequencies 2000-8000 Hz for pure tone
             audiometry.
