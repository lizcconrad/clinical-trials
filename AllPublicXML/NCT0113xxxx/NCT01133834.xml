      Objectives:

      Meningococcal disease (MD) is a complex catastrophic phenomenon that can converge rapidly to
      irreversible septic shock, myocardial dysfunction, and profound coagulopathy. During
      meningococcal sepsis and meningitis, a myriad of cells release cytokines within the
      intravascular environment and subarachnoid space. Cytokines are key molecular messengers that
      play key roles in orchestrating and mediating the metabolic, endocrine and coagulation
      responses to meningococcal infection. The aim of the present study is to determine the
      profile of different cytokines in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during MD, as well as relate
      the level of these cytokines to severity of MD.

      Design:

      Prospective, nonrandomized study.

      Setting:

      Tertiary referral intensive care unit.

      Patients:

      Children and adults admitted with a clinical diagnosis of MD. Interventions: Blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid will sample from children and adults with MD.

      Meningococcal disease (MD) is a complex catastrophic phenomenon that can converge rapidly to

      responses to meningococcal infection. The aim of the present study is to determine the
      profile of different cytokines in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during MD:

      IL -4; IL-6; IL-10 and interferon alfa, as well as relate the level of these cytokines to
      severity of MD, evaluated by occurrence of shock, acute renal failure, disseminated
      intravascular coagulation and survival.

      Design: Prospective, nonrandomized study. Setting: Tertiary referral intensive care unit.
      Patients: Children and adults admitted with a clinical diagnosis of MD. Interventions: Blood
      and cerebrospinal fluid will sample from children and adults with MD.
