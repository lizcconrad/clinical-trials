  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the complete remission of erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease with pantoprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily versus esomeprazole 40 mg once
      daily during four-week treatment with an extension treatment for non-responding patients. The
      study includes a baseline period up to 14 days and a treatment period of either 4 weeks (28
      -2 + 5 days), or 8 weeks depending on the cure of esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux.
      The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of pantoprazole magnesium.

    <description>A patient is considered at complete remission if he/she achieved symptoms relief and confirmed endoscopic healing at treatment end. A patient achieves symptoms relief if Reflux Questionnaire-GI score ((ReQuest™) stays below 1,73 for at least the three last consecutive treatment days, that can occur at visit V2 or visit V3 for those that did not achieve complete remission at V2 and repeated the treatment for 4 weeks more.</description>
