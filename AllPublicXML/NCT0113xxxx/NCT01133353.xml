  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the therapeutic effect of tetrabenazine MR in
      children with Tourette's Syndrome, as measured by the improvement in total tic score of the
      Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is typically diagnosed in early childhood (6-7 years) or before the
      age of 21 years and is characterized by chronic, intermittent motor and phonic tics. There is
      a body of evidence, mostly from the clinical experience data, suggesting the efficacy of
      tetrabenazine in TS patients with tics, including patients who were unresponsive to other
      treatment options. These publications consistently report the usefulness of tetrabenazine as
      an alternative to conventional neuroleptics for the treatment of TS.
