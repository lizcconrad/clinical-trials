      This study is to investigate the add-on effect of high dose NAC (600mg tablet twice daily) on
      reduction of airtrapping and airway resistance in stable COPD patients as well as to study
      it's effect in reducing exacerbation, improving exercise capacity and quality of life in
      stable COPD patients.

      Background: The mucolytic and antioxidant effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be of great
      value in treatment of COPD patients. However, previous studies fail to demonstrate the
      beneficial effect of NAC. This may be due to insufficient dose of NAC used as well as
      inadequate outcome parameters measured in the past studies.

      Objective of study: This study is to investigate the add-on effect of high dose NAC (600mg
      tablet twice daily) on reduction of airtrapping and airway resistance in stable COPD patients
      as well as to study it's effect in reducing exacerbation, improving exercise capacity and
      quality of life in stable COPD patients.

      Study design: Randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial in Kwong Wah Hospital

      Methodology: Patients are recruited in Kwong Wah Hospital if they fulfill the spirometric
      criteria of COPD. Eligible subjects will be randomized into the treatment (NAC 600mg tablet
      twice daily) and placebo group after completion of run in period. NAC and placebo will be
      prescribed accordingly in addition to their usual therapy. Both patients and investigators
      are blinded about the group allocation. Baseline assessment will be done and patients will be
      followed up at 16th weeks and 52th week of the study.

      During each follow-up visit, hyperinflation parameters like inspiratory capacity (IC) will be
      measured by plethysmography. Airway resistance will be measured by both plethysmography and
      impulse oscillometry machine. Exercise capacity (6 min walking distance) and quality of life
      are also recorded during each follow up.

      The difference of the above parameters between the 2 groups (drug and placebo group) will be
      analyszed by the Repeated measures ANOVA test
