    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the relative merits, safety and effectiveness of
      the EsophyX transoral device in performing an advanced TIF procedure in patients with
      &quot;troublesome symptoms&quot; as defined by the Montreal consensus definition while on PPIs compared
      with sham and placebo controls.

      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: A clinically significant reduction in GERD symptoms,
      specifically &quot;Troublesome&quot; regurgitation with or without heartburn assessed by the Reflux
      Disease Questionnaire (RDQ).

      Troublesome symptoms are those which occur a minimum of 2 days a week and are at least
      moderate in severity.

      Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint: The normalization of esophageal acid exposure at 6 months
      and a clinically significant reduction in PPI usage at 12 months.

    <time_frame>6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy hypothesis 1: At 6-month follow-up, the proportion of TIF2+Placebo pts who are free of &quot;troublesome&quot; symptoms will be statistically significantly larger than those randomized to the Sham+PPI treatment group.
Secondary efficacy hypothesis 1: At 6-month follow-up, with all patients off PPIs, the proportion of TIF patients with normalized esophageal acid exposure will be statistically significantly higher than the sham group.</description>

    <description>At 12-month follow-up, â‰¥ 50% of the patients randomized to TIF will have a clinically significant reduction in PPI consumption as compared with their pre-TIF consumption. Clinical significant reduction is defined as from daily use to occasional use or none at all.</description>

    <description>A novel surgical technique that creates a gastric fundoplication and restores competency of the gastroesophageal valve now exists for patients who have limited anatomic defects (small hiatal hernia). This technique is performed transorally using the EsophyX device (EndoGastric Solutions, Inc. Redmond, WA, USA) recreates a gastric fundoplication at the gastroesophageal junction by creating a flap valve at the intersection of the stomach and the esophagus by deploying polypropylene SerosaFuse fasteners (EndoGastric Solutions)</description>

    <description>The Sham Procedure (control) will consist of an upper GI endoscopy that will be conducted under general anesthesia in an operating room. The surgical team will follow the same steps before, during, and after the sham procedure similar to the TIF procedure, except they will never insert the EsophyX device into the patient. The endoscope will be manipulated for 30-45 min as if the device were around it to simulate the effect of many rotations and manipulations on the esophagus.</description>
