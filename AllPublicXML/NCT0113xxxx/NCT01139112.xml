      This is a retrospective descriptive study on the clinical and microbiological features of
      Klebsiella Pneumoniae Necrotizing Fasciitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening infectious
      disease that primarily involves soft tissue. Traditionally, group A streptococcus is the
      major cause of this disease. In recent years, however, there are increasing case reports of
      necrotizing fasciitis solely caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. There are limited data
      regarding clinical and microbiological features of K. pneumoniae strains causing this
      disease.

      Methods. We plan to review the medical records of necrotizing fasciitis cases treated during
      1997-2010 at National Taiwan University Hospital, and compare the clinical features of cases
      caused by K. pneumonia and cases caused by group A streptococcus. We also plan to
      retrospectively identify necrotizing fasciitis-associated K. pneumoniae strains stored at
      -80oC at National Taiwan University Hospital, and perform virulence-associated
      hypermucoviscosity phenotyping, wzy (magA locus) and rmpA genotyping, and detection of 20-kb
      kfu/PTS genomic region and other iron-uptake systems.

      Expected Results. This study is expected to yield the following important information: (1)
      The prevalence of monomicrobial K. pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis cases among all
      necrotizing fasciitis cases at our hospital during the study period; (2) The distinct
      clinical features of K. pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis, using group A streptococcal
      necrotizing fasciitis as the comparison group; (3) The microbiologic characteristics of K.
      pneumoniae strains causing monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, including hypermucoviscosity
      phenotype, wzy (magA locus) and rmpA genotype, and the presence of iron-uptake systems.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Definitive diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis depends on intra-operative findings
             characterized by a lack of resistance to blunt dissection of the normally adherent
             fascia, presence of necrotic fascia, and purulent malodorous discharge. Pathological
             findings of the involved fascia typically show neutrophils and bacterial clumps
             infiltrating between collagen bundles of with focal necrosis.
