  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that implementation of a comprehensive
      handoff program (CHP) - i.e., implementation of a computerized handoff tool along with
      teamwork training for pediatric residents on inpatient units at Children's Hospital Boston -
      will lead to reductions in resident miscommunications / medical errors and improvements in
      workflow and experience on the wards.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following collection of baseline data on two inpatient pediatric wards, teamwork training is
      to be provided to all pediatric residents. On our primary intervention unit, this will be
      accompanied by the introduction of a new computerized handoff tool that facilitates accurate
      transmission of data. The effects of this combined intervention on safety and workflow will
      be assessed on the primary intervention ward as compared with the historical control unit and
      the concurrent unit that received teamwork training without the computerized tool.
