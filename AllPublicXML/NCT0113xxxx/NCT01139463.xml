  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood lactate levels in patients receiving typical or atypical antipsychotics have not been
      described in the literature.

      The goal of this study is to assess the dynamics of lactate levels in the blood from typical
      or atypical antipsychotics not confounded by prior antipsychotic treatments, the
      investigators conducted a prospective study of lactate levels in patients receiving
      antipsychotic medication. The investigators hypothesized that 6 months of treatment with
      haloperidol or olanzapine would result in a change in blood lactate levels and extrapyramidal
      side effects.

      The aim of this study was to compare the blood lactate levels in patients receiving typical
      or atypical antipsychotics.

      Subjects included sixty patients with psychotic disorder were assigned to treatment for 6
      months with haloperidol (typical antipsychotic), N=30 or olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic),
      N=30. Blood lactate levels, other metabolic parameters, and scores on the extrapyramidal
      symptom rating scale (ESRS) were assessed.
