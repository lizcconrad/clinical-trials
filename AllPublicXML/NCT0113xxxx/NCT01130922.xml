  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roux-and-Y gastric bypass is one of the most common forms of bariatric surgery; due to a
      reduction in size of the stomach and intestine, the available surface area for the absorption
      of oral drugs is strongly decreased. This may lead to a reduced bioavailability resulting in
      a reduced efficacy of the drug. However, in literature there is no information available
      about the impact of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. This protocol
      evaluates the moxifloxacin plasma levels, the variability between subjects and the absolute
      bioavailability, after oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin in healthy volunteers who
      have had a gastric bypass at least 6 months ago and who now have a stable body weight.
