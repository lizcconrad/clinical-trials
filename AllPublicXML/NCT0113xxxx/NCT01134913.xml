      This is a prospective clinical study designed to procure blood samples from patients who
      present to the Emergency Department with suspected ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome).

      Subjects enrolled in this study will sign and informed consent and have 4 blood samples drawn
      at different time points during their emergency department visit. In addition, data will be
      collected about the patient's health history, hospital procedures, and final diagnosis. The
      enrolling center will also contact the patients at 30-days, 3 months and 6 months to inquire
      about their condition and survival.

      Blood samples collected in this study will be sent to the sponsor organization for long-term
      storage and analysis in the future for novel blood markers as they become available. No
      genetic testing will be conducted on these samples.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, and sample procurement study of adult
      subjects presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in whom ACS is in the differential
      diagnosis. Subjects must present to one of the participating EDs within 6 hours or less from
      the time of symptom onset, and must have experienced at least 5 minutes of chest discomfort.

      Those ED patients with possible ACS who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      approached for study enrollment by trained research personnel.

      The patient's diagnostic work-up and treatment will continue per the standards of the
      treating institution. As indicated by their clinical presentation, it is anticipated that all
      patients in this study will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) upon admission to the ED and if
      the patient is found not to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), objective
      cardiac testing will be conducted for evidence of MI. The Principal Investigator at each site
      will evaluate the results of the objective cardiac tests combined with biomarker evidence of
      myocardial necrosis to determine whether or not a patient enrolled at their site has a final
      diagnosis of ACS.

      Cardiac events and procedure, such as angioplasty-stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery
      (CABG), will be recorded during the index ED visit, hospitalization and post-hospital
      follow-up period. Subjects will have a 30-day, 3 month and 6 month follow-up contact by phone
      or medical chart review to collect this information on cardiac events, procedures and
      survival.

      Blood samples collected at several time points during the index ED visit will be used for
      future testing of novel blood markers as they become available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is 18 years of age or older at time of enrollment.

          2. Patient presenting to the ED within 6 hours from the onset of symptoms consistent with
             ACS.

          3. Subject presented with at least one symptom outlined below:

               1. Chest discomfort of at least 5 minutes duration from time of symptom onset.
                  Episodic or stuttering chest discomfort is acceptable if last episode preceding
                  the ED presentation is within 6 hours of symptom onset.

               2. Chest discomfort of shorter duration due to pharmacologic intervention.

               3. Ischemic Equivalent, Chest Pain Syndrome, Anginal Equivalent, or Ischemic ECG
                  Abnormalities.

          4. Physician plans to perform objective cardiac testing as defined by the protocol in
             Section 3.2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient (or Legal Representative) unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.

          2. Patient (or Legal Representative) refusal of telephone follow-up or medical record
             review at 30 days, 90 days and 180 days post-ED presentation.

          3. Patient (or Legal Representative) refusal for multiple blood sample collections over
             the study period.
