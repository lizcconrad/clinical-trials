    <textblock>
      In this study, a new chemotherapeutic agent, panitumumab, will be tested in combination with
      another chemotherapeutic drug, capecitabine, along with external radiotherapy, to find out
      whether this combination is effective and safe to use before surgery.

    <textblock>
      Surgical resection remains the standard procedure for patients with localized resectable
      pancreatic cancer.

      Neoadjuvant or preoperative therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been proposed
      as an alternative approach in patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Advantages are: 1) early start of systemic therapy targeting micrometastatic disease; 2)
      increased compliance with chemoradiotherapy; 3) increase primary tumor complete resection
      rates; 4) avoidance of surgery in patients with rapidly developing metastatic disease; and 5)
      importantly, it provides an important resource for research in terms of tissue acquisition
      before and after therapy . Finally, this is an opportunity to test the safety and efficacy of
      a novel combination of weekly panitumumab, oral capecitabine and radiation in pancreatic
      cancer.

    <description>Patients will receive six weekly doses of panitumumab (2.5mg/kg) in conjunction oral capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO bid Mon-Friday and external beam radiation therapy. Panitumumab and oral capecitabine will begin on the first week of external beam radiotherapy and will continue throughout the course of external beam radiation therapy, and will be discontinued following the conclusion of external beam radiation therapy.
Patients will be reevaluated for surgical resection 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.
After surgical resection, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine for six months is strongly recommended for all patients.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytological or histological confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is required.

          2. Only patients with localized and apparently resectable, non-metastatic tumors are
             eligible. All patients must be staged with a chest X-ray or chest CT and abdominal and
             pelvic CT scan or MRI.

             One of the following radiological criteria must be met and recorded in chart by
             dedicated surgeon prior to enrollment.

             A)Localized, potentially resectable : 1) no evidence of tumor extension to the celiac
             axis, hepatic artery or superior mesenteric artery; 2) no evidence of tumor encasement
             or occlusion of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or the SMV/portal vein(PV) confluence;
             3) no evidence of visceral or peritoneal metastasis

             B)Borderline resectable: 1) no extra pancreatic disease, (2) the following possible
             tumor-vessel relationships: an SMV-PV confluence that can be reconstructed even if
             short segment venous occlusion is present; tumor abutment of the SMA of ≤180°; or
             short segment encasement of the hepatic artery amenable to resection and
             reconstruction.

             Patients with the following radiological criteria are NOT eligible:

             A) Locally advanced disease: (1) no extra pancreatic disease, (2) tumor encasement of
             the SMA or celiac axis defined as tumor involvement of &gt;180° of the arterial
             circumference. B) Radiographic evidence of distant organ or peritoneal metastases.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years.

          4. ECOG performance status 0 and 1.

             situ of the cervix.

          2. Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.

          3. Serious medical illness which would limit anticipated survival to &lt; 12 weeks.

          4. Protocol treatment would pose significant risk to an unborn child. Pregnant women
             should not be enrolled, and women of child-bearing age should be strongly encouraged
