  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension to a previous research trial testing SABER™-Bupivacaine (an experimental
      pain-relieving medication). The purpose of this extension trial is to assess whether
      treatment with SABER™-Bupivacaine or SABER™-Placebo has had any effect on healing of the
      participant's shoulder, wound, or the skin near their scar. This trial will also assess
      safety (side effects).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research trial will involve all available subjects who received treatment in DURECT
      Protocol C803-017. All subjects will have the same follow-up safety assessments performed. No
      experimental treatment will be given in this trial. Subjects, Investigators, and caregivers
      will remain blinded to the treatment subjects received in the previous trial.
