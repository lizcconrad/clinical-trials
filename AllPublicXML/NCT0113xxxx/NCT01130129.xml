    <textblock>
      Consumption of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of
      cardiovascular disease and the protective effect may be due to polyphenolic compounds
      contained within these foods. The mechanism by which polyphenols exert this effect is not
      clearly understood but research has focused on their potential to affect platelet function.
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the anti-clotting activity of a range of plant food
      extracts and component compounds.

      A single sample of whole blood will be collected from 15 male or female volunteers aged
      between 18 and 65 years. After collection whole blood will be treated with a range of
      flavonoids to evaluate their effects on platelet function.
