  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flushes with saline solution are used for maintaining patency of peripheral intermittent
      intravenous catheters in many institution based on the results of previous studies showing
      that 10 U heparin/mL is not better than saline in this respect. The latest meta-analysis
      investigated also safety and efficacy of heparin concentrations of 100 U/ml used as an
      intermittent flush, but no firm conclusion was reached because of limitations of the few
      available studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phlebitis or Occlusion</measure>
    <description>Phlebitis is defined as the presence of two or more symptoms/signs among pain, tenderness, warmth, erythema, swelling, or a palpable cord (score of â‰¥ 2 according to the Visual Infusion Phlebitis Score). Occlusion is defined as resistance to flushing as evidenced by the inability to administer 1 ml of flushing solution within 30 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecchymosis</measure>
    <description>Ecchymosis is defined as a purple discoloration of the skin around the catheter insertion site larger than 1 cm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heparin induced thrombocytopenia</measure>
    <description>Heparin induced thrombocytopenia is defined as a fall in platelet count &gt; 50% of baseline value without any alternative explanation. To detect this phenomenon, platelet count is to be performed at baseline and, subsequently, every 5 days.</description>
