      The efficacy and safety of a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam compared to a single dose of
      cefuroxime at cord clamp for prevention of postcesarean infectious morbidity has not been
      assessed.

      Women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomized to receive a single dose of either 3g
      of ampicillin-sulbactam or 1.5g of cefuroxime intravenously, after umbilical cord clamping.
      An evaluation for development of postoperative infections and risk factor analysis was
      performed.

      The efficacy and safety of a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam compared to a single dose of
      cefuroxime at cord clamp for prevention of postcesarean infectious morbidity has not been
      assessed.

      The investigation was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      ampicillin/sulbactam 3g compared to a single dose of cefuroxime 1.5g in preventing
      postoperative morbidity. The primary outcome was development of an infection either at the
      surgical site or elsewhere e.g. urinary tract infection.

      A prospective randomized controlled study was performed from July 2004 to December 2008 in
      one major tertiary care hospital in Athens Greece. All patients undergoing a cesarean
      delivery were eligible.Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5g of cefuroxime,
      or 3g of ampicillin/ sulbactam intravenously after the time the umbilical cord was clamped.
