      This study is a Phase I trial of Darinaparsin in combination with CHOP for the treatment of
      lymphoma. Eligible patients will not have had any previous anti-cancer treatment and will be
      eligible to receive CHOP alone.

             untreated and are scheduled to receive CHOP alone. Since the objective of the study is
             the assessment of safety, eligible subjects may have any type of lymphoma (Hodgkin's
             or non-Hodgkin's, T-cell or B-cell), as long as the scheduled therapy is CHOP alone.

          -  Men and women of ≥18 years of age.

          -  Metastatic brain or meningeal tumors. -Patients with seizure disorder requiring
             medication (such as anti- branch block (LBBB); or documented history of prolonged QTc.

          -  History of confusion or dementia or neurological condition that could mask a potential
             adverse response to the Study Drug, which may include transient ischemic attack,
             Parkinson's disease, thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer's, and other
             neurological disorders.

             surgically, and non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of Study results.

          -  Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the patient and
             his/her compliance in the Study.
