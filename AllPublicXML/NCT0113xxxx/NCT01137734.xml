    <textblock>
      Annuloplasty device for repair of mitral valve regurgitation with option to adjust device
      post implant off pump, to optimize correction of mitral regurgitation. Unlike conventional
      annuloplasty ring, the Cardinal system offers the clinician the opportunity to make
      adjustments after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjustability is expected to reduce
      the number of patients leaving the operating room with residual regurgitation after mitral
      valve repair.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is a candidate for mitral valve repair.

          -  Patient able and willing to return to the implant center for follow-up visits.

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent and follow protocol procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe organic lesions with retraction of chordate tendineae, severly fibrotic and
             immobile leaflets, severely deformed subvalvular apparatus.

          -  Evolving endocarditis or active endocarditis in the last 3 months.

          -  Heavily calcified annulus or leaflets.

          -  Congenital malformation with limited valvular tissue

          -  Patient requires mitral valve replacement.

          -  Previously implanted prosthetic mitral valve or annuloplasty ring/band.

          -  Patient requires aortic or pulmonic valve replacement or repair.

          -  Patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating.

          -  Patient has a major cardiac or non-cardiac disease, which in the investigator's
             experience produces an unacceptable surgical risk.

          -  Life expectancy of less than twelve months.

          -  Patient is participating in concomitant research studies of investigational products
