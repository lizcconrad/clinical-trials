      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of additional nursing instruction
      for the caregivers of newly diagnosed pediatric atopic dermatitis patients at the University
      of Missouri Dermatology clinic. Caregivers of children with atopic dermatitis will be
      randomized to one of two instruction/education procedures. The goal is to determine if
      improved retention of information by caregivers/parents of children with atopic dermatitis is
      associated with better patient outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>EASI administered by blinded investigator at the initial visit, prior to teaching intervention; EASI again administered by same blinded investigator at visit 2 (at 4 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index is used to document extent and severity of atopic dermatitis on child's skin at the beginning of the study and again at the follow-up visit. The purpose is to determine improvement or lack of improvement following teaching intervention by nurses in the dermatology clinic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (or Week 4 visit)</time_frame>
    <description>A 27 item written questionnaire will be given to the parent/caregiver at visit 2. This questionnaire tests the retention of information given at visit 1 to subjects in both arms of the study (treatment and control group).</description>
