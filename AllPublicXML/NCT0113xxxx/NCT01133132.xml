      This study will develop and test the benefits of a new ICCS (Interactive Cancer Communication
      System), a mobile Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (Survivorship CHESS) in
      colon cancer survivors. Survivorship CHESS will provide information, tools, and a support
      system based on our previous work with FRESH START and CHESS, two highly successful
      interventions that have promoted lifestyle change among cancer patients and survivors.
      Survivorship CHESS will be designed to help subjects develop 1) competence in information
      gathering, decision-making, and behaviors they are trying to change, 2) social support
      systems to help deal with the cancer experience, and 3) autonomy that comes with regaining a
      sense of control over their lives; this in turn, will help them adopt or maintain healthy
      lifestyle behaviors and improve their quality of life.

    <description>Once the consent, baseline survey and one week accelerometer data is received by the UW research team subjects will be randomized to one of the two study conditions. Subjects will be notified of their randomization. Subjects randomized to the Survivorship CHESS condition will be offered training on the smartphone and the CHESS system. The project director (and site research coordinators) will provide training on the smartphone either in person or over the phone. Additionally, an online tutorial will be included in the Survivorship CHESS intervention for subjects to refer to as needed. Participants will then be asked to complete four surveys one baseline and then three follow up surveys.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of stage I-III loco-regional colon cancer within the previous 12 months with
             no evidence of recurrence or new cancers. Participants may be recruited at any time
             after the initial diagnosis (up to 12 months). Baseline data collection will occur no
             earlier than 6 weeks after completion of adjuvant treatment

          -  At least 21 years of age

          -  Able to speak and read English (educational attainment of at lease 6th grade)

          -  Engaged in physical activities less than 8 metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) per week

          -  Not Homeless

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing medical condition(s) that preclude adherence to an unsupervised exercise
             program which includes subjects with severe orthopedic conditions or scheduled for a
             hip or knee replacement within six months; paralysis; end-stage renal disease;
             dementia; as well as subjects who have unstable angina or who have experienced a heart
             attack; congestive heart failure or pulmonary conditions that require oxygen or
             hospitalization within six months; or uncorrected vision or hearing problems or other
             ergonomic conditions that would preclude the use of the smart phone.
