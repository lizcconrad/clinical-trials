      The purpose of the investigators study is to compare the rates of childhood diarrhea at the
      community level before and after the rotavirus vaccination program in Le√≥n, Nicaragua. From
      preliminary studies, the investigators anticipate about a 28% reduction in diarrhea following
      the vaccination program among children who received the vaccine, and a smaller reduction in
      diarrhea among children who did not receive the vaccine, due to the effects of &quot;herd
      immunity&quot;. In addition, the investigators will collect stool samples from children who
      develop diarrhea in order determine the etiology of childhood diarrhea in the post-rotavirus
      immunization era.
