  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the overall burden to the participant (economic,
      quality of life, patients satisfaction and freedom from side effects) when treating Gram
      positive infections of the foot in diabetic adults with daptomycin versus vancomycin.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. to compare the overall economic burden of therapy of a daptomycin vs. a vancomycin based
           antibiotic regimen for diabetic foot infections in the outpatient setting

        2. to compare Quality of Life and patient satisfaction among recipients of a daptomycin vs.
           a vancomycin based regimen

        3. to compare the safety and tolerance (adverse experiences) of daptomycin vs. vancomycin
           based regimens

        4. to compare the efficacy (complete resolution of infection) of daptomycin vs. vancomycin
           based regimens

    <description>Based upon 2 economic parameters associated with the treatment of the infection (provider charges and out-of-pocket costs) from screening until Day 28. Provider charges, as documented in invoices submitted to the pt's. insurance company, will be collected for all activities and services provided by the physician's office,home infusion company, laboratory, etc. during the study period. Out of pocket costs will be captured in a pt. diary and will include any health related costs that are borne by the pt. during the study period. Costs and charges will be analyzed and reported separately.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>QOL and pt. satisfaction with the medication, the clinical care, and the overall experience of the infection and its therapy are captured using three study intstruments, which are described in more detail in the Data Collection Instruments section. These include two validated, standardized QOL instruments administred at Baseline, at two weeks and again at 4 weeks, and a pt. satisfaction survey administered at Baseline, 2 and 4 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-80 who are able to give informed consent and, who are likely to be able to
             participate through the full 28 day of the study.

          -  Previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus, requiring the use of insulin and/or oral
             hypoglycemic agents for glycemic control.

          -  The presence of an infection of one or both feet (defined as being distal to the
             superior-most point of the lateral malleolus), with some drainage, abscess or fluid
             collection that can be cultured, yet which as not been treated for greater than 24
             hours with prior oral antibiotic therapy within the last 48 hours, wand which does not
             include either a quinolone or linezolid. The foot lesion, in the opinion of the
             initial treating physician, is severe enough (either because of the lesion or because
             of the subject's diabetic control, vasculopathy, etc) to require intravenous
             antibiotics.

          -  A culture of the wound, either at the time of screening or within the 72 hours prior
             to screening, that yields a Gram positive organism that is shown to be sensitive (or
             is likely to be sensitive) to both vancomycin and daptomycin. This will include
             Staphylococcus aureus, (including MSSA and MRSA, but excluding VRSA), Enterococcus
             faecalis and enterococcus faecium (excluding VRE), streptococci, including Groups A
             and B, as well as other beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci, and Group
             D. A culture of coagulase negative staphylococci as the only Gram positive isolate
             will not be considered for participation. Cultures may be obtained as swab or fluid
             submitted for culture.

          -  Able to read and write in English with a proficiency suitable for completing the
             pharmaco-economic and quality of life questionnaires and diaries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No Gram positive bacteria identified in the infected foot, infection with a Gram
             positive organism that is resistant to one of the two study drugs, or infection with
             coagulase negative staphylococci as the only Gram positive organism isolated.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to either of the two proposed study agents, or to
             ciprofloxacin, if a second anti-microbial agent is necessary.

          -  Renal dysfunction, such that the study subject requires dialysis.

          -  The presence of active osteomyelitis in the foot.

          -  The presence of concomitant infections that would require antibiotic therapy in
             addition to that being prescribed for the foot infection.

          -  The presence of pneumonitis requiring antimicrobial therapy, regardless of the
             suspected etiologic organism.

          -  A history of drug induced ototoxicity (either auditory or vestibular).

          -  A history of previous or current vascular catheter-associated phlebitis.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  Alcohol or drug use which, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to interfere
             with the conduct of the study.
