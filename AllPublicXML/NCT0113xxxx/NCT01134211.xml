    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently wearing any spherical daily disposable lens in daily wear, daily disposable
             modality for at least 3 months prior to enrollment with the exception of the 2 study
             products

          -  Currently Wearing lenses at least 8 hrs/day and 5 days/week.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eye injury or surgery within twelve weeks immediately prior to enrollment for this
             trial.

          -  Pre-existing ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Currently enrolled in any clinical trial.

          -  Evidence of systemic or ocular abnormality, infection, or disease which is likely to
             affect successful wear of contact lenses or use of their accessory solutions as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Any use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Prior history of corneal or refractive surgery.

          -  Requires monovision correction.
