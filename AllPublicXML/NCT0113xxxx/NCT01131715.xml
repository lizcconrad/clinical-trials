  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pharmacist follow-up procedure is under development. Patients with coronary heart disease
      (CHD) is being followed up by a pharmacist for one year with three meetings; at discharge
      from hospital, after three months and after one year. The evaluation is basically based on
      quantitative measures as achievement of therapeutic goals, number of drug related problems
      detected, hospitalisations etc. However, the patients' own experience with the follow-up
      procedure cannot be evaluated using these measures. Thus, a qualitative approach is needed.
      In this study, a total of four patients participating in the follow-up will be included and
      interviewed. A semistructured interview guide will be used. Interviews will be taped,
      transcribed and analyzed with the intention to explore how patients experience the follow-up
      from the pharmacist. A thoruough content analysis will be performed. Patients included must
      have met the pharmacist at least twice. The pharmacist in charge of the follow-up will
      recruit patients and hand out study information. Patients will reply to the principal
      investigator of the study and thus kept anonymous for the pharmacist in charge of the
      follow-up. No pressure will be put on the patients to join, but it will be emphasized that it
      will help evaluating the procedure.
