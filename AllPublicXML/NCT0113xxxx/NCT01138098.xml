      This study will evaluate the persistence of immunity to hepatitis B 10 to 11 years after
      vaccination with Infanrix hexa™ or Engerix™-B and also the ability to mount an immune
      response to the challenge dose of Engerix™-B.

    <time_frame>One month after a challenge dose of Engerix™-B vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). All the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the Chemi Luminescence Immuno Assay (CLIA) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

    <measure>Number of Subjects With an Anamnestic Response to a Challenge Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one month after a challenge dose of Engerix™-B vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>The anamnestic response was defined as: at least (≥) a 4-fold rise in post-challenge dose anti-HBs antibody concentrations in subjects seropositive at the pre-challenge dose time point. - Post-challenge dose anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL in seronegative subjects at the pre-challenge dose time point. A seropositive/seronegative subject is a subject with anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥/lower than (&lt;) 6.2 mIU/mL. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). All the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the Chemi Luminescence Immuno Assay (CLIA) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis and the initial 3.3 mIU/mL seropositivity cut-off was revised into the new 6.2 mIU/mL cut-off.</description>
