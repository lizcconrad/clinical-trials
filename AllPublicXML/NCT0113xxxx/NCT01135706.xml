      The investigators propose to confirm that normotensive and hypertensive pulmonary arteries
      are fractal, as well as define if the FD correlates to disease severity when compared to
      available data such as six-minute walk and right heart catheterization measurements.

      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an insidious disorder that can occur in isolation or as a
      result of various other pulmonary and systemic conditions. If left untreated PH may progress
      to right heart failure and death. Numerous tests are suggestive but not diagnostic of PH
      including cardiac echo, pulmonary function testing and chest x-ray. Definitive diagnosis
      requires right heart catheterization that is invasive, costly and time consuming. The fractal
      dimension (FD) is an index of the space-filling properties of an object so that the closer
      the dimension is to the topological dimension in which the object is embedded, the greater
      the space filling properties. No investigations have been performed to analyze the fractal
      dimension of pulmonary arteries in patients with PH. We propose to confirm that normotensive
      and hypertensive pulmonary arteries are fractal, as well as define if the FD correlates to
      disease severity when compared to available data such as six-minute walk and right heart
      catheterization measurements.
