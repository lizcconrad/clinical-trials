      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from patients with Down
      syndrome and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether megakaryocyte differentiation agents comprising a Rho kinase inhibitor
           and a JAK3 inhibitor can lead to proliferation arrest, polyploidization, and terminal
           differentiation of blasts in specimens from patients with Down syndrome and acute
           megakaryoblastic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved specimens are cultured and treated in vivo (in mice) and in vitro with
      megakaryocytic differentiation agents comprising a Rho kinase inhibitor and a JAK3 inhibitor.
