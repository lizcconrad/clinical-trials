  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the changes in body weight between a
      technology-based system, an in-person behavioral weight loss intervention, and a combination
      of both during a 12 month behavioral weight loss intervention in adults. Sedentary, healthy
      overweight and obese adults will be recruited to participate. Assessments will be conducted
      at 0, 6, and 12 months. This is a randomized trial in which participants will be randomized
      to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), standard behavioral weight
      loss plus technology (SBWL+TECH), and technology alone alone (TECH).

    <description>Body weight will be assessed on a digital scale to assess change in body weight over the intervention period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cardiorespiratory fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12, months</time_frame>
    <description>A graded exercise test on a treadmill along with indirect calorimetry will be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. This will provide a measure of oxygen consumption and metabolic equivalents of work at the time of test termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This will provide a measure of lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral content, and percent body fat.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire and a portable device worn on the upper arm will be used to measure and quantify energy expenditure from physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>dietary intake</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be used to assess self-reported food intake. This will be used to estimate calories, dietary fat, protein, and carbohydrates consumed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>psychosocial and behavioral measures</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires will be used to assess self-efficacy for weight loss and physical activity, barriers to physical activity and weight loss, expected outcomes resulting from physical activity and weight loss, perceived body image, depressive symptomotology, weight history, dietary disinhibition and restraint, and behaviors typically related to weight loss (e.g., self-weighing, meal planning, etc.).</description>

          -  Currently being treated for coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
             or cancer.

             mmHg or currently taking any medications that affect blood pressure or heart rate
             (e.g. beta blockers).

          -  Currently enrolled in a commercial weight loss program, participating in another
             weight loss study, or in a weight loss study in the last 12 months.

          -  Have lost &gt; 5% of current body weight in the past 6 months.

          -  Currently being treated for any psychological problems or taking any psychotropic
             medication.
