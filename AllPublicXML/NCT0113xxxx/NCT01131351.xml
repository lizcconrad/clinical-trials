      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered OPC-67683 when
           administered two times daily (BID) to MDR TB patients refractory to treatment with an
           optimized background regimen of anti-TB medications (OBR).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of OPC-67683 and metabolites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures

          2. Male or female patients aged between 18 and 64 years, inclusive.

          3. Able to produce sputum for mycobacterium culture or able to obtain sputum produced
             through Induction.

          4. At least three sputum mycobacterium cultures positive for MTB with in-vitro resistance
             to isoniazid and rifampicin during the previous 270 days (9 months) despite treatment
             with first and second line anti-TB drugs, including one positive culture within the
             previous 60 days from the time of sputum collection, prior to date of screening
             initiation (defined as the date the ICF is signed and screening begins).

          5. Sputum mycobacterial culture positive for MTB with in-vitro susceptibility to at least
             one anti-TB Medication within the previous 60 days prior to the date of screening
             initiation.

          6. Patient judged by the investigator to have potential for clinical benefit from
             OPC-67683 exposure.

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (for example, two of the
             following precautions: tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive implant,combined hormonal patch, combined injectable
             contraceptive or depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate) throughout the participation in
             the trial and for 22 weeks after last dose (to cover duration of ovulation).

             (AV) block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec (in both male and female
             patients), or of the QTcF interval over 450 msec in male patients and over 470 msec in
             female patients.

          5. Current clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder such as heart failure, coronary
             heart disease,uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, arrhythmia,
             tachyarrhythmia or status after myocardial infarction.

          6. For patients with HIV infection, CD4 cell count &lt; 350/mm3 or on treatment with
             anti-retroviral medication for HIV infection.

          7. Karnofsky score &lt; 50%.

          8. Any current diseases or conditions in which the use of nitro-imidazoles or
             nitro-imidazole derivates is contra-indicated.
