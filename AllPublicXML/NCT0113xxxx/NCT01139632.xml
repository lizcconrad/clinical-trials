      The most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD(Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) is
      CAD(Coronary Artery Disease). NAFLD patients have 65% more mortality than general population.
      The aim of the investigators study is to diagnose early coronary artery disease in NAFLD
      patient by measuring of PLA2. The investigators expect that PLA2 will higher in patients with
      patients with combination of CAD, unstable plaque and NAFLD.

      Background: The most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD(Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver
      Disease) is CAD(Coronary Artery Disease). NAFLD patients have 65% more mortality than general
      population. The aim of our study is to diagnose early coronary artery disease in NAFLD
      patient by measuring of PLA2.

      Methods: 60 patients with chest pain and low to intermediate risk for coronary events will
      undergo Cardiac CT and blood test measurement of enzyme PLA2, markers of inflammation: CRP,
      MDA(Malondialdehide), Paraoxonase, FFA(Free Fatty Acids), TG(Triglycerids) will performed.

      CAD is defined as a stenosis of more than 50% in at least one major coronary artery, unstable
      plaque defined as low attenuated plaque &lt;30HU and fatty liver defined as difference in liver
      and spleen attenuation value -10HU by using CT.

      Expected results : we expect that PLA2 will higher in patients with patients with combination
      of CAD, unstable plaque and NAFLD.
