      Do differences exist between patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of
      corticosteroid versus patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of hyaluronic
      acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post
      injection?

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary i. To determine if patients' VAS &quot;pain while walking&quot; is different at 6 weeks
      post-injection in patients who receive a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)
      versus patients who receive a single injection of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc One™) for treatment
      of knee OA.

      Secondary i. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain while walking&quot; scores exist at 1 and 3
      weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      ii. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain at rest&quot; scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3
      and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iii. To determine if differences in VAS &quot;pain with stairs&quot; scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks
      and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iii. To determine if differences in KOOS questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months and
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      iv. To determine if differences in WOMAC questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months, and
      6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      v. To determine if differences in adverse events exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, and 6
      months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

      vi. To track the number of patients who receive additional injections after 3 months
      following their index injection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome will be &quot;pain while walking for approximately 30 minutes on a flat surface today&quot; as reported by the patient on a 100mm unmarked VAS (0 = no pain; 100 = worst pain possible).</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS Form will be given at baseline (prior to injection) and then at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at rest or with stairs as reported byu the patient on a VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-injection), 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary Outcomes:
i. &quot;Pain at rest&quot; and &quot;pain with stairs&quot; as reported by the patient on a VAS
(Additional outcomes ii. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The KOOS is a valid, reliable and responsive questionnaire that is self-administered and consists of 5 subscales.
iii. The KOOS includes the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index LK 3.0 and thus, WOMAC scores will also be computed.
iv. Adverse events as reviewed and documented by the physician v. The number of subsequent re-injections or treatment strategies.)</description>
