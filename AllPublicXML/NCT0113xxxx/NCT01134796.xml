    <description>Primary outcome measures are: 1) The time elapsed between the start of grasp (when the finger breaks contact with the thumb) and the start of transport (when the wrist leaves the start position); and 2) The time elapsed between maximum aperture of the hand and peak deceleration of the wrist. Secondary outcome measures are: 1) movement duration, 2) time of maximum aperture expressed as % of movement duration, 3) time of peak deceleration expressed as % of movement duration, 4) amplitude of peak velocity of the wrist, 5) time of peak velocity, 6) time of peak velocity of the wrist expressed as % movement duration, 7) size of maximum aperture, 8) time to close hand from time of maximum aperture, 9) distance to target at time of maximum aperture.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Damage to the following areas of the brain, all of which may be involved in
             coordination of reach to grasp confirmed by CT scan: parietal, cerebellar, internal
             capsule and basal ganglia,

          2. A score of 6 or more on the arm section of the Rivermead Motor Assessment (able to
             reach and pick up a tennis ball and release on thigh),

          3. Time between start of hand opening and start of hand transport &gt; 60 ms (measured with
             GRASP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cognitive dysfunction which prevents understanding of the task,

          2. Severe concurrent medical problems that prevent repetitive reaching (including
             shoulder pain),

          3. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, or

          4. Lack of informed consent.
