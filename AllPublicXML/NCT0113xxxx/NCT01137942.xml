  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune response to Helicobacter pylori (Hp) importantly determines the pathogenesis of
      infection as well as the success of antibiotic eradication of the bacteria. The investigators
      want to demonstrate the importance of cathepsin X (CTSX), a cysteine protease, for the Hp
      eradication success. The diversity of the innate immune response to H. pylori antigens
      leading to either successful eradication of the infection or maintenance of chronic
      inflammation is connected to CTSX. The aim of this study is to determine whether H. pylori
      suppresses the CTSX expression and cytokine secretion in macrophage cell line THP-1 in the
      individuals that are not capable of eradicating the infection, opposite to H pylori in
      patients with successful H pylori eradication . The investigators also investigate the
      possibility whether strain-dependent differences in H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      influence the CTSX expression and cytokine secretion.

    <description>The investigators assume that vast majority of patients, that have problems with eradication of Helicobater pylori, not caused by primary resistence to antibiotics, can not eradicate helicobacter because of inappropriate immune response. The investigators will measure cathepsin X (CTSX) expression and assume that those patients who have low concentrations of CTSX also have inappropriate immune response seen in low levels of cytokines. To treat such patients, you need to give them different and longer antibiotic therapy.</description>

        The investigators invited people who had problems with H. pylori(Hp) infection. They were
        tested for Hp and if positive they were enrolled in the study.All patients were treated
        with appropriate therapy.3 months after antibiotic therapy, the patients were re-examined.
        The patients that had a positive test were invited to another re-evaluation.If H. pylori
        sensitive to all antibiotics tested was isolated, we enrolled the patient in the study-7
        patients. The investigators took the patient's first isolate and used it to prepare
        antigens for the study. All patients in the control group, 7 patients, were successfully
        cured with first attempt of antimicrobial therapy.Seven months after last patient enrolled,
        all the participants will be re-evaluated to see if they are still infected with Hp.
