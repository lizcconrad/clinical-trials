      Primary congenital glaucoma patients and their immediate relatives will undergo complete
      ophthalmic examination and an interview with a geneticist. A blood sample will be drown from
      all participants for DNA analysis.

      The CYP1B1 gene coding sequences will be screened for all individuals. If no mutation or only
      one heterozygous mutation will be found in the CYP1B1 gene, screening for MYOC gene mutations
      will be performed.

      Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is usually present in the neonatal or

      infantile period and is accompanied by corneal opacity and edema, buphthalmos, increased
      intraocular pressure, optic nerve cupping, and at times, ensuing severe visual impairment.
      The incidence of the disease varies significantly in different geographic regions and is more
      frequently found in certain ethnic groups, especially where consanguinity is prevalent. The
      incidence in Western countries has been reported to range from 1:5000 and 1:10000 births, and
      in populations where consanguinity is prevalent, such as among Slovakian Gypsies and Saudi
      Arabians, the incidence ranges from 1:1250 and 1:2500 births, respectively. PCG is believed
      to be an autosomal-recessive transmitted disease with incomplete penetrance. Three different
      loci have been mapped for it, i.e., GLC3A on chromosome 2p21, GLC3B on 1p36.2 and GLC3C on
      14q24.3. The major gene that currently has been identified to be associated with PCG is the
      CYP1B1 gene at locus GLC3A, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450. The frequency of
      mutations in the CYP1B1 gene in PCG patients varies in different geographic locations and
      ethnic groups. For example, mutations in the CYP1B1 gene are found in 33% of patients in
      Japan and Indonesia, while among Saudi Arabian and Slovakian Gypsy patients, the incidence
      rises to 94% and 100%, respectively. Mutations in myocilin (MYOC) have also been associated
      with PCG.

      Determining the presence of CYP1B1 mutations in PCG patients will improve our ability to
      counsel parents regarding cause, inheritance and the risk of it in future offspring.

      The aim of the present study is to characterize the phenotype and determine the role of
      CYP1B1 and MYOC mutations in PCG in Israeli populations

    <description>Mutations in the CYP1B1 gene were detected in 12 of 26 (46%) families with PCG (5 Muslim Arab, 5 Druze, 2 Jewish). Jewish families had compound heterozygous mutations, i.e. an Ashkenazi family had mutations in the CYP1B1 gene (Arg368His and R48G, A119S and L432V haplotypes), and an Ashkenazi-Sephardic family had a mutation on the CYP1B1 gene (1908delA, Sephardic) with a second missense mutation on the MYOC gene (R76K, Ashkenazi). Muslim Arabs and Druze tended to have a more severe phenotype than did the Jews.</description>
