             study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by
             the subject and/or her partner are: oral contraceptives, progestin injection or
             implants, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, IUD, vaginal spermicidal

             Females taking oral contraceptives must have taken them consistently for at least
             three months prior to receiving study medication.

          -  Hypersensitivity to amlodipine besylate (Norvasc®)or related calcium channel
             blockers).

          -  Any history of a clinical condition that might affect drug absorption, metabolism or
             excretion.

          -  Recent history of mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse or alcoholism.

          -  Donation of greater than 500 ml of blood in the past 4 weeks prior to study dosing or
             difficulty in donating blood.

          -  Received an investigational drug within the 4 weeks prior to study dosing.

          -  Currently taking any prescription medication, except for oral contraceptives, within
             the 7 days prior to study dosing or over-the-counter medication within 3 days of study
             dosing. This prohibition does not include vitamins or -herbal preparations taken as
             nutritional supplements for non-therapeutic indications as judged by the attending
             physician.

          -  Regular tobacco use in the 6 months prior to study dosing.
