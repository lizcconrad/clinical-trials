    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studies the side effects and best dose of giving veliparib
      together with temozolomide in treating patients with acute leukemia. Veliparib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib
      together with temozolomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of ABT-888
      (veliparib) administered in combination with temozolomide in patients with acute leukemias.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and toxicity of administering ABT-888 in combination
      with temozolomide in patients with acute leukemias.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document response in acute leukemias. II. To observe the pharmacokinetics of both
      ABT-888 and temozolomide when administered alone and in combination.

      III. To study the pharmacodynamics to determine the levels of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) before
      and after administration of ABT-888 and temozolomide in patient leukemia blasts, to analyze
      methyl-guanine methyl-transferase (MGMT) protein levels in primary leukemia blasts, and to
      quantify the induction of gamma-H2A histone family, member X (y-H2AX) and RAD51 recombinase
      (RAD51) foci in patient leukemia blasts after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1 and twice daily on days 4-12
      and temozolomide PO QD on days 3-9 of course 1.

      Beginning at least 30 days after the start of treatment, patients receive veliparib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-8 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving complete remission receive 5 more courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

               -  Untreated AML in adults 60 years of age and older who are not candidates for

                  regimens, including stem cell transplantation when applicable, can be enrolled on
                  this study

               -  Patients may have received any number of prior chemotherapy regimens, which may
                  include allogeneic or autologous transplantation, provided that performance

                  patients with advanced Ph+ ALL and CML in accelerated/blast phase are eligible
                  for this study, this short period off TKIs was selected to avoid rapid leukemia
                  progression; if using hydroxyurea, corticosteroids, or leukopheresis for blast
                  count control, patients must be off &gt;= 24 hrs before starting treatment on the
                  study

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days afterward; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous treatment with temozolomide

          -  Patients with active central nervous system leukemia are excluded from this clinical
             trial because they may develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound
             the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; patients with a history of
             central nervous system (CNS) leukemia but no active disease at the time of enrollment
             are eligible

          -  Hyperleukocytosis with &gt; 30,000 blasts/ul; (if using hydroxyurea, corticosteroids, or
             leukopheresis for blast count control, patients must be off &gt;= 24 hrs before starting
             treatment on the study); once patient starts treatment on the study the hydroxyurea
             use should be avoided, however, for patients with rapidly proliferating disease use of
             hydroxyurea is allowed on treatment days 1 through 12 if it becomes necessary to
             control a rising white blood cell (WBC) or leukostasis; the WBC need not reach
             30,000/ul to start hydroxyurea during protocol days 1-12; the decision to start
             hydroxyurea during this time is at the discretion of the treating physician

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ABT-888 or temozolomide used in this study

             controlled with antibiotics are eligible

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with ABT-888

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients (HIV testing will not be
             performed as a part of screening) on combination antiretroviral therapy, exclusive of
             zidovudine or starvudine, or HIV infected patients not on or willing to suspend
             antiretroviral therapy will be eligible provided that their cluster of differentiation
             (CD)4 cell count is greater than 250/mm3; HIV infected patients with CD4 count equal
             or less than 250/mm3 will be excluded
