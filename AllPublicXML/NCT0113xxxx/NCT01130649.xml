    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a novel method for tracking the seizure frequency, side effect
      burden, and medication compliance for patients with epilepsy. The investigators intend to
      utilize a table-top device currently for tracking other chronic disease to collect remote
      data from epilepsy patients. The hypothesis is that the use of this device will lead to
      better longterm treatment outcomes than the standard outpatient mechanism of following
      patients longitudinally.

        Patients will be recruited from the UCSF and VAMC Outpatient Epilepsy Centers. All study
        participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy (defined by two or more unprovoked
        seizures) for at least 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants must have a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy for at least 6
             months, based on the clinical judgement of the investigators. Epilepsy is defined by
             two or more unprovoked seizures. Clinical history, electroencephalography, and imaging
             data are all instrumental in rendering a formal decision. The seizure type, frequency,
             or severity are not criteria for exclusion, although this information will be
             recorded.

        Patient can range in age from birth to 65 years old; in cases of child participants, the
        parents are responsible for data reporting.

          -  Patients must have a seizure frequency of at least two seizures in a 6 month period of
             time.

          -  Patients must be on at least one anti-epileptic medication.

          -  Patients and/or legal guardian must be able to report seizure frequency with either a
             paper or electronic diary.

          -  Patients and/or legal guardians must be able to read and understand either English or
             Spanish.

          -  Patients and/or legal guardians must be able to complete questionnaires and provide
             informed consent to this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include: a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; severe
             depression, anxiety, or psychosis

          -  Recent problem with substance abuse.
