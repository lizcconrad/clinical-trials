  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed a prototype PET insert device that can be integrated into a clinical
      PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner to improve its image resolution to approximately 2.5 mm
      in all 3 dimensions within a reduced imaging field of view (FOV). This zoom-in imaging
      capability provides 6-fold improvement in volumetric image resolution over the current
      state-of-the-art clinical PET scanner, offering a tremendous opportunity for cancer imaging
      applications, in particular for those cases where a lymph node involvement will drastically
      alter the patient management plan. Accurate diagnosis and staging of head-and-neck cancer is
      known to be challenging because of the complex anatomy and large number of lymph nodes
      involved in this region. As a result, head and neck cancer imaging is an ideal candidate for
      evaluating the clinical usefulness of this novel imaging device.

      In this project, we propose to conduct an exploratory clinical trial to investigate the
      effectiveness of this novel imaging device in detecting small lesions and lymph node
      involvements in the head and neck region, and compare its results to those obtained from a
      clinical PET/CT scanner. More specifically, we propose to (1) recruit 5 patients who have
      confirmed head and neck cancer and are scheduled to receive a whole-body PET/CT scan followed
      by surgical operation to remove the primary tumor and the regional lymph nodes. These
      patients will be imaged by a state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner using the standard whole-body
      PET/CT imaging protocol as standard of care for initial staging. On another day, following
      consent to participate in this research protocol, A patient will undergo images of the head
      and neck region using the same type scanner with and without our novel PET insert device
      attached; (2) The images obtained from the PET insert device will be reviewed by experienced
      nuclear medicine physicians to identify the extent of lymph node involvement. The PET insert
      images will be compared to the standard clinical PET/CT images. A detailed image obtained for
      purposes of research, centered at the level of the head and neck, acquired for approximately
      3 times the length of time the standard clinical image is obtained for will also be compared
      to the PET insert image. Images will also be compared to the pathology report of the
      surgically removed specimen. (3) Estimate the performance of lesion detection for different
      sizes of tumors using the standard PET/CT scanner as well as the PET insert device.

  <condition>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</condition>
  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with suspected
        lymph node metastasis

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma
             of the head and neck with suspected lymph node metastasis. Subjects with histological
             confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma from a lymph node biopsy in the head and neck
             region for carcinoma of unknown primary would also be eligible.

          2. Patient must be scheduled to receive (or have already received) clinical whole body
             PET/CT scan from a Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner as their standard of care
             staging.

          3. Patient must be scheduled to receive surgical removal of the primary tumor and the
             regional lymph nodes. It is preferred that the surgery will occur within 21 days of
             research PET imaging.

          4. Age &gt;18 years, as head and neck cancer is extremely rare in children.

          5. Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) to
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          6. Not currently pregnant or nursing: Female subjects must be either surgically sterile
             (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy), or post
             menopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year). If of childbearing potential, a
             urine pregnancy test must be performed within the 24 hour period immediately prior to
             administration of 18FDG and determined to be negative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject weight will be limited to 250 lbs and below due to the size limitations of
             the prototype PET insert device.

          2. Subjects who are claustrophobic

          3. Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes (fasting blood glucose &gt;200mg/dL)

          4. Subjects with prior head/neck surgery or radiation as this may disturb the natural
             architecture of the tissues and impede the imaging analysis
