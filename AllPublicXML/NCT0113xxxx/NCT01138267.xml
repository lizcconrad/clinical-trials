      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphism on ARV drug levels

        -  To evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism/drug levels on long term immunologic and
           virologic response

        -  To correlate the genetic polymorphism/drug levels on antiretroviral toxicities

      The long-term objective of this research plan is to characterize impact of pharmacogenomics
      to HIV drug concentration, toxicities, and response to antiretroviral therapy among
      HIV-infected adults. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV
      infection and HIV medication will lead to the development of appropriate intervention such as
      dose reduction strategies in patients with particular gene(s) correlated with higher drug
      levels. The dose reduction strategy will decrease long term drug toxicity and cost saving for
      Thais and Asian Ethnicities.

      The overall goal of this study is to characterize role of pharmacogenomic on ARV drug
      (atazanavir, and efavirenz) levels, its toxicities, and its long term efficacy among
      HIV-infected adults in Thailand. The specific aims are (1) to evaluate the impact of genetic
      polymorphism on ARV drug levels (2) to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism/ drug
      levels on long term immunologic and virologic response (3) to correlate the genetic
      polymorphism/drug levels on antiretroviral toxicities. The proposed study will be analysed in
      stored samples of the well-established cohort of long-term follow-up study for HIV-infected
      patients participated in HIV-NAT study protocols, the HIV-NAT006 study. This cohort provide
      us unique opportunity to study impact of pharmacogenomics on long term treatment response and
      long term drug toxicities since this cohort was started in 1996. Furthermore, the important
      factors include ARV regimen, drug toxicities, PBMC, immunological and virological parameters
      have been collected every 6 months basis in HIV-NAT006 study.

      A comprehensive understanding of the impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV infection and HIV
      medication will lead to development of appropriate intervention, particularly, dose reduction
      strategy in patient with particular gene correlated with greater drug levels. The dose
      reduction strategy will decrease long term drug toxicity and cost saving for Thai and Asian
      Ethnicity.

      Patients are divided into 4 groups based on whether they need to redraw their blood.

        1. have adequate samples stored and do not need additional blood draws.

        2. have EFV or ATV blood concentrations samples stored but do not have samples for
           genotyping. Need extra 5-ml sample.

        3. have samples stored but the samples cannot be used to test for EFV or ATV blood
           concentrations because the time of drug intake and blood drawn are unknown. Need to
           redraw 5-ml sample.

        4. have never had both drug concentration and genotyping done. Need to give 10 ml of blood
           sample to perform both tests.
