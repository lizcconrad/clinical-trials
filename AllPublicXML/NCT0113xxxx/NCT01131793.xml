      A single center Pilot Clinical Registry Study of the&quot; Acute Procedural&quot; Safety and Efficacy
      of Stereotaxis PowerAssert(TM)RF Coronary Total Occlusion System assisted Angioplasty in the
      Treatment of Refractory Coronary Total Occlusions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determine the safety and efficacy of the Stereotaxis PowerAssertâ„¢ 18 RF Wire System:

      Primary - of recanalizing (crossing) coronary total occlusions within a stent.

      Secondary - facilitated angioplasty at hospital discharge represented by

        -  Event free survival

        -  Anginal status, and

        -  Target vessel patency

        -  minimal luminal diameter (MLD).
