    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, open-label, single-sequence drug interaction study to evaluate the
      effect of repeated doses of GSK2248761 on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin,
      and rosuvastatin in healthy adult subjects. In this study, approximately 14 subjects will
      receive single doses of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin on two occasions, once
      alone and once following administration of repeated doses of GSK2248761. Safety evaluations
      and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will
      occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.

             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary

             Screening and predose Day 1.

          -  Cardiac conduction abnormalities denoted by any of the following on a single 12-lead
             ECG at screening or predose Day 1 (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination). Including evidence of previous myocardial infarction (Does not include
             ST segment changes associated with repolarization). Any conduction abnormality
