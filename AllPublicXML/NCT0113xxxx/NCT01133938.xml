  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head following
      treatment of developmental dislocated hip have been reported. The need for further research
      with a large-enough sample size including statistical adjustment of confounders was demanded.
      The purpose of the present study was to find reliable predictors of osteonecrosis in patients
      managed for developmental dislocation of the hip and to evaluate if delayed treatment
      increased the risk of residual acetabular dysplasia requiring secondary surgeries.
