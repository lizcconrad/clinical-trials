        patients who presented to the hospital within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain who were
        admitted to the coronary intensive care unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of acute STEMI and
        who were administered primary PCI. Having acute STEMI for the first time was stipulated for
        inclusion in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chest pain that continued longer than 30 minutes and with ≥ 2 mm ST
             elevation in ECG at least in two adjacent derivations were diagnosed with an acute
             STEMI. In all patients, at least two-fold increases were seen in serum CK-MB levels
             compared to normal values.Having acute STEMI for the first time was stipulated for
             inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known allergies to aspirin and clopidogrel, inadequate echocardiographic
             images, malignancy, a previous cerebrovascular event, renal dysfunction (creatine
             level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl), a previous MI, or a history of cardiogenic shock as well as those
             who refused to participate in the study were excluded.
