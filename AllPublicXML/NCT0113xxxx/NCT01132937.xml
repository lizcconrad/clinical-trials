  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to
      more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial
      treatment. To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care,
      researchers are interested in developing more standardized criteria for diagnosing and
      classifying different types of traumatic brain injury. By identifying imaging and other
      indicators immediately after the injury and during the initial treatment phrase, researchers
      hope to better understand the nature and effects of acute traumatic brain injury.

      Objectives:

        -  To study the MRI results of individuals who have recently had head injury and suspected
           traumatic brain injury.

        -  To study the natural evolution of traumatic brain injury for up to 3 months after head
           injury.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been admitted to a hospital with a diagnosed
      or suspected traumatic brain injury within the past 48 hours.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have one 3-hour study visits: an initial visit (within 48 hours of
           head injury). Participants may be asked to have an optional 4-day, 30-day, 90-day, and
           1-year follow-up.

        -  Each visit may involve blood samples, an MRI scan (approximately 30 minutes), and a
           series of tests to evaluate brain function.

        -  At the optional follow-up visit, participants may have blood samples, an MRI scan, and a
           general traumatic brain injury assessment.

        -  This study does not provide treatment and does not replace any current therapies.
           However, participants who are eligible for other National Institutes of Health studies
           may be referred to these studies by researchers.

      Objective

      To generate natural history data for cohort-based comparisons to serve as the basis for
      future hypothesis-driven protocols and to contribute to the clinical and physiological
      understanding of traumatic brain injury (TBI) through the description of manifestations of
      the injury and the relationship among radiological, hematological, clinical variables and
      standard functional outcome measures.

      Study Population

      One thousand male and female adult subjects with history of recent head injury with or
      suspected non-penetrating acute TBI, will be enrolled. Subjects having varying degrees of TBI
      severity will be recruited from the collaborative programs between NIH and non-NIH hospitals.
      We anticipate approximately 80% of subjects will be classified as mild TBI, concussion, or no
      injury, with approximately two thirds of those subjects enrolled being discharged directly
      from the emergency department.

      Design

      This is a prospective cohort study of subjects with known and suspected non-penetrating acute
      traumatic brain injury. Subjects presenting to the emergency department or trauma service at
      participating hospitals with a history of recent head injury will be studied during the
      course of their hospital stay and after discharge using radiological, hematological, clinical
      and functional outcome measures. Subjects will be stratified according to findings into
      cohorts for comparison. The design is intentionally broad in scope to allow acquisition of
      initial data for the development of future hypothesis-driven protocols. Research performed
      under this protocol will not interfere with standard of care and subjects will not be treated
      with experimental therapies as part of the research study. Data collected under this research
      study may be shared without personal identifiers with other researchers if subjects approve
      this option on the informed consent.

      Outcome Measures

      A variety of outcome measures will be used including diagnosis, evidence of injury on
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), functional
      impairment, and quality of life (QOL) assessments. The initial research questions will focus
      on a positive diagnosis of brain injury and monitoring the natural history. Statistical
      analysis plans will be developed as specific research questions and hypotheses are generated.
