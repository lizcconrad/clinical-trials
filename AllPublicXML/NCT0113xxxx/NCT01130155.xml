  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally agreed that artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the malaria
      therapy of choice but there is much less agreement about the best ACT-deployment strategies.
      Countries are now beginning to adopt policies to enhance ACT deployment that aim to address 2
      key goals: (i) making ACTs more readily and speedily accessible to patients: or (ii)
      targeting ACTs to patients shown to have malaria parasitaemia.

      The Tanzanian Government has secured funding to address both ACT access and targeting on a
      national scale. Access is to be improved through the distribution of subsidised ACTs through
      private facilities and retail drug shops under the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria
      (AMFm). Targeting is to be addressed through enhancing microscopy and introducing rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) in health facilities at every level of the system.

      This study will evaluate these two interventions in 3 rural regions of Tanzania which are all
      expected to receive both interventions during the study period. The investigators will assess
      the effectiveness of the interventions in terms of coverage, equity, quality, adherence, and
      public health impact using a pre-post plausibility design based on before and after
      household, health facility and outlet surveys. The null hypothesis is that the interventions
      will have no impact on the coverage of prompt effective treatment for fever and malarial. In
      addition, the investigators will estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation
      from a health system and household perspective. Finally the investigators will explore the
      socio-cultural context and other factors that influence the implementation and outcome of the
      interventions.
