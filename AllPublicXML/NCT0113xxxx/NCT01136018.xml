  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal epidural block is useful not only for regional anesthesia of low abdominal, perineal
      area or lower extremities but for relieving acute or chronic pain of low back and lower
      extremities. Recently, there were some reports that there was a difference of the contrast
      flow pattern during lumbar epidural block according to a location of needle tip in the lumbar
      epidural space. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that there is a difference of
      contrast flow pattern in caudal epidurography when a needle is inserted with intentionally
      lateral direction.
