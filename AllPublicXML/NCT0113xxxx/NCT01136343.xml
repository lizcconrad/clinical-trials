  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease ranked the second and third of ten
      leading causes of death in female in 2007; half of these deaths is due to coronary artery
      disease (CAD). Postmenopausal status is an independent risk factor for CAD. Early assessment
      and proper management of risk factors may reduce the prevalence rate of CAD. In the past
      decade, despite increased attention to CAD in women, most studies focused on certain
      menopausal status instead of all phases of menopause or on risk factors limited to related
      metabolic syndrome. Because the prevalence of risk factors related to CAD is influenced by
      various physiological and lifestyle status in different menopausal statuses, the purpose of
      this study, at the first stage, is to explore respectively the risk factors of CAD among
      middle-aged women in three menopausal statuses. At the second stage, the influence of a
      lifestyle management program on risk factors modification among pre-menopausal women is
      examined in this study.
