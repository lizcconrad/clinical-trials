  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1 portion of this study is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      1-month depot TAK-448 in adult males with prostate cancer who are either on gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy or who might be eligible for GnRH therapy in the future. The
      phase 2 portion of this study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized study in men with
      prostate cancer that will confirm the testosterone- and prostate specific antigen (PSA)-
      lowering potential of up to 2 dose levels of 1-month depot TAK-448.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Male 40 to 72 years of age

          -  Histologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate having completed primary local
             treatment at least 6 months prior to screening

          -  Meet all laboratory evaluation values at screening as specified in protocol

          -  For phase 1 of the study only: Concurrent gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
             therapy with generally indolent or stable disease OR a potential candidate of GnRH at
             some time in the future. Patients with metastatic disease must be asymptomatic with
             only bone scan positive evidence of metastases. Patients with recurrent local disease
             will be asymptomatic without bladder, bowel or obstructive symptoms

          -  For phase 2 portion of the study only: evidence of progressive prostate cancer, which
             in the opinion of the referring physician and/or study investigator warrants the
             initiation of GnRH analog therapy. Such patients may have either elevated or rising
             PSA at least 6 months following primary local therapy (ies) or have evidence of
             metastatic disease not previously treated with GnRH analog therapy.

             than prostate cancer, affecting 2-year life expectancy

          -  Ability to understand and comply with protocol requirements

          -  Agreement to, even if surgically sterilized but not surgically castrated, practice
             effective barrier contraception OR abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  Suitable venous access for blood sampling

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of nonskin cancer, other than prostate cancer, requiring active treatment
             within 2 years of screening

          -  History of cardiac surgery, within the previous 6 months or any planned elective
             surgeries, other than skin surgery, during the ensuing 6 months

          -  Compromise of bone marrow function that would reduce tolerance to repeated blood draws

          -  History of osteoporosis, unless actively controlled with treatment, or history of
             vertebral or femoral fracture within the past year

          -  History of seizures or currently on anticonvulsant medications

          -  History of major psychiatric illness (diagnosed psychosis or psychiatric illness

             infection

          -  History of significant cardiovascular condition

        In addition, for the phase 2 portion of the study, patients must not have any of the
        following exclusion criteria:

          -  Participation in the phase 1 portion of the study

          -  Prior or current use of a GnRH analog or androgen receptor antagonist as first-line
             hormone therapy (other than as neoadjuvant/adjuvant use)

          -  History of use of GnRH analog or antagonist (as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy)
             within the 6 months prior to screening

          -  History of known or documented primary failure of GnRH analog therapy

          -  History of rising PSA or disease progression while on a GnRH analog or combined
