      Introduction:

      Vibration has been used to enhance muscle strength development during resistance training.

      Aim:

      To assess the effect of adding vibration to a regular resistance training program, using free
      weights, on muscle strength and everyday functioning of upper limbs in untrained adults

      Methods:

      60 healthy untrained adults, 30-65 yrs, will divide into two groups: experiment and control.
      Training program will include 24 sessions, over a course of 8 weeks. The experiment group
      will use a 1 kg vibrating weights and the control group will use a standard 1 kg free
      weights. Every session will include 10-15 min of 3-5 standard resistant exercises for upper
      limbs. Each subject will perform an Isokinetic evaluation of muscular performance, for upper
      limbs, in 3 occasions: before starting the program, immediately after completing the 8-weeks
      training program and 4 weeks afterwards, to check the chronic effect of each training regime.
      Each subject will complete a DASH (Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) questionnaire
      at 4 occasions- as mentioned above and one more time, when completing the first 4 weeks of
      the training program, to reject any development of negative effects of the training program,
      such as pain or inflammation of the joints .
