  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determinate the effect of a pre-treatment with centrally
      acting alpha2-receptor agonist clonidine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;). The investigators hypothesize that
      clonidine will attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;ecstasy&quot;) is widely used by young people for its
      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine. It is
      unknown which of these monoamines mainly contributes to the subjective and physiological
      effects of MDMA in humans. Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2-receptor agonist and
      sympatholytic which attenuates the release of NE from presynaptic nerve terminals and also
      lowers NE plasma concentration. To determine the role of NE in the response to MDMA in humans
      we test the effects of a clonidine pretreatment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
      of MDMA. We use a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design with four
      experimental sessions. Clonidine (150 μg) or placebo will be administered 1 h before the
      administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and
      cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma
      samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. We hypothesize that clonidine will significantly
      attenuate predominantly the cardiovascular response to MDMA.
