      The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ),
      including the possible association with bisphosphonates (BPs). This study used the research
      infrastructure from the three NIDCR-funded dental practice-based research networks (DPBRN,
      PEARL, PRECEDENT). De-identified data from the DPBRN were merged with comparable
      de-identified data from PEARL and PRECEDENT to form a single trans-PBRN data set used for
      analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study were to (1) test the hypothesis that (BP) treatment is a risk factor
      for (ONJ); (2) to test the hypothesis that dental diseases (particularly periodontal
      disease), and invasive dental procedures such as dental extractions are true risk factors for
      (ONJ).
