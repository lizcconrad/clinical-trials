  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To meet the requirement for increased patient involvement, several Community Mental Health
      Centres (CMHC) have initiated a service called &quot;patient-guided admissions&quot;. The investigators
      will compare a group with &quot;patient guided admission/self-referral to inpatient beds&quot; with a
      group having treatment as usual.

      It is expected that patients in the intervention group will experience more increased feeling
      of coping (patient activation) after 4 months and 12 months as a result of participating in
      &quot;patient-guided admissions&quot; than patients getting treatment as usual. In addition the total
      number of inpatient days either in the CMHC, psychiatric hospital or community rehabilitation
      centre is expected to be clearly lower in the intervention group than in the
      'treatment-as-usual' group during one year after intake. Also the number of involuntary
      admissions either as inpatient or outpatient will be significant lower in the intervention
      group than the 'treatment-as-usual' group.The number of admissions in CMHC and psychiatric
      hospital, as well as the number of outpatient consultations in primary care, CMHC and
      psychiatric hospitals, will be lower in the intervention group than in the
      'treatment-as-usual' group. Patients in the intervention group will experience improved
      mental health, increased feeling of coping (patient activation) and increased experience of
      recovery after 4 months and 12 months as a result of participating in &quot;patient-guided
      admissions&quot;.

      Participants will be patients with psychosis or bipolar disorders. Patients in the
      intervention group will have a contract on &quot;self-referral to inpatient beds&quot; for one year.
      They can call the CMHC directly and ask for a bed for until 5 nights.

      The patients in the 'treatment-as-usual' group will follow common procedures by either
      contacting their general practitioner, emergency department or duty doctor, and they will be
      offered a &quot;self-referral to inpatient bed&quot; contract after a year if they satisfy the
      inclusion criteria.

      Regardless of the participation in the intervention group, the patients can also be ordinary
      admitted during the project period by a doctor via regular procedures in both hospital and
      CMHC if there is a need for this. All admissions will appear in the register data.
