  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease in Central Africa and pregnant women are
      frequently suffering from this condition. Mefloquine is currently investigated as preventive
      treatment against malaria in pregnancy and mefloquine is also known to exert activity against
      schistosomiasis. The investigators want to test the hypothesis whether mefloquine may active
      against urinary schistosomiasis when used as preventive treatment against malaria in
      pregnancy.

      Objectives

      The principal aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether mefloquine - when given as
      intermittent preventive treatment against malaria in pregnancy - shows in vivo activity
      against concomitant Schistosoma haematobium infection. This study is therefore a &quot;proof of
      principle&quot; study and is not intended to establish a clinically satisfying cure rate or to
      formally compare the efficacy of mefloquine with the standard therapy.

      Hypothesis

      Two underlying hypotheses have been formulated for this proof of principle study.

      Primary hypothesis: Mefloquine reduces egg excretion of Schistosoma haematobium by 50%
      compared to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) treatment when given as IPTp Secondary
      hypothesis: Mefloquine may lead to an adequate cure rates of Schistosoma haematobium
      infections compared to S/P (&gt;80%)

      Trial Design

      The evaluation of mefloquine activity against S. haematobium will be evaluated in the course
      of an open label multicenter randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy,
      tolerability, and safety of mefloquine IPTp against malaria. This study is therefore a nested
      randomized controlled trial taking advantage of the randomization and treatment allocation
      procedures of the IPTp trial and assessing the additional efficacy outcome of reduction of S.
      haematobium egg excretion.
