    <textblock>
      This study will describe the pharmacokinetic disposition of biologically active rabbit
      anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) after a consistent dose of 7.5 mg/kg/course given as part of
      the conditioning regimen in children undergoing hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a therapeutic option for
      patients with malignancies as well as metabolic and genetic diseases. Conditioning regimens
      given prior to donor cell infusion aim to ablate the recipient bone-marrow, to allow
      engraftment of the stem-cells infused, and to prevent acute versus host disease (aGVHD).
      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is one of the immunosuppressive drugs given as a preparative
      regimen for HSCT. Subjects will be given an ATG infusion daily for 3 days prior to HSCT and
      serum levels will be collected, as per schedule, with the last sample taken +100 days
      post-HSCT.
