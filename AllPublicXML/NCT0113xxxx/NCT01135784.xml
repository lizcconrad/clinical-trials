      The purpose of this study is to study MIGRA-ZEN RELIEF PLUS, an all-natural herbal dietary
      supplement product, with respect to alleviating and/or stopping migraine headache pain
      compared to a placebo when used prophylactically. This study will involve subjects suffering
      from chronic migraine headaches.

      The purpose of this 90-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of an all-natural herbal dietary supplement product, (Investigational Product,
      or IP), with respect to alleviating and/or stopping migraine headache pain compared to a
      placebo when used prophylactically every day, and to evaluate the safety/risk of its use by
      observing the absence/presence of adverse event (AE/SAE) reports and the normalcy of blood
      work, urinalysis, and liver enzyme tests. The primary end-point is the time-course and depth
      of the frequency reduction of migraine attacks. The secondary end-points will be the
      absence/presence of detectable adverse liver function and urinalysis test results as well as
      the dearth/abundance of AE/SAE reports that may indicate patient safety/risk when using the
      IP.
