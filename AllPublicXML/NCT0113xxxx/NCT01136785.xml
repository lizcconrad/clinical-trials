  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed protocol is to rigorously test the hypothesis that CPAP
      treatment has beneficial effects on glycemic control in patients with both type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If our hypothesis were to be proven, this would
      imply that CPAP treatment of OSA in patients with T2DM is an essential component of their
      glycemic control. The proposed work is thus expected to provide additional preventive and
      therapeutic approaches in the management of millions of patients with T2DM.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of 7-day Intervention in Mean Plasma Glucose Derived From 24 Hour Blood Sampling</measure>
    <time_frame>after 1 week of CPAP therapy in the laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>24 hour blood sampling will be performed at baseline and at the end of the 7-day intervention. Glucose levels will be measured on each sample. Mean glucose level for all baseline samples will be calculated for each participant. Mean glucose levels for all samples collected at the end of the intervention will be calculated. Change in mean glucose level from baseline to end of intervention will be calculated for each participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Glucose From Continuous Interstitial Glucose Monitoring Over 36-40 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>change in mean interstitial glucose after 1 week of active or sham CPAP therapy in the laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous Glucose monitoring will provide interstitial glucose levels for 36-40 hours at baseline and after one week of active or sham CPAP therapy. The mean glucose level of all samples collected at baseline will be calculated for each participant. The mean glucose level of all samples collected at the end of the 7-day intervention will be calculated for each participant. For each participant, we will calculate the change in mean glucose level from baseline till end of the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Serum Insulin Derived From 24 Hour Blood Sampling</measure>
    <time_frame>after 1 week of therapy in the laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>Serum insulin levels will be measured on each sample collected during 24-h sampling at baseline and at the end of the 7-day intervention. Mean insulin level over 24 hours will be calculated for each participant at baseline and at the end of the intervention. For each participant, we will calculate the change in mean insulin level from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Plasma Cortisol Level From 24-h Sampling</measure>
    <time_frame>after 1 week of active CPAP therapy in the laboratory</time_frame>
    <description>The mean plasma cortisol level will be calculated for all samples collected at baseline and for all samples collected at the end of the intervention in participants randomized to the active CPAP arm. The goal of the analysis of cortisol, growth hormone and norepinephrine levels was to explore putative mechanisms underlying the effects of active CPAP therapy. Examining putative hormonal mechanisms underlying changes in glucose levels in the sham CPAP arm was not part of our aims. For each participant, the change in mean cortisol level from baseline to end of intervention will be calculated.</description>

The goal of the analysis of cortisol, growth hormone and norepinephrine levels was to explore putative mechanisms underlying the effects of active CPAP therapy. Examining putative hormonal mechanisms underlying changes in glucose levels in the sham CPAP arm was not part of our aims.

            <description>The goal of the present analysis is to explore mechanisms by which CPAP therapy led to improvement in the 24-h glucose levels. We focus on the 8 participants who had complete 24-h profiles of plasma norepinephrine before and after treatment with active CPAP.</description>

          <title>Change in 24-h Mean Level of Plasma Norepinephrine</title>
          <description>The mean plasma norepinephrine level will be calculated for all samples collected at baseline and for all samples collected at the end of the intervention in participants randomized to the active CPAP arm. The goal of the analysis of cortisol, growth hormone and norepinephrine levels was to explore putative mechanisms underlying the effects of active CPAP therapy. Examining putative hormonal mechanisms underlying changes in glucose levels in the sham CPAP arm was not part of our aims. For each participant, the change in mean norepinephine level from baseline to end of intervention will be calculated.</description>
