  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VueTek has developed a head mounted device that will improve the viewing of superficial,
      subcutaneous vasculature, differentiating it with higher contrast from surrounding tissue.
      Video of the vasculature is displayed to the user in a portable headset. The headset and
      display combination facilitates both visualization in the display and an open field of view
      directly to the subject's anatomy and practitioner's surroundings. The goal is to provide a
      non-diagnostic, enhanced visual aide that is used alongside standard visual and tactile
      methodology. The primary and secondary objectives of this validation are as follows:

        1. Primary Objective:

           To demonstrate that the VTS1000 affords visualization of superficial, subcutaneous
           vascular structures, when compared to the naked eye.

        2. Secondary Objective:

      To demonstrate that the VTS1000 enhances visualization of superficial, subcutaneous vascular
      structures over the naked eye.

      Validation Ancillary Endpoints

      1. To gather data to demonstrate that the VTS1000 is portable, affords conventional vascular
      access methods, and provides flexibility, fit and balance during use.

      Validation methodology:

      Ten (10) or more independent qualified practitioners trained to operate the device in
      accordance with the Directions For Use (DFU), and after completing the Device Usability
      aspect of the study, will be asked to perform simulated procedures with and without the
      device as indicated in the DFU on one-hundred (100) or more subjects using the following
      subject population and sampling table. A minimum of one hundred (100) or more data collection
      observations will be recorded, tabulated and reported.

      Assumptions: The population and sampling sizes chosen for each subject category will meet the
      goal to attain sufficient diversity to satisfy representation that supports the efficacy of
      the device across the population samples. Any failures or results from the acceptance
      criteria may require an increase in the sampling size to ensure coverage representation of
      all subject demographics.
