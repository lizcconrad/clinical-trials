  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess whether type of footwear worn changes the balance, mobility and
      confidence of older inpatients and consequently may affect their falls risk whilst in
      hospital. The investigators hope to identify which footwear type is most beneficial to
      patients in the ward environment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Footwear is known to be one of many recognised significant risk factors for falls, presumably
      by affecting balance and gait pattern. However, little is known regarding the best footwear
      for hospital inpatients in whom approximately 40% of older persons fall during their hospital
      admission. Patients admitted to hospital without their own footwear (slippers or shoes) are
      routinely given foam slippers referred to as pillow paws (PPs). There are concerns that these
      PPs may contribute to falls as they are often ill fitting (come in a very limited size range)
      and or are flimsy offering little foot and ankle support. Hence Medicine for the Elderly
      consultant and registrars designed this study to gain information on differences in balance,
      mobility and confidence when patients are wearing different footwear types. As a secondary
      outcome, falls data will also be collected to see whether there is any association between
      footwear types and inpatient falls incidence.

      The aim is to compare pillow paws (PPs) with sturdy outdoor footwear or sturdy slippers. In
      this way we hope to gain information on which footwear type is most beneficial to hospital
      inpatients. A recent similar study infers that sturdy outdoor footwear benefits outpatients,
      but it is not clear whether the same applies to a hospital inpatient population whom are
      often frailer with greater co-morbidities (physical and mental) and a higher falls risk.

    <measure>Functional Reach (centimeters)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (at time of single assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional reach (FR):This is a measure of balance routinely performed on rehabilitation wards.
The patient stands against a wall with one shoulder touching the wall and that arm fully extended horizontally. A mark is made on the wall recording the furthest point they are reaching to. They are then asked to stretch this arm as far forwards as they can without overbalancing/ stepping forwards. Another mark is made recording this maximum stretching distance. The difference between the 2 marks (in cm) is FR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Get-Up-And-Go (seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (at time of single assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Get-Up-And-Go (TUG):- This is a measure of mobility that is recommended in guidelines for General Practitioners and hospital clinicians to perform as part of a simple falls risk assessment. The patient is timed on how long (IN SECONDS)it takes them to rise from a standard arm chair, walk to a line on the floor approx 10 feet away from chair, turn and return to the chair and sit back down.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The 4-point bedside balance score (0-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (at time of single assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-point bedside balance score:- This also assesses participants' balance. The patient's ability to stand with feet together, then with one foot slightly in front of the other (ie. standing partially heel to toe), followed by standing with one foot directly in front of the other (ie. standing fully heel to toe) and then standing on one leg is recorded. Increasing points are scored for each movement completed successfully. If it is clear that a patient cannot complete a particular movement, then the next level up in difficulty is not attempted.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Falls Efficiency Scale - International Questionnaire (score 7-28 points)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (at time of single assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Short Falls Efficiency Scale - International (Short FES-I questionnaire) The patient will then be asked questions from the Short FES-I questionnaire. This asks the patient how concerned they would be about falling in the two footwear types in seven different situations. This is important to assess the influence footwear has on confidence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of falls during inpatient hospital stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Variable - duration of hospital admission</time_frame>
    <description>Any falls occurring during the participant's hospital stay will be recorded along with information on footwear worn at time of fall. This information can be accessed through NHS DATIX computerised incident reporting system.</description>
