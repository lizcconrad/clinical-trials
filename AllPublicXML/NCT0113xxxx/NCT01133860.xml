  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term MYH9-related disease (MYH9RD) includes four genetic disorders: May-Hegglin anomaly,
      Sebastian syndrome, Fechtner syndrome, and Epstein syndrome. All these disorders derive from
      mutation of a unique gene, named MYH9, and they have been recognized as different clinical
      presentations of a single illness that was named MYH9RD. All patients affected by MYH9RD
      present since birth with thrombocytopenia, which can result in a variable degree of bleeding
      diathesis; some of them subsequently develop additional clinical manifestations, such as
      renal damage, sensorineural hearing loss, and/or presenile cataracts. Eltrombopag is an oral
      thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of
      megakaryocytes, the bone marrow cells that produce blood platelets. This drug is effective in
      increasing platelet count in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients affected by some
      acquired thrombocytopenias, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and HCV related
      thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study is to determine if eltrombopag, administered
      orally at the dose of 50 or 75 mg/daily for up to 6 weeks, is effective in increasing
      platelet count of patients affected by MYH9RD. Further aims of this study are to test if
      eltrombopag is effective in reducing bleeding tendency of MYH9RD patients; to evaluate safety
      and tolerability of eltrombopag in patients with MYH9RD; to evaluate in vitro function of
      platelets produced during therapy in patients responding to this drug.

    <description>The primary endpoints were the achievement of a platelet count over 100 x10e9/L or at least 3 times the baseline value (major response), or at least twice the baseline value but less than major response (minor response). The overall response to therapy is reported. Platelet count was measured at the end of therapy (21 or 42 days, see study design) by phase-contrast microscopy.</description>

          -  Age 16 years or more

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MYH9-related disease

          -  Average platelet count for the previous year less than 50x10e9/L

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diseases known to involve the risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation)

          -  History of thrombosis within 1 year

          -  Use of drugs that affect platelet function (including but not limited to, aspirin,
             clopidogrel or NSAIDS) or anti-coagulants

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing (a negative pregnancy test in required before
             enrollment of fertile women)

          -  Formal refusal of any recommendation of a safe contraception

          -  Alcohol or drug addiction

          -  Altered renal function as defined by creatinine of 20 mg/L or more

          -  Any other disease or condition that by the advise of the responsible physician would
             make the treatment dangerous for the patient or would make the patient ineligible for
             the study, including physical, psychiatric, social and behavioral problems. HCV
             positivity and liver diseases will not be considered an exclusion criterion since a
             phase II study showed that eltrombopag was effective and safe in this patient
             population.

            <description>In patients with more than 100 x10e9 platelets/L at the end of therapy, we evaluated also the in vitro platelet aggregation after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (5 and 20 mcM), collagen (5 and 20 mg/mL) and ristocetin (3 mg/mL) by the densitometric method of Born in native platelet rich plasma. The extent of platelet aggregation was measured 5 minutes after the addition of stimulating agents and results obtained in patients were compared with the normal ranges in the laboratories where the assay was performed. Results are reported as the number of patients with normal platelet aggregation.</description>
