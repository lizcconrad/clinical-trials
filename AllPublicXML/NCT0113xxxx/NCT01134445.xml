      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of the DePuy PROXIMA™ hip in the
      treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who
      enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient,
      clinical and x-ray assessments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects between 18 and 70 years of age.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
             investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and agree to return to
             the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

          -  Subjects who are scheduled to undergo a primary THR whom the surgeon considers to be
             suitable for the DePuy PROXIMATM hip femoral prosthesis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with active local or systemic infection

          -  Subjects with loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in
             the affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified.

          -  Subjects with poor bone quality, such as osteoporosis, where, in the surgeon's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the prosthesis or a significant
             chance of fracture of the femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone to support
             the implant(s).

          -  Subjects with Charcot's or Paget's disease.

          -  Subjects with hip dysplasia with severe neck anteversion or severe dysplasia of the
             proximal femur.

          -  Subjects with severe osteoporosis.

          -  Subjects with previous proximal femoral fractures.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing
             condition/co-morbidity or infection that would compromise their long-term
             participation and follow-up in this study.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 6 month(s).

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

          -  Subjects for whom the surgical procedure is a revision of a previous THR,
             hemi-arthroplasty or hip resurfacing

          -  Subjects who have previously undergone osteotomy or arthrodesis of the hip.

          -  Subjects undergoing a simultaneous bilateral hip operation.

          -  Subjects undergoing the second stage of a staged bilateral for whom the contralateral
             hip is part of this clinical investigation.

          -  Subjects undergoing the second stage of a staged bilateral for whom the contralateral
             hip was implanted less than six months previously or is not performing satisfactorily
