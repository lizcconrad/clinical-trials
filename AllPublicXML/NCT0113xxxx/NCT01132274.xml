  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is the mainstay of therapy for supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmias, providing cure in a high percentage of cases. Conventional ablation
      techniques require the use of fluoroscopy to place and navigate catheters in the heart, thus
      exposing patients to ionizing radiations with an additional risk of cancer. The feasibility
      and safety of a non-fluoroscopic RFCA of a wide range of supraventricular arrhythmias using
      the EnSite NavX mapping system have been recently reported. The NO-PARTY is a multicenter,
      randomized-controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that supraventricular arrhythmias
      RFCA through the non-fluoroscopic EnSite NavX mapping system results in a clinically
      significant reduction of the exposure to ionizing radiations compared with conventional
      ablation techniques.

      NO-PARTY trial will determine whether supraventricular tachyarrhythmia RFCA through a
      non-fluoroscopic EnSite NavX mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to
      achieve a clinically significant reduction of ionizing radiation exposure for both the
      patient and the operator.
