      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that different CYD Dengue vaccine lots
      manufactured using the same method and in the same location but at different times produce an
      equivalent immunological response.

      Primary Objective

        -  To demonstrate that three different Phase III lots of CYD Dengue vaccine induce an
           equivalent immune response in terms of post-Dose 3 geometric mean titers (GMTs) against
           the four parental serotypes.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that data from one Phase II lot and pooled data from Phase III lots of
           CYD Dengue vaccine show an equivalent immune response in terms of post-Dose 3 GMTs
           against the four parental serotypes.

        -  To describe the safety (in terms of solicited injection site and systemic reactions and
           unsolicited adverse events) of the CYD Dengue vaccine in all subjects after each dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive 3 doses of their assigned vaccine or placebo and will provide blood
      samples at defined timepoints for flavivirus status and immunogenicity assessment.
      Reactogenicity data will be collected in all subjects after each dose and throughout the
      study.
