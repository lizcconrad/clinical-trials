    <textblock>
      A single-dose, two-way, bioequivalence study in up to 26 normal, non-smoking, healthy males
      and females will be utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of
      Lamotrigine chewable dispersible formulations under fasted conditions.

          -  Received an investigational drug within the 4 weeks prior to study dosing.

          -  Currently taking any prescription medication, except oral contraceptives, within the 7

             and for one week after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of
             contraception that may be used by the subject and/or her partner are: oral
             contraceptives, progestin injection or implants, condom with spermicide, diaphragm
             with spermicide, IUD, vaginal spermicidal suppository, surgical sterilization of their
             partner(s) or abstinence. Females taking oral contraceptives must have taken them
