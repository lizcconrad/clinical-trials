  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the validity of a multi-gene Lung Cancer Risk Test
      (LCRT). In the process, the investigators will establish a bank of NBEC samples and
      corresponding blood samples from individuals demographically at increased risk for lung
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      Because more than 160,000 individuals die of lung cancer/year in the United States alone, it
      is important to use the best possible methods to determine whether increased surveillance of
      individuals at highest risk for lung cancer will result in reduced lung cancer mortality. The
      Lung Cancer Risk Test (LCRT) proposed for evaluation promises to accurately identify the
      10-15% of the population that is most susceptible to lung cancer based on genetic
      predisposition. More than 90 million individuals in the United States alone are
      demographically at high risk for lung cancer and potential candidates for increased
      surveillance.

      Normal bronchial epithelial cell (NBEC) RNA. NBEC samples were obtained by bronchoscopic
      brushing after informed consent to this project was obtained. RNA was extracted and frozen in
      aliquots then archived. Two aliquots, were prepared for most subjects. In most cases, there
      were more than 1 microgram of RNA per aliquot.

        The study population will consist of subjects aged 50 to 90 and with 20 or more pack year
        smoking history, who are determined not to have lung cancer at the time of enrollment or
        within three months after the date of enrollment, and either a) volunteer for the study
        driven bronchoscopy, or b) have standard of care clinical need for diagnostic bronchoscopy
        (e.g. they may present with respiratory symptoms or abnormal test results consistent with
        the need for bronchoscopy).
