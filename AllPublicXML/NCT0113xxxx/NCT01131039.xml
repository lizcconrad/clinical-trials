      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the administration of bevacizumab and
      gemcitabine given by IV infusion can prolong survival, delay tumor growth, and/or shrink
      tumors in patients with ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

             cancer

          4. Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension (longest dimension recorded). Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm when
             measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT and MRI, or
             &gt; 10 mm when measured by spiral CT. OR Clinically or radiologically detectable disease
             (ascites, peritoneal deposits, mesenteric thickening or lesions that do not fulfill
             RECIST for measurable disease). In addition, the subject must have two consecutive
             rising pretreatment CA-125 levels that are both &gt; 2x the institutional upper limit of
             normal (ULN) and 40.0 IU/ml taken at least 1 week and nor more than 3 months apart.

          5. Platinum-resistant or refractory cancer; subjects must not have had a biologic or
             chemotherapeutic regimen for treatment of platinum-resistant disease prior to study

             recurrence within 6 months after completing or while receiving a platinum-containing
             regimen. These subjects must not have had any other non-platinum-containing regimen.
             OR Subjects with secondary platinum-resistant cancer may have had any regimen with any
             response and then have had tumor recurrence within 6 months after completing or while
             receiving retreatment with a platinum-containing regimen. These subjects must have
             received only two prior chemotherapeutic regimens. OR Subjects who receive a
             chemotherapeutic regimen as consolidation after a response to a platinum-containing
             regimen must have had tumor recurrence within 6 months after completing or while
             receiving the consolidation regimen.
