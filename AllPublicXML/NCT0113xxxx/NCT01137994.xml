  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with
      chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive and p95HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
      Eligible subjects will have newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) either as a
      primary diagnosis or as a recurrence following treatment of curative intent; not have
      received systemic or local treatment for MBC and have breast cancer that is positive for HER2
      and p95HER2. The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of lapatinib
      plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in subjects
      with MBC exhibiting concurrent HER2 overexpression (and/or gene amplification) and expression
      of carboxy-terminal fragments of HER2 (p95HER2). The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit response rate and the safety as
      well as tolerability of lapatinib plus chemotherapy and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.
