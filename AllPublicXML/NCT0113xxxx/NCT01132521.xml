      This study aims to evaluate the effect of ulinastatin in the treatment and prevention of
      organ failure in severe acute pancreatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis have a severe course, and 10-15% of those with
      severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) die. Despite improvements in intensive care treatment during
      past few decades, effective therapies for acute pancreatitis are still limited.

      Early deaths (within the first week) due to severe acute pancreatitis are generally caused by
      massive inflammatory responses which result in multiple organ failure. Although the exact
      mechanisms which trigger the inflammatory processes are not completely understood, it is
      generally accepted that autodigestion and activated leukocytes play important roles in the
      pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Activation of digestive enzymes causes pancreatic injury
      and results in an inflammatory response that is out of proportion to the response of other
      organs to a similar insult. The acute inflammatory response itself causes substantial tissue
      damage and may progress beyond the pancreas to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
      multi organ failure, or death.

      UTI is a multivalent Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that is found in human urine and
      blood, it can stabilize lysosome membrane and inhibit lysosome function, inhibit the various
      enzymes and inflammatory response. Previous study proved that it protects against SIRS
      pathophysiology and subsequent organ damage induced via the modulation of the proinflammatory
      mediator, as well as chemokines. UTI has been widely used for the treatment and prevention of
      multiple organ failure in China, but there is few randomized, placebo controlled trial on
      ulinastatin. A large multicenter, randomized study is warranted. In this study, we aim to
      evaluate the effect of ulinastatin in the treatment and prevention of organ failure in severe
      acute pancreatitis with regular treatment in an add-on trial.
