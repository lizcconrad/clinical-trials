          -  Medically healthy with normal screening results, or in the case of results that are
             abnormal; the abnormal results are clinically insignificant (eg, medical history,
             physical examination, neurological assessment, vital signs, oxygen saturation,
             laboratory profiles)

          -  12-lead ECGs (calculations by the electrocardiograph) which have no clinically
             significant findings

          -  Vital signs which are within normal range

          -  No tobacco/nicotine-containing product use for a minimum of 6 months

          -  If female, must be able to adhere to acceptable methods of contraception or be
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurological disease

          -  History or presence of any degree of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  History of suicidal ideations or depression requiring professional intervention
             including counseling or antidepressant medication

          -  Any history of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Positive drug (urine)/alcohol (breath) testing at screening or check-in

          -  Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV)

             naloxone, naltrexone, palonosetron (Aloxi®), glycerin, senna, or bisacodyl (Dulcolax®)

          -  Use of any prescription medication (with the exception of hormonal contraceptives for
             females) within 2 weeks of enrollment

          -  Use of any over-the-counter medication, including herbal products, within 1 week of
             enrollment

          -  Use of any drugs known to significantly inhibit or induce liver enzymes involved in
             drug metabolism [CYP P450]) within 30 days of enrollment

          -  Blood donation or significant blood loss within 30 days of enrollment

          -  Plasma donation within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days of enrollment

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Any other condition or prior therapy, which, in the opinion of the PI, would make the
             subject unsuitable for this study
