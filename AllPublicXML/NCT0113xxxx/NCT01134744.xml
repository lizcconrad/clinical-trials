    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the clinical criteria for requesting a chest x-ray
      in a patient with blunt trauma and its findings such as clinical signs with a high
      sensitivity could be used in a larger study to codify the final criteria.

      At present, a Chest x-ray is obtained from all trauma patients having suspicion to chest
      trauma. The indications for such radiographs are not well defined. This results in a large
      number of unnecessary chest radiographs being obtained. Our goal was to identify the clinical
      criteria for requesting a chest x-ray in a patient with blunt trauma and its findings such as
      clinical signs with a high sensitivity could be used in a larger study to codify the final
      criteria.
