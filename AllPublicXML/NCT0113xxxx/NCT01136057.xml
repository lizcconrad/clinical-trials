      Treatment options are limited for the treatment of influenza. This study will collect blood
      from people who have been exposed to the influenza virus or who have received a seasonal
      influenza vaccine. The blood plasma will be used in a future clinical trial to treat people
      hospitalized with influenza.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a concern that the influenza virus will become resistant to the standard of care,
      oseltamivir (commonly known as Tamiflu), as resistance to this medication has been observed
      in people infected with the seasonal influenza virus. Because of the possibility of drug
      resistance, additional treatment options for influenza are needed. The purpose of this study
      is to collect blood from people who have recovered from influenza or who have received a
      seasonal influenza vaccine. The blood will then be processed into Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-licensed fresh frozen plasma (FFP). In a future clinical trial, this
      plasma will be used as a treatment for people hospitalized with influenza.

      This study will enroll people who have recovered from influenza or received a seasonal
      influenza vaccine. Participants will donate blood at FDA-licensed blood donor centers up to
      three times during the 240-day study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently healthy males 18 - 59 years of age with a history suggestive of having
             anti-influenza antibodies (either or both of the following):

               1. An influenza-like illness (e.g., fever, chills, malaise, cough, myalgias,
                  nausea). Subjects must asymptomatic and must be afebrile for â‰¥ 7 days, and must
                  enroll within 12 months of onset of illness.

               2. Vaccinated with a licensed influenza vaccine. Enrollment must occur &gt;14 days and
                  &lt; 12 months from date of vaccination.

          -  Must be an adult male Department of Defense (DoD)/beneficiary

          -  Sign informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
             document

          -  A demonstrated H1N1 HAI titer of 1:160 or greater and H3N2 HAI titer of 1:40 or
             greater.

          -  Must also meet all Standard-of-Care inclusion criteria for donation of blood or plasma
             at the FDA-licensed donor center prior to every donation session. More information on
             this criterion can be found in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Donors that do not meet all Standard-of-Care FDA approved requirements for the
             donation of blood and production of FFP as determined by the FDA-licensed donor center
             prior to every donation session may be excluded from further participation in this
             study. Study exclusion will be determined by the principal investigator (PI) or lead
             investigator at the study site.

             the following blood borne pathogens at the donor center will be excluded:

               1. Anti-HIV-I/II
