    <textblock>
      Patients with implanted cardiac devices who meet appropriate entrance criteria undergo
      clinically indicated Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging Studies using an established safety
      protocol.

    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study to use an established MRI device safety protocol to decrease
      the risk of clinically indicated MR imaging in patients with implantable cardiac devices. All
      devices will undergo a complete interrogation and testing of thresholds, sensing, battery
      voltage and impedances prior to and following imaging. Pre-MRI, devices will be programmed to
      setting that will ensure MRI safety. During imaging, patients will blood pressure, heart rate
      and O2 sat level will be monitored continuously.
