  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to find out whether conservative treatment - expectant management or
      medical therapy using misoprostol is beneficial in the case of uterine residua, and which
      treatment is better.

      Retained products of conception are estimated to occur after approximately 1-6% of
      pregnancies, probably more often after termination of early pregnancies then after term
      pregnancy. Complication are abdominal pain, infection, bleeding and for the long term -
      intrauterine adhesions.Blood clots in the uterine cavity can cause similar complications. The
      definitive treatment is curettage or hysteroscopy, both of which are carried out under
      general anesthesia and require an operating theater. Although expectant management and
      uterotonic drugs are practically used in such situation, they are not described in the
      literature.This study compare between the outcome of misoprostol treatment and expectant
      management in the case of intrauterine residua after completion of pregnancy.
