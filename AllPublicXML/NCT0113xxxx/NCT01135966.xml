  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been emerged as a recommended standard of care for patients with
      chronic lung disease based on a growing body of scientific evidence. A set of evidence-based
      guidelines were published in American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American
      Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR). Since then, the
      published literature in pulmonary rehabilitation has increased substantially, and other
      societies have published important statements about pulmonary rehabilitation (eg, the
      American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society).

      In patients with COPD, there is a strong scientific basis for implementing conventional
      resistance training (CRT) in addition to endurance training. Endurance training, such as
      walking, is a key component of pulmonary rehabilitation and improves in exercise tolerance
      and muscular endurance. However, this type of training may not reverse muscle weakness or
      atrophy. For that reason, strength training seems to be the optimum training modality to
      increase muscle mass and strength.

      Recently, Whole-Body-Vibration (WBV) training has been promoted as an alternative for
      resistance training on multigym equipment. In WBV training, the subject stands on a platform
      that generates vertical sinusoidal vibration, during which static and dynamic exercises can
      be performed.

      The present study is conducted to provide an answer on the following question: will a
      resistance training program, such as the whole body vibration, be even effective than a
      conventional resistance training program in patients with COPD.
