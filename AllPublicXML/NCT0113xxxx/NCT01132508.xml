  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, non-randomized prospective case series of tibial plateau
      fractures using Norian Drillable to fill bone voids, to evaluate OR time, blood loss,
      complications, ease of use, fracture stabilization and patient function and pain over time.

        <description>The anatomical grading parameter &quot;depression&quot; was assessed the following way: Anterior-Posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were taken for the fractured and healthy tibia plateau at Baseline, right after surgery and all follow-up timepoint. Additional oblique radiographs at 45° or other fracture imaging was optional. All post-operative radiographs were compared against the healthy tibia films post-surgery and all follow-up radiographs were compared with the post-operative radiographs to evaluate the quality and changes in reduction at each timepoint. CT scans were only mandatory at Baseline.</description>

          <description>The anatomical grading parameter &quot;depression&quot; was assessed the following way: AP and lateral radiographs were taken for the fractured and healthy tibia plateau at Baseline, right after surgery and all follow-up timepoint. Additional oblique radiographs at 45° or other fracture imaging was optional. All post-operative radiographs were compared against the healthy tibia films post-surgery and all follow-up radiographs were compared with the post-operative radiographs to evaluate the quality and changes in reduction at each timepoint.

        <description>The anatomical grading parameter &quot;condylar widening&quot; (enlargement of the knee joint) was assessed the following way: AP and lateral radiographs were taken for the fractured and healthy tibia plateau at Baseline, right after surgery and all follow-up timepoints. Additional oblique radiographs at 45° or other fracture imaging was optional. All post-operative radiographs were compared against the healthy tibia films post-surgery and all follow-up radiographs were compared with the post-operative radiographs to evaluate the quality and changes in reduction at each timepoint. CT scans were only mandatory at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The anatomical grading parameter &quot;angulation (valgus/varus)&quot; (abnormal outward/inward turning of the knee) was assessed the following way: AP and lateral radiographs were taken for the fractured and healthy tibia plateau at Baseline, right after surgery and all follow-up timepoints. Additional oblique radiographs at 45° or other fracture imaging was optional. All post-operative radiographs were compared against the healthy tibia films post-surgery and all follow-up radiographs were compared with the post-operative radiographs to evaluate the quality and changes in reduction at each timepoint. CT scans were only mandatory at Baseline.</description>
