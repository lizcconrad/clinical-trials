  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapleural thrombolytic treatment with urokinase for retained hemothorax is effective and
      safe. However, previous study was limited in prospective observation study without control
      group.

      We will recruit 32 patients in this study. The patients with retained hemothorax will be
      randomly divided into the urokinase group and the placebo group. In the urokinase group,
      urokinase 100,000 IU in 100 mL NaCl will be injected into the intrapleural space. We will
      record the daily drainage amount and evaluate the therapeutic effect by the chest X-ray. The
      therapeutic effect, safety, hospital stay, and medical cost between the two groups will be
      compared. This study will be done in four medical centers in northern Taiwan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Retained hemothorax: it is defined as chest X-ray revealing obvious blood clot in
             pleural cavity after tube thoracostomy drainage for 3 days. The chest tubes are in
             good location and have no obstruction. The physician thinks the blood clot is
             difficult to drain.

          2. Age: full 18 year-old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Active bleeding

          3. Coagulopathy, e.g. congenital or acquired coagulation abnormality, platelet count less
             than 100,000 /Î¼L, international normalized ratio (INR) more than 1.5, or partial
             thromboplastin time, PTT, more than 50 seconds after treatment.

          4. Cerebrovascular accident within 30 days

          5. History of intracranial tumor or vascular abnormality

          6. Have received thoracic surgery

          7. Have received pleurodesis

          8. Wish to receive thoracoscopic surgery for hematoma evacuation directly

          9. Allergy to urokinase

         10. Sepsis

         11. Shock

         12. People who are less than 18 years of age, prisoners, aborigines.
