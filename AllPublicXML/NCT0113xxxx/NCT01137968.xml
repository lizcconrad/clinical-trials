      The purpose of this is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of imetelstat (GRN163L) as
      maintenance therapy for patients with advanced stage NSCLC who have not progressed after 4
      cycles of platinum based therapy.

      Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to imetelstat + standard of care versus
      standard of care alone. Participants who received bevacizumab with their induction
      chemotherapy will continue to receive bevacizumab on this study.

             first line, advanced NSCLC, with no evidence of disease progression according to

             placement is allowed)

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease. Patients with stable CNS
             disease following completion of radiation therapy and/or surgery are eligible.

          -  Any other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, laboratory
             abnormality, or difficulty complying with protocol requirements that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for the study.
