  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perianal topical nitroglycerin has been widely used as a means for avoiding surgery in
      patients with anal fissure. However, nitroglycerin has not been universally accepted for this
      application because of inconsistency of efficacy and side effects. Recent studies (Dis Colon
      Rectum. 2007 Apr;50(4):509-16) have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment products
      compounded by pharmacies did not meet the USP specifications for potency and/or content
      uniformity when filling a prescription for 0.3 percent nitroglycerin ointment. These results
      raise significant issues as to whether the patient is put at undue risk relative to the
      relief of their anal fissure pain. In addition, one study (Dis Colon Rectum. 2006
      Jun;49(6):865-8) has demonstrated that intra-anal dosing of topical nitroglycerin produces a
      significantly greater reduction in sphincteric pressure and lower incidence of headaches than
      with perianal administration of the same dose of ointment.

      Topical glyceryl trinitrate 0.4% ointment has been developed and tested in clinical trials
      and is effective in healing chronic anal fissures. It assures exactly dose and concentration
      of nitroglycerin.

      Hypothesis: The endoanal application of exactly dose and concentration of nitroglycerin must
      reduced headache and the final recurrence.

      The purpose of this study is:

      1. Principal end-point: to compare perianal vs endoanal application of Rectogesic and
      evaluate the different morbidity of the two presentation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Before a definitive definition of chronic anal fissure and ensuring inclusion in the
             study, all patients diagnosed as having chronic anal fissure based on their medical
             history and physical exploration were treated for a minimum of six weeks with
             conservative medical treatment (high residue diet, analgesics, and warm sitz baths).
             Chronic anal fissure was defined by the presence of a fibrous induration or exposed
             internal sphincter fibres.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Associated anal pathologies (incontinence, stenosis, abscess, fistula and
             haemorrhoids)

          -  Patients with associated conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, acquired
             immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted disease and
             immunosuppression)

          -  Cardiopathy

          -  Headache and pregnancy.
