      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of
      ESD(Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection) for early gastric cancer analyzing short-term and
      long-term results of endoscopic treatment.

      Traditionally open-gastrectomy is the standard treatment for gastric cancer without distant
      metastasis, but high mortality and morbidity, the intense weight loss, food intake
      difficulties after surgery are fraught, including problems with the drawback of significantly
      degrading the quality of life. Therefore, a lot of effort to seek the more simple treatment
      than open gastrectomy has been made, recently the endoscopic treatment for early gastric
      cancer is the most widely used treatment.

      This single-arm, multi-center study enroll early gastric cancer patients after ESD compared
      with the retrospective control(surgical treatment) group considering the unreality of the
      randomized clinical trials. In addition, the quality of life assessment by the EORTC
      C30/STO22 tools before and after ESD procedure in enrolled patients will be performed and the
      direct cost analysis also will be conducted.
