    <measure>Total Number of Participants Who Completed the Study-Related Ultrasound (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) With and Without Contrast</measure>
    <time_frame>Either Day 40±20 days following the placement of CVC (cohort A) or within 7 days of: symptoms of DVT or incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT(cohort B) or Day of MRI + 48 hours (cohort C).</time_frame>
    <description>One set of 3 diagnostic imaging procedures (US, MRI with contrast, and MRI without contrast) was performed for all cohorts. Imaging was performed on Visit 1, which in Cohort A was Day 40 ± 20 days from Day 0, the placement of the central venous catheter (CVC), or if possible within 72 hours after a CVC was removed or lost; Visit 1 in Cohort B was within 7 days of initiation of symptoms of a CVC-related deep vein thromboembolism (DVT) or within 7 days of an incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT by radiographic imaging. Cohort C participants had an ultrasound done within 48 hours of the performance of the MRI, which was scheduled for a clinical reason. Note: participants completing each MRI procedure (with contrast or without contrast) could be different participants.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Completed the Study-Related Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) With and Without Contrast, by Cohort and Age Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Either Day 40±20 days following the placement of CVC (cohort A) or within 7 days of: symptoms of DVT or incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT(cohort B) or Day of MRI + 48 hours (cohort C)</time_frame>
    <description>Imaging was performed on Visit 1 which was defined for Cohort A as: Day 40 ± 20 days from Day 0, the placement of the central venous catheter (CVC), or if possible within 72 hours after a CVC was removed or lost; Visit 1 defined for Cohort B: within 7 days of initiation of symptoms of a CVC-related deep vein thromboembolism (DVT) or within 7 days of an incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT by radiographic imaging. Cohort C participants had an ultrasound done within 48 hours of the performance of the MRI. All 3 imaging procedures, ultrasound, MRI with contrast, MRI without contrast were to be performed on all participants, regardless of the cohort.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Required Sedation/Anesthesia With the Study-Related Radiographic Procedures, by Cohort and Age</measure>
    <time_frame>Either Day 40±20 days following the placement of CVC (cohort A) or within 7 days of: symptoms of DVT or incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT(cohort B) or Day of MRI + 48 hours (cohort C).</time_frame>
    <description>One set of diagnostic imaging procedures (US and MRI) was to be performed for all cohorts The MRI consisted of MRI venous imaging without contrast enhancement and MRI venous imaging with contrast enhancement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants and Reasons for Non-Completion of Each of the Imaging Procedures, Ultrasound (US), MRI With Contrast and MRI Without Contrast</measure>
    <time_frame>Either Day 40±20 days following the placement of CVC (cohort A) or within 7 days of: symptoms of DVT or incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT(cohort B) or Day of MRI + 48 hours (cohort C).</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral US was attempted but if it could not be completed, a unilateral US was accepted for analysis. Participants who did not complete the MRI procedure with contrast could be different participants from those who did not complete the MRI procedure without contrast. Primary reasons for non-completion of imaging included: technical, investigator decision, child refused, parent refused, child missed appointment, difficulties with anesthesia/sedation, child unable to lie still, problems with contrast administration, and other reasons. Other reasons could include: late to appointment and unable to perform MRI due to time constraints; logistical reasons, parent agreed to only ultrasound at time of consent, schedule delay, equipment not available, difficulty putting patient in correct position. Due to the small numbers of participants in some cohorts, these data were more meaningful with all cohorts grouped together for the total imaged population.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adjudicated Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Detected By a Study-Related Ultrasound (US) and/or MRI, By Cohort and Age Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Either Day 40±20 days following the placement of CVC (cohort A) or within 7 days of: symptoms of DVT or incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT(cohort B) or Day of MRI + 48 hours (cohort C)</time_frame>
    <description>MRI with contrast (c) and without (w/o) contrast (c) enhancement were performed and a US was done within 48 hours of the MRI. Once detected, the DVT was adjudicated and confirmed by an independent central adjudication Committee (ICAC) consisting of experienced physicians not involved in the study and blinded to each participant's identity and clinical course. Participants were considered positive for DVT if at least one of the radiographic procedures was positive. Cohort A: Day 0=day of catheter placement; Day 40 (± 20 days)=day of imaging procedures at Visit 1, or if possible within 72 hours after a CVC is removed or lost. Cohort B Visit 1: within 7 days of initiation of symptoms of a CVC-related DVT (symptoms include but were not limited to: redness, pain/tenderness, swelling, presence of subcutaneous collaterals, catheter occlusion, and the presence of catheter related infection) or within 7 days of an incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT by radiographic imaging.</description>

    <description>Signs and symptoms of PE include shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, cough, orthopnea, wheezing, and may have associated signs and symptoms of DVT. In the event a PE was detected while undergoing the study MRI or other imaging procedure required for care of an underlying condition, and the participant did not manifest any signs and/or symptoms of a PE, the event was considered an asymptomatic PE. The participant was managed and further investigated according to the investigator's standard of care. All diagnostic imaging procedures performed, such as contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram, nuclear ventilation perfusion lung scan (V/Q scan), were submitted for adjudication as a suspected PE.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study initiated: 28 February 2011; Study Completed: 10 May 2013. Patients with central venous catheter (CVC) in-place or planned were enrolled. The Study was diagnostic for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and was non-therapeutic.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>151 participants enrolled; 134 had at least one study-related diagnostic imaging procedure completed or partially completed; 17 enrolled but not identified to a cohort and no study-related imaging procedures performed: Adverse event (2), withdrew consent (1), lost to follow up (1), poor/non-compliance (1), no longer met criteria (3), other (9).</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Cohort A</title>
          <description>Cohort A included pediatric participants (full-term newborns to &lt;18 years) in which a CVC was recently placed and who were asymptomatic for CVC-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Imaging procedures occurred on Day 40 ± 20 days relative to catheter placement (Day 0) and included: ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with and without contrast enhancement. The MRI and US were to be done within 48 hours of each other. An approved gadolinium contrast agent at a dose which was considered ‘state-of-the-art’ or standard institutional practice at the specific site and in accordance with the country-specific regulatory guidance was to be used for MRI with contrast. No sedation or anesthesia was to be allowed. Participants who developed symptoms of VTE prior to imaging should have been switched to Cohort B.</description>

          <title>Cohort B</title>
          <description>Cohort B included pediatric participants (full-term newborns to &lt;18 years) with a CVC and who were either symptomatic for a CVC-related DVT or had an incidental diagnosis of CVC-related DVT based on radiographic imaging performed for other clinical reasons. Diagnostic imaging procedures, US and MRI (with and without gadolinium contrast enhancement) were to be done within 48 hours of each other or, for those with therapeutic anticoagulation, within 24 hours. Aesthesia/sedation allowed as routine standard of care for participants only if symptomatic for a CVC-related DVT. For those participants symptomatic for a CVC-related DVT, MRI and US were to be initiated within 7 days of symptoms. In those participants with an incidental diagnosis of a CVC-related DVT made by radiographic imaging performed for clinical reasons, MRI and US were to be done within 7 days of the diagnosis of the CVC-related DVT.</description>

          <title>Sub-Study Cohort C</title>
          <description>A Sub-study with additional cohort C was initiated to collect diagnostic imaging procedures for the detection of CVC-related DVT in a population &lt; 18 years of age who had a CVC in place and who were scheduled to undergo a contrast enhanced MRI in any part of their body as part of their clinical care and who allowed the diagnostic imaging procedure to include the area around the CVC. Participants who developed symptoms of VTE prior to imaging should have been switched to Cohort B.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adjudicated Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Events (Symptomatic or Asymptomatic) Identified During the Study</title>
        <description>Signs and symptoms of PE include shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, cough, orthopnea, wheezing, and may have associated signs and symptoms of DVT. In the event a PE was detected while undergoing the study MRI or other imaging procedure required for care of an underlying condition, and the participant did not manifest any signs and/or symptoms of a PE, the event was considered an asymptomatic PE. The participant was managed and further investigated according to the investigator’s standard of care. All diagnostic imaging procedures performed, such as contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram, nuclear ventilation perfusion lung scan (V/Q scan), were submitted for adjudication as a suspected PE.</description>

Diagnostic imaging procedures: ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with and without contrast enhancement. The MRI and US were to be done within 48 hours of each other. An approved gadolinium contrast agent at a dose which was considered ‘state-of-the-art’ or standard institutional practice at the specific site and in accordance with the country-specific regulatory guidance was to be used. No sedation or anesthesia to be allowed. Participants enrolled in Cohort A and who developed symptoms of a venous thromboembolism (VTE), including a symptomatic DVT or a symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) prior to their MRI/US, were switched to Cohort B.</description>

        <description>Bilateral US was attempted but if it could not be completed, a unilateral US was accepted for analysis. Participants who did not complete the MRI procedure with contrast could be different participants from those who did not complete the MRI procedure without contrast. Primary reasons for non-completion of imaging included: technical, investigator decision, child refused, parent refused, child missed appointment, difficulties with anesthesia/sedation, child unable to lie still, problems with contrast administration, and other reasons. Other reasons could include: late to appointment and unable to perform MRI due to time constraints; logistical reasons, parent agreed to only ultrasound at time of consent, schedule delay, equipment not available, difficulty putting patient in correct position. Due to the small numbers of participants in some cohorts, these data were more meaningful with all cohorts grouped together for the total imaged population.</description>
