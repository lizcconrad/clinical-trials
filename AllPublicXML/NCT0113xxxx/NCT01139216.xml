  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-related effects of TU-100, a botanical agent
      that modulates gastrointestinal nerves, on rectal compliance, rectal sensation thresholds and
      small bowel and colonic transit in female patients with functional constipation as compared
      to placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet Rome III criteria for functional constipation

          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          3. Females, not pregnant or not breast-feeding

               -  Females of childbearing potential must use an acceptable form of contraception
                  during the study and for 30 days after the last dose. Acceptable methods include
                  surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives (such as oral contraceptives,
                  Depo-Provera, Nuva Ring, condoms used with a spermicide, an IUD or abstinence.

               -  Females are not considered to be of childbearing potential if they are
                  postmenopausal for at least two years or have been surgically sterilized.

          4. Ages 18 to 65 years old inclusive

          5. A body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m2 inclusive

          6. A negative urine drug screen at Visit 1

          7. Normal or not clinically significant laboratory results as reviewed by the study
             physicians

          8. A normal rectal exam result on file within the past 2 years or performed at Visit 1 in
             order to exclude the possibility of an evacuation disorder. Examination must exclude
             findings suggestive of an evacuation disorder such as high sphincter tone at rest,
             failure of perineal descent and spasm, tenderness or paradoxical contraction of the
             puborectalis muscles.

          9. Do not have sufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Structural or metabolic diseases/conditions that affect the gastrointestinal system or
             functional gastrointestinal disorders other than constipation.

          2. Taking any medication that in the opinion of the principal investigator has a
             potential to alter GI transit. This includes but is not limited to osmotic or
             stimulant laxatives, magnesium or aluminum-containing antacids, prokinetics,
             erythromycin, narcotics, anticholinergics, selective norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitors (SNRIs), opiates, GABAergic agents and benzodiazepines.

               -  Note: Tricyclic antidepressants are permissible at doses equal to or less than 25
                  mg daily; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are
                  permissible at low, stable doses. Analgesics such as Tylenol, ibuprofen, naproxen
                  and aspirin are permissible. All medications shall be reviewed by the principal
                  investigator on a case by case basis.

               -  Rescue medications: Rescue medications shall be reviewed and approved as
                  necessary for exacerbation of constipation as the study medication treatment
                  period is lengthy, about 28 days total. The patient will contact the study staff
                  to request review and approval of the use of a rescue medication by the principal
                  investigator. The use of the rescue medication will be documented by the patient
                  in the bowel pattern diary. Rescue medications are not allowed within 7 days of
                  the abbreviated baseline or the full transit scintigraphy to ensure data
                  integrity.

          3. Clinical evidence, including but not limited to a clinically significant abnormal
             physical exam or laboratory test result or a past event documented in the past medical
             record, or current clinically significant abnormal physical exam or laboratory test
             result that could indicate significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, psychiatric or other diseases that
             interfere with the objectives of the study. If a laboratory test result is abnormal
             and clinically significant, it may be repeated once at the discretion of the principal
             investigator. If the laboratory test result remains abnormal and clinically
             significant, the patient will be discontinued from the study and referred to a primary
             care physician for evaluation.

          4. Patients who are considered to be alcoholics not in remission or known substance
             abusers.

          5. Patients who have participated in another clinical study in the past 30 days.

          6. Patients who have a history of allergic reactions to egg, ginseng, ginger or Sichuan
             pepper

          7. Patients who are clinically lactose intolerant

          8. Patients must agree to avoid alcohol during the days of Visits 5, 6 and 7 to avoid
             corrupting the data from the anorectal manometry and rectal barostat tests.
