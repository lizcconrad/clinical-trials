  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans must be performed according to specified sets of
      parameters that provide optimal images of each organ and each area of the body. These
      scanning parameters are often specific to the institution or organization at which they are
      employed, and may also depend on the manufacturer of the MRI scanning equipment. Because MRI
      scanning equipment is always being updated and upgraded, researchers are interested in
      developing new and optimized scanning parameters for MRI scans.

      Objectives:

      - To improve current methods and develop new techniques for magnetic resonance imaging.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who are either volunteers or current NIH protocol
           participants.

        -  Participants must not have any medical history factors (e.g., extreme claustrophobia,
           history of metal implants) that would prevent them from receiving MRI scans.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have at least one MRI scan that will last from 20 minutes to 2 hours
           (most scans will last between 45 and 90 minutes). The total time commitment for most
           visits will be approximately 4 hours from start to finish.

        -  Some MRI techniques require standard monitoring equipment or specific procedures during
           the scanning, such as an electrocardiogram.

        -  Participants will have blood samples taken at the time of the scan. Some MRI studies
           will require the use of a contrast agent that will be administered during the scan.

        -  Volunteers may be asked to return for additional MRI scans over the course of a few
           years. Follow-up scans may be done on the same part of the body or on different parts of
           the body. No more than one MRI scan will be performed in any 4-week period for this
           protocol.

      Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging performed on volunteers will be used to develop and optimize
      techniques useful in the advancement of MRI technology. The results will be used to evaluate
      the performance of new imaging methods and equipment on human subjects, and to provide
      essential ground work for research and development for use in future patients. MR imaging is
      a non invasive technology, though some scans, dependent on imaging area and researcher
      preference, may be performed with MR contrast - gadolinium (Gd) - given intravenously.
