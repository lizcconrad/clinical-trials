      Background:

      - The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) is dedicated to understanding immune responses associated
      with prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. To study these immune responses,
      researchers need to collect specimens and images from individuals who have recently had a
      vaccination or recovered from an infection. These specimens and images are used to study
      different diseases and immune responses, and can be used to investigate ways to prevent or
      treat different medical conditions.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate blood and other tissue samples for immune responses to vaccines and natural
      infections.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age who agree to donate specimens for research
      purposes.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have clinical evaluations and will be asked to provide some of the
           following samples, depending on the research question being addressed. All procedures
           and sample donations are optional and voluntary:

        -  Blood samples through regular blood draws (for whole blood) and apheresis (to collect
           specific parts of the blood such as plasma or white blood cells)

        -  Urine, semen, saliva, or vaginal swab samples

        -  Tissue samples or biopsy specimens

        -  Undergo procedures such as bronchoscopy (lung and respiratory tract), gastrointestinal
           endoscopy (stomach and upper intestinal tract), or colonoscopy (lower intestinal tract)
           to obtain tissue samples

        -  Undergo imaging studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) or computed
           tomography (CT) scans

      Duration of participation is variable depending on the research question but will usually
      last up to 1 year.

      - Participants will be compensated for participation.

      Protocol Design:

      This is a specimen, imaging and data collection protocol designed with the purpose of
      understanding the immune responses to vaccines and infections in adult subjects through
      collection of tissue specimens and medical history data, and radiographic imaging. The
      information gained will enhance the knowledge of immune correlates of protection and will
      help in laboratory work related to the development and validation of immunological assays.
      This protocol will allow Vaccine Research Center (VRC) investigators and collaborators to
      evaluate tissue level immune responses in subjects who are recipients of Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-licensed vaccines, recipients of VRC clinical trials vaccines, control
      subjects, and naturally infected subjects as examples of naturally acquired immunity. Immune
      responses will be evaluated using blood, body fluids, mucosal and tissue samples,
      radiographic imaging and clinical evaluations. The underlying hypothesis for this protocol is
      that detailed studies of immune responses in blood and a diversity of tissue types, including
      a variety of mucosal surfaces, will further the understanding of immune responses following
      vaccination or recovery from an infectious disease and will advance development of vaccines
      against existing, new, and re-emerging pathogens.

      Subjects:

      Volunteers 18 years of age and older who agree to donate specimens for research purposes will
      be enrolled. A maximum of 500 subjects will be enrolled in the protocol.

      Study Plan:

      Subjects will receive information about study procedures and, if willing to participate, will
      sign the study informed consent. FDA-licensed vaccines may be administered to some study
      subjects as part of study participation. As per NIH Clinical Center (CC) policy, where
      appropriate, subjects will provide additional informed consent for study procedures.

      Duration:

      Individual subjects may donate samples as often as permitted by the protocol and NIH CC
      guidelines. The CC guidance on the volume of blood drawn and other inpatient/outpatient
      procedures will be followed. The protocol will undergo continuing review by the Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) annually.

        enrollment process.

        Able and willing to complete the informed consent process.

        Willing to donate specimens for storage to be used for research and to have genetic tests
        performed for research purposes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any medical, psychiatric, occupational condition or other condition that, in the judgment
        of the investigator, is a contraindication to protocol participation or impairs a subject s
