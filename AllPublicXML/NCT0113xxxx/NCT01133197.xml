      This study is designed to define the impact of thumb arthritis on patient's general health.
      As a secondary objective, data will be analyzed to determine the effects of medical and
      musculoskeletal comorbidities on the rating of upper extremity function by the patient.

      This study is designed to define the impact of thumb arthritis on patient's general health.
      As a secondary objective, data will be analyzed to determine the effects of medical and
      musculoskeletal comorbidities on the rating of upper extremity function by the patient.

      Potential Contribution: The data that we intend to gather could further our understanding of
      the overall health impact of thumb osteoarthritis and allow surgeons to more accurately
      interpret patient-rated measures of upper extremity function in the presence of
      comorbidities.

      Osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal joint is one of the most common sites of
      arthritic degeneration in the hand. To date, no study has examined this conditions impact on
      overall health using a validated health measure (e.g. SF-36). Additionally, no study has
      examined the impact of medical and musculoskeletal comorbidities on patient-rated measures of
      upper extremity function in these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults clinically diagnosed with thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis. The
             diagnosis must have been confirmed radiographically prior to consideration for study
             enrollment.

          -  Adults accompanying patients to participating offices will be recruited to be control
             subjects. They must not be receiving medical or surgical treatment for a hand or wrist
             complaint.

          -  Additionally control subjects must not have been diagnosed with thumb osteoarthritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be over 18 years of age and English speaking.

          -  Subjects are not to include incarcerated adults or those unable to provide consent for
             study participation.

          -  Patients diagnosed with currently symptomatic hand or wrist pathology outside of the
             thumb carpometacarpal joint will be excluded.

          -  Patient with prior surgery on the affected thumb will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant females are excluded from study participation with pregnancy determined by
             patient self-reporting (standard of care before office radiographs).
