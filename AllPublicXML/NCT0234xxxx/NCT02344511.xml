    <description>Patients with Creatine Clearance (CrCl) greater than 30 mL/min and patients receiving regular hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will receive 15 mg/kg Intravenous (IV) dalbavancin over 30 (+/- 5) minutes on Day 1 and on Day 8, not to exceed 1500 mg per administration in children at least 12 years and not to exceed 1000 mg per administration in children less than 12 years of age.
• Patients with CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min who are not receiving regular hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will receive 10 mg/kg IV dalbavancin over 30 (+/- 5) minutes on Day 1 and on Day 8, not to exceed 1000 mg per administration in children at least 12 years and not to exceed 750 mg per administration in children less than 12 years of age.
Additionally, subjects randomized to the dalbavancin group will receive an IV placebo infusion at times corresponding to comparator group dosage times for the first eight days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 2-16 yrs

          2. diagnosis of Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis (AHOM) of the long bones (ulna, radius,
             femur, tibia) defined by the following clinical signs and symptoms (&lt; 2 weeks in
             duration; multiple sites of infection within long bones):

          3. Limb abnormality: Pain, point tenderness upon palpation, motion restriction, loss of
             function

          4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -OR- Gram-positive cocci documented on a Gram-stain
             from a bone specimen or from blood cultures.

          5. Elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

          6. informed consent

          7. willing and able to comply with the study protocol

          8. Life Expectancy with appropriate antibiotic therapy and thru study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of
             study medication.

          2. Receipt of &gt; 24 hours of potentially effective intravenous antibacterial therapy for
             AHOM within 96 hours before randomization, unless the pathogen isolated was documented
             to be Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that was resistant to the
             administered antibiotic.

          3. Evidence of subacute or chronic osteomyelitis including: symptoms &gt; 2 weeks in
             duration

          4. AHOM of non-long bones (e.g., pelvis or spine).

          5. Extraosseous findings such as: subperiosteal abscess, pyomyositis, venous thrombosis,
             or pulmonary embolism.

          6. Previous history of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.

          7. Major trauma, open-fracture, puncture wound of the foot, post-operative osteomyelitis,
             foreign body in or adjacent to affected bone or joint, or other iatrogenic bone or
             joint infections present at the site of infection.

          8. Septic arthritis that is non-contiguous to osteomyelitis

             gastrointestinal surgery (within 2 months)

         13. Infection due to an organism known prior to study entry to be not susceptible to
             dalbavancin (dalbavancin mean inhibitory concentration &gt; 0.12 µg/mL) or vancomycin
