  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment duration of a novel early
      mobility training program (dynamic supported mobility, DSM) between 6 to 24 weeks of
      treatment; and to evaluate the clinical futility of this intervention compared to current
      rehabilitation practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind, randomized exploratory clinical trial with repeated assessments
      during a 24-week treatment phase and at three follow-up points over 12 months after treatment
      to track the developmental trajectory of participants' motor function. Gross motor ability
      will be compared to published percentile scores of motor function development in cerebral
      palsy (CP) to determine if the trajectory of predicted motor development is altered, and to
      outcomes of intensity-matched conventional treatment to determine if continued Phase III
      investigation is warranted.

    <measure>Change in Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Computation of the GMFM-66 score involves statistical weighting of the raw item scores for difficulty. This score will also be used with the patient's age to determine Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) percentile rank.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24, then at 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up sessions after treatment ends</time_frame>
    <description>Using computerized posturography, participants will sit for 3-5 ten second trials on the force platform while center of pressure data are collected. This process will be repeated in kneeling and standing positions if the participant is able to maintain these positions. Center of pressure data will be interpreted using nonlinear measures of analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24, then at 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up sessions after treatment ends</time_frame>
    <description>A wireless activity monitor will be provided to the caregiver, who will be instructed on use of the monitor at home, with a goal of recording 5 total hours of the child's free play in the following week. Amount and magnitude of physical activity will be calculated using corresponding software.</description>

    <description>Using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, one caregiver of each participant will rate their child's performance on the caregiver's self-identified goals, and then rate their own (caregiver's) satisfaction with the child's performance.</description>

    <description>One caregiver of each participant will complete the Child Engagement in Daily Life Measure to obtain a measure of the child's participation in play in daily life.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The conventional treatment group will receive traditional, therapist-directed pediatric physical therapy. Therapy will focus on early gait training strategies and encouragement of &quot;normal&quot; movement patterns for walking and other age-appropriate movements, with manual guidance or correction of atypical movements from the therapist. This group may use assistive devices, orthoses, and may receive static body weight support for gait training. Therapy activities will be performed in blocks of practice, with the specific activities and level of therapist assistance tailored to each child.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Dynamic Supported Mobility</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Children will receive dynamic weight support during all DSM treatment time. The environment will be arranged to encourage active motor exploration, somewhat similar to a play gym for toddlers, to promote the motor variability, engagement, and error experiences that characterize the typical development of upright motor skills and walking. The floor area within 3 feet below either side of the overhead track for a distance of 20 feet (approximately 120 ft2 total) will be defined with colorful thin rubber interlocking mats and arranged with pediatric toys and activities, tailored to the child's interests and to encourage motor skills just beyond his/her current ability. The therapist will minimally assist the child as needed to perform the movements he/she initiates.</description>

    <description>Dynamic weight support; Child-directed; No assistive devices, limited use of orthoses, no treadmill; Encourage high degree of error with reduced physical assistance; Encourage frequent variability in motor tasks (no redirection when moving from one activity to another); Physical therapist expertise is focused on designing a salient and challenging environment for the child's specific interests and ability level to encourage engagement, variability, challenge, and error experience, and on determining the appropriate amount of weight assistance</description>
