  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study examining the feasibility of implementing a large randomized control
      trial looking at the effect of endometrial shedding with medroxyprogesterone acetate compared
      to no pre-treatment in women taking clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction for
      infertility due to oligo-ovulation or anovulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of implementing a randomized
      controlled trial assessing the effect of giving medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to induce a
      withdrawal bleed compared to a control group of women not receiving MPA on pregnancy rates
      prior to ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate in oligo-ovulatory and anovulatory
      women. The primary outcome measure is the effective implementation of the study including a
      measure of time to recruit 50 patients, physician, nursing and patient compliance rate with
      the study protocol, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcome measures include the
      pregnancy rate per ovulation (where pregnancy is defined as a positive fetal heart rate on
      ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test), the ovulation rate per cycle started,
      conception rate per cycle started (where conception is defined as a positive beta-human
      chorionic gonadotropin level), conception rate per ovulation, time to complete 3 stimulation
      cycles and endometrial thickness at time of luteinizing hormone surge.
