  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate a collaborative self-management
      intervention in patients with moderate to severe COPD in a primary care population. To
      achieve this objective the investigators developed a diagnostic and treatment pathway for the
      management of COPD in primary care that is based on national guidelines and focused on
      patient self-management.

    <description>The proportion of subjects that were admitted to hospital for a COPD exacerbation An exacerbation is defined as an increase in or the onset of more than one respiratory symptom (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing, or dyspnea) lasting 3 days or more and requiring treatment with an antibiotic or a systemic corticosteroid. Respiratory status had to return to baseline for at least 72 hours before another exacerbation would be counted.</description>

    <description>A Certified Respiratory Educator (CRE) will obtain a detailed COPD history, provide general and self-management education, and confirm a management plan with the primary care physician. Specific elements of evidence-based management are targetted for intervention. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit in-person with the interdisciplinary care team including a CRE to review their health status including COPD symptoms, exacerbation diary, symptoms, MRC scale, etc as a minimum at 3 and 12 months. Telephone follow up will occur at a minimum at 6 and 9 months.</description>
