  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently reported that older patients with HIV are deficient in glutathione (GSH) due
      to decreased availability of cysteine and glycine, and that oral supplementation with
      cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) and glycine for 2-weeks corrects their own levels, and
      improves (but does not fully normalize) concentrations of red-cell GSH. We also found that
      when GSH deficient, subjects had impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and this improved with
      an increase in intracellular GSH concentrations. These older HIV patients also had
      significant increases in muscle strength with improvement of GSH levels.The current proposal
      in older HIV patients will investigate study if cysteine and glycine supplementation for a
      duration of 12 weeks will result in changes in : (a) GSH levels; (b) body
      composition/anthropometry; (c) strength and function; (d) quality of life; (e) mitochondrial
      energetics; (f) biochemistry (including dyslipidemia and oxidative stress); (g) protein and
      glucose metabolism; (h) cognition and memory. After completing supplementation for 3 months,
      GSH concentrations, strength, function, mitochondrial energetics and neurocognitive tests
      will be measured for a further 2 months to determine the effects of washout.
