    <textblock>
      This is a trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an Investigational
      eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014)
      guidelines.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,
      efficacy and safety trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an
      Investigational eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in approximately 645 subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014) guidelines.

      SUN-101 or placebo will be administered twice daily as an oral inhalation using the
      investigational eFlow CS nebulizer. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the
      substudy (at selected sites only). These subjects will be required to participate in serial
      spirometry, vital signs, ECGs, and an additional Holter monitor assessment at Visit 6 (Week
      12). This subset of subjects will be referred to as the Substudy Population.

    <measure>Standardized Change From Baseline at Week 12 in FEV1 Area Under the Curve (AUC) (0-12) in the Substudy Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ALL COLLECTED The standardized FEV1 AUC(0-12) was calculated at weeks 0 and 12 for the Substudy Population with extended spirometry measurements. The trapezoidal rule was used to calculate FEV1 AUC and then normalized to the length of time. Intermittent missing spirometry measurements were ignored and the trapezoidal rule would simply span the missing time point(s). If the Hour 12 time point was missing, then the AUC(0-12) calculation was based on the time interval up to the last non-missing time point prior to Hour 12. If a subject has a missing baseline FEV1, then that subject had a missing AUC. All collected values were used in the analyses, regardless if the subject remained on randomized treatment or not, and regardless if the values might potentially be affected by other therapies or not Values not collected remained as missing values and were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).</description>

        <description>ALL COLLECTED The standardized FEV1 AUC(0-12) was calculated at weeks 0 and 12 for the Substudy Population with extended spirometry measurements. The trapezoidal rule was used to calculate FEV1 AUC and then normalized to the length of time. Intermittent missing spirometry measurements were ignored and the trapezoidal rule would simply span the missing time point(s). If the Hour 12 time point was missing, then the AUC(0-12) calculation was based on the time interval up to the last non-missing time point prior to Hour 12. If a subject has a missing baseline FEV1, then that subject had a missing AUC. All collected values were used in the analyses, regardless if the subject remained on randomized treatment or not, and regardless if the values might potentially be affected by other therapies or not Values not collected remained as missing values and were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).</description>

The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD: symptoms, activity, and impacts. A score was calculated for each of these 3 subscales and a &quot;Total&quot; score was calculated. In each case the lowest possible value is 0 and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment of health status.
