    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any indication for PCI-S in patients deemed at high risk for bleeding and candidates for 1
        month DAPT. This includes candidates with stable angina, silent ischemia, ACS (STEMI and
        non-STEMI), non-native lesions and in-stent restenosis. Patients must provide written
        informed consent.

        Reasons of unsuitability for &gt; 1 month dual antiplatelet treatment must include one or MORE
        of the following:

          1. Adjunctive oral anticoagulation treatment planned to continue after PCI

          2. Age â‰¥ 75 years old

         10. Renal failure defined as: Creatinine clearance &lt;40 ml/min

         11. Thrombocytopenia (PLT &lt;100,000/mm3)

         12. Severe chronic liver disease defined as: patients who have developed any of the
             following: variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or jaundice

         13. Expected non-compliance to prolonged DAPT for other medical reasons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant and breastfeeding women

          3. Patients requiring a planned staged PCI procedure more than one week after the index
             procedure

          4. Procedure planned to require non-study stents, or stand-alone POBA or stand-alone
             atherectomy

          5. Active bleeding at the time of inclusion

          6. Reference vessel diameter &lt;2.25 ~ &gt;4.0mm

          7. Cardiogenic shock

          8. Compliance with long-term single anti-platelet therapy unlikely

          9. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel or other P2Y12
             inhibitor (if applicable), stainless steel, zinc, Biolimus A9 or a sensitivity to
             contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated

         10. PCI during the previous 12 months for a lesion other than the target lesion of the
             index procedure

         11. Participation in another clinical trial (12 months after index procedure)

         12. Patients with a life expectancy of &lt; 1 year
