Dose Expansion: Entospletinib 400 mg for 14 days and then entospletinib 400 mg in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine for up to two 14-day cycles. Some participants will have the option to receive post-induction therapy with entospletinib 400 mg in combination with cytarabine/cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C).

Participants who are intolerant of decitabine may switch to entospletinib monotherapy maintenance at any time after completing the first 2 cycles.
Dose Expansion: Entospletinib 400 mg for 14 days for the safety run-in participants or Entospletinib 400 mg for 5 days for the randomization participants. Then entospletinib 400 mg in combination with decitabine or azacitidine (at least 2 cycles of induction therapy but no more than 4 cycles). Some participants will have the option to receive maintenance therapy with entospletinib in combination with decitabine or azacitidine.
