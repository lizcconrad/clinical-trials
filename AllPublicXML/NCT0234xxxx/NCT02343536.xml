      The goal of the study is to identify a dose and schedule of CC-486 that can be safely
      administered with R-CHOP. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the
      maximal administered dose (MAD) of CC-486 in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in subjects with high risk (IPI 2 or more)
      previously untreated DLBCL or Grade 3B FL.

      Also, to determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-486 when administered alone and in combination
      with R-CHOP and to explore preliminary efficacy of CC-486 plus R-CHOP by 2007 International
      Working Group (IWG) criteria.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of oral azacitidine (CC-486) when
      combined with R-CHOP (the treatment regimen normally used in treating Diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma). This study also proposes to explore the
      pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine when administered in combination with R-CHOP and to
      assess the effects the drug can have on the human body, as well as the ability of CC 486 in
      combination with R CHOP to further effect the response of tumors associated with Diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, .

      Oral azacitidine in combination with R-CHOP has not been approved for the treatment of
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma and its use in this study is
      investigational. Various dose levels of this investigation treatment will be administered to
      subject enrolled into the study.

      This study is separated into three periods: Screening and Registration, Treatment and
      Follow-up periods. Before the patient can receive the study drug the doctor will perform
      tests to find out whether he/she can participate in the study. This is done during the
      Screening Period. If the patient and the treating physician determine that the patient is
      eligible to participate in the study, the patient will be registered in the study and
      assigned to receive one of the investigational dose levels of oral azacitidine.

      The Treatment period starts when the patient receives their first dose of the study drug. The
      maximum time the patient will receive study treatment is 5 months. The intent is for the
      patient to complete 6 cycles of treatment. Each cycle will be 21 days. The Follow-up period
      starts when the patient's treatment is completed or discontinued for any reason. The patient
      will have fewer exams, tests and visits once entering the follow-up period. These visits will
      be every 6 months for up to 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed previously untreated DLBCL or Grade 3B FL, [double-positive
             for BCL2 and c-MYC] or transformed lymphoma. Transformed lymphoma from FL or marginal
             zone lymphoma, but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [Richter Transformation] are
             allowed as long as no prior anti-lymphoma therapy of any kind has been administered.

               1. A formalin fixed paraffin embedded lymph node or tumor biopsy specimen must be
                  submitted during the Screening Period. The specimen must have been acquired by a
                  surgical or core needle biopsy (≥ 2 cores at baseline); material from a fine
                  needle aspiration is not acceptable.

               2. Fresh core biopsy, frozen, must be performed before start of therapy and
                  submitted for storage. This is optional only for the subjects who have a
                  biopsy-accessible site and consent to the procedure. In case no prior fixed
                  formalin paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy is available, this specimen can also be
                  used for diagnostic confirmation.

               3. No prior anti-lymphoma therapy. However, for subjects with bulky disease,systemic
                  symptoms, compressive disease, or rapidly progressing adenopathies, pre-phase
                  treatment with 1 mg/kg/day prednisone, or equivalent, for a maximum of 7 days is
                  permitted prior to Cycle 1 Day -6 at the discretion of the Investigator. In
                  exceptional cases, if clinically indicated, a higher dose of steroids and/or a
                  slightly longer duration is allowed for the purpose of urgent symptom management,
                  and the subjects is considered eligible. A washout period does not apply. However
                  the fresh core biopsy mentioned above should be performed before starting
                  prednisone.

          2. International Prognostic Index score ≥ 2 or DLBCL with double-positive for BCL2 and
             c-MYC by IHC (immunohistochemistry) or FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) based
             on local pathology lab assessment.

          3. Measurable disease on cross section imaging by CT (computed tomography) that is at
             least 1.5 cm in the longest diameter and measurable in two perpendicular dimensions as
             defined by IWG (International Working Group) response criteria for NHL (non-Hodgkin
             Lymphoma).

          4. Ann Arbor stage II to IV.

          5. Men and women 18 years of age to 80 years of age of any ethnic origin or race at the

          6. Understand and voluntarily sign an ICD (Informed Consent Document) prior to any study
             related assessments/procedures are conducted.

          7. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          8. Performance status ≤ 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          9. Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before starting study treatment on Cycle
             1 Day -6 for females of childbearing potential (FCBP). A female of child-bearing
             potential, defined as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy
             (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal
             of both ovaries) or, 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24
             consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time during the preceding 24

               1. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to the use of a physician-approved
                  contraceptive method (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
                  tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
                  vasectomized partner) without interruption, while on CC-486 (including dose
                  interruptions); and for 3 months following the last dose of IP; and

               2. Agree to have a medically supervised serum pregnancy test with sensitivity of at
                  least 25 mIU/mL obtained at Screening. A serum pregnancy test is to be performed
                  within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of starting study therapy on Cycle 1 Day -6, and
                  within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of every subsequent cycle, and at the Treatment
                  Discontinuation Visit. The subject may not receive IP until the Investigator has
                  verified that the result of the pregnancy test is negative.

         10. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must either commit to
             true abstinence* or agree to the use of a physician-approved contraceptive method
             throughout the course of the study and avoid fathering a child during the course of
             the study and for 3 months following the last dose of the IP (Investigational
             Product).

             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

             colitis),celiac disease (i.e., sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or
             any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the IP and/or predispose the subject to an
             increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.

          6. Hematologic and Non-hematologic exclusion criteria before start of therapy.

          7. Seropositive for or active viral infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV):
