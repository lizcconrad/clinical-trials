  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between radiation exposure and cardiac disease is well recognized, it is not
      fully understood if there exists an optimal or &quot;safe&quot; radiation dose-volume relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identification of &quot;safe&quot; dose volume constraints (DVC) for the heart from breast cancer
      radiotherapy would permit maximal oncologic benefit from radiation, identifying which
      patients require more complicated and resource consumptive radiation methods such as
      respiratory-gating or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and establish patients who need
      targeted follow-up for their long term cardiac risk. Two recent technical developments now
      make it conceivable to identify the dose-volume relationship between heart dose and
      subsequent cardiac event risk: 1. CT based three dimensional conformal radiation delivery
      methods (3DCRT) where the precise radiation dose to any given heart volume is known, and 2.
      Cardiac MRI (CMR) that is more sensitive to prior methods of cardiac evaluation (e.g. SPECT)
      for detecting and measuring cardiac injury.

      An MRI, subject health questionnaire, clinical and dosimetric data will be included in the
      analysis.
