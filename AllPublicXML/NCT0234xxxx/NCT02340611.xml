    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug or drug combination) to see
      how useful adding investigational drug cediranib to olaparib after disease progression on
      olaparib alone in patients with ovarian cancer.

      Cediranib works by blocking (inhibiting) several specific proteins in cancer cells called the
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. These proteins are important in the
      formation of blood vessels to the tumor. It is believed that many tumors survive because the
      blood vessels on the tumors bring oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cells which enable them
      to grow. If the formation of the blood vessels is blocked, the tumor cells may die.

      Olaparib works by blocking protein called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase
      (PARP). PARP is an important protein which tries to fix damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA,
      molecules that contain important instructions for the development of cells). Many cancers are
      though develop from damaged DNA. By blocking PARP from fixing damaged DNA, the tumor cells
      may die.

      Adding cediranib to olaparib, and therefore blocking several different mechanisms for cancer
      growth, may stop tumor growth.
