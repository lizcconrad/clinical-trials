    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      esketamine administered by the intranasal (administered through the nose) and oral routes and
      to evaluate the effects of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of intranasally
      administered esketamine.

      This is a single-center, 4-period, fixed-sequence, open-label study. The study consists of
      Screening Period (Days -21 to -2), Open-label Treatment Period 1, 2, 3, 4 and End of Study (9
      to 13 days after final dose or at Early Withdrawal). The total duration of study will be up
      to 98 days. For all 4 periods, the participants will be admitted into the study center on Day
      -1 of each treatment period and receive a 28 milligram (mg) (intravenous) or 84 mg (oral and
      intranasal) esketamine dose regimen on Day 1 of each period in a fixed sequence. Participants
      will also receive 500 mg of clarithromycin in period 4. Blood samples will be collected to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
