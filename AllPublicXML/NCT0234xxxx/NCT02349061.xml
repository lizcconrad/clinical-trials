    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab as measured by a
      reduction in disease activity for subjects with active Active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (SLE - chronic disorder of connective tissue in which there can be skin rash, arthritis,
      kidney problems, and anemia, among other problems).

      A multicenter (more than one medical research center involved in study), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know
      about the study drug), placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study of ustekinumab in
      participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Participants will be screened to
      achieve all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria and will then receive either
      ustekinumab or placebo along with concomitant background medicine. Participants will be
      primarily assessed for response using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Response Index 2000
      (SRI-4). Participants' safety will be assessed throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder index (SRI-4) is defined as a composite endpoint requiring at least a 4 point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score, no worsening (less than [Ë‚] 10 millimeters [mm] increase) from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity score (PGA) and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Domain A and no more than 1 new BILAG Domain B scores. The SLEDAI-2k assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity. The BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system, a letter score is given: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) = from 'very well'(0) to 'very poor'(10).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI - 2k) assessment consists of 24 items. Weighted scores of 8, 4, 2, and 1 are assigned for items 1 to 8, items 9 to 14, items 15 to 21, and items 22 to 24, respectively. A SLEDAI global score is derived by adding all weighted scores. Total possible score range for SLEDAI - 2K is 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

    <description>The Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS = 0 to 10 centimeters [cm]). The scale for the assessments range from 'no lupus activity' (0) to 'extremely active lupus' (10).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) requires participants to meet response criteria across 3 assessment tools and no treatment failure must be recorded: 1) BILAG improvement classified as: a) All BILAG A scores at baseline improved to either BILAG B, C or D b) All BILAG B scores at baseline improved to either BILAG C or D, c) No worsening in disease activity defined as no new BILAG A scores and &lt;= 1 new BILAG B score. 2) No worsening of total SLEDAI-2K from baseline (change &lt;= 0). 3) No significant deterioration (&lt;10 mm increase) in 100 mm visual analogue PGA scale.</description>

Participants will continue stable concomitant treatment through Week 48, as well as through the study extension although tapering of corticosteroids is encouraged beyond Week 48. Participants who complete or discontinue study treatment will be evaluated for 16 additional Weeks of safety follow-up.</description>
