      The study included 154 infertile women Patients received 100 mg of oral clomiphene citrate
      for five days starting on day 3 of the menstrual cycle, followed by daily injection of 150 IU
      of hMG and when more than two dominant follicles reached a diameter of 17 mm 5,000 IU of hCG
      was injected intramuscularly. Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups: Group C
      received IUI without ESI and Group S had ESI using No.8 neonatal feeding tube and after 24 to
      36 hours, IUI was performed. Successful pregnancy was con-firmed by ultrasound and patients
      had failed trial underwent another trial of IUI for a maximum of three trials.
