    <description>Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) subcutaneous (sc) injection 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 4, followed by CZP 200 mg every two weeks (Q2W) from Week 6 to Week 14.
The treatment received from Week 16 to Week 48 is based on initial treatment and response to treatment at Week 16:
Subjects with a PASI75 response at Week 16 will be re-randomized to receive either CZP 200 mg Q2W or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W; with Placebo administered on alternate dosing weeks to maintain the blind) or Placebo Q2W.
Subjects who do not achieve a PASI75 response at Week 16 will be removed from blinded study medication and escape to CZP 400 mg Q2W. Subjects who receive unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W for 16 weeks and do not achieve a PASI50 response will be withdrawn from the study.
Subjects can enter a 96-week open-label extension period after completing the Maintenance Period and receive CZP under certain conditions.</description>
