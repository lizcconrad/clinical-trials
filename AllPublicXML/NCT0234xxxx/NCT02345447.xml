  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study whether a herbal-based medication is superior to
      placebo for prevention of acute otitis media in pre-school children with upper respiratory
      tract infection.

      This is a prospective, controlled parallel-group comparison for superiority of Otovowen®.

      Patient will be identified by screening of patient cards. Patients with recurrent AOM aged 12
      to 59 months will be randomly assigned either to Otovowen® or placebo. Randomization will be
      stratified by age at enrolment (12-35 versus 36-59 months).

      The observation period per subject will be 6 months. Data collection and documentation will
      be performed weekly via online diary by the parents/legal representative(s) and by the
      investigator via eCRF.

      Patients will be seen by the doctor at baseline and at end of study. Unscheduled visits in
      case of AOM or severe URI or any other disease are initiated by the parents/legal
      representative(s).

      Study medication will be sent to the patient/parents/legal representative(s) after
      randomization. and will be administered at first signs or symptoms of URI (e. g. elevated
      temperature, common cold, influenza, coughing, sore throat, hoarse voice, frequent sneezing,
      running or stuffy nose, sinusitis, fever, headache, etc.) until resolved (maximally 8 weeks
      of continuous application).

      AOM will be diagnosed during unscheduled visits according to the criteria detailed in the
      study protocol. An AOM will be considered as resolved through confirmation by the
      investigator only.

      Compliance will be assessed by weighing contents of bottles of IMPs.
