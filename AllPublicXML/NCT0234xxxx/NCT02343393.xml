  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomised, clinical trial assessing the efficacy of Hydralazine and
      Isosorbidedinitrate combination (oral agents) in HF patients with renal dysfunction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), where renal failure and heart failure (HF) co-exist in a vicious
      cycle, is a very common problem of great morbidity and mortality. The management of CRS is
      challenging as therapeutic options are mutually contradictory and largely empirical.

      Endothelial dysfunction from oxidative injury has recently emerged as a common link between
      the failing heart and kidneys in CRS. The endothelium plays an obligatory role in
      cardiovascular homeostasis, and impaired endothelium-mediated nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability is the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. There is a high prevalence of
      endothelial dysfunction in our Asian HF patients, with a greater degree of dysfunction seen
      in those with CRS. We hypothesise that targeting endothelial dysfunction may improve clinical
      status among Asian patients with CRS.

      Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) increases NO bioavailability. Concomitant hydralazine (H) therapy
      prevents nitrate tolerance and protects NO from oxidative stress-induced degradation. The
      synergistic combination of H-ISDN is thought to exert beneficial effects on the endothelium.

      We aim to perform a prospective randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of H-ISDN
      therapy for 6 months on exercise capacity, endothelial function, renal function, clinical
      outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in Asian patients with CRS. Specifically, we hypothesise
      that H-ISDN therapy will lead to improvement in exercise capacity (6 minute walk test
      (6MWT)), endothelial dysfunction (assessed by non-invasive peripheral arterial
      tonometry(PAT)), renal function, cardiac structure and function, clinical outcomes (all-cause
      mortality, HF hospitalisations) and QOL in Asian patients with CRS.
