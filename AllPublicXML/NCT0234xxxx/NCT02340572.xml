    <textblock>
      AnticalinsÂ® are engineered human proteins that are able to bind specific target molecules.
      The Anticalin PRS-080#022-DP to be investigated in this study is directed against hepcidin
      and is intended for treatment of anemia of chronic disease. This phase I First-in-Human study
      shall investigate safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy human volunteers.

      First-in-Human (FIH), randomized, dose-escalation, double-blind, placebo-controlled single
      dose in healthy volunteers.

      The single rising dose study will enroll 8 subjects per cohort (6 verum, 2 placebo), up to a
      maximum tolerated dose, defined by stopping rules. 6 dose levels are anticipated. Study drug
      will be administered as i.v. infusion on Day 1. The decision to escalate the dose by the dose
      escalation committee (DEC) will be based on an interim analysis of clinical safety and safety
      laboratory data.
