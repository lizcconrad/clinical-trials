      This study is a cross-sectional case-control study where classical as well as more innovative
      risk factors for CVD will be explored.

      In western countries, more women than men die of cardiovascular disease (CVD), making CVD in
      women an important public health issue. Misdiagnosis of CVD in women is frequently observed,
      posing the clinician for diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas that can easily result in
      inadequate treatment and worse prognosis. Despite these challenges, CVD in women has been
      underexposed in scientific research.

      Women have gender-specific risk factors like a history of preeclampsia (PE) that contribute
      to their risk for CVD. PE complicates 5-10% of pregnancies, recurs in ~25% and is associated
      with a 2-4 fold increased risk for CVD. Moreover, pre-symptomatic heart failure (HF) stage B
      occurs in 40% of women with a history of PE. HF stage B is thought to precede the development
      of the, mortality related, clinical HF stages C and D (structural heart disease in
      combination with symptomatic disease). Early detection and tailored intervention of women
      with stage B HF decreases progression to the clinical stages and might therefore improve
      clinical outcome and cardiovascular related mortality.

      Phenotypic presentation of HF is currently split up between systolic HF also called HF with
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and diastolic HF or HF with preserved ejection fraction
      (HFpEF). Women more often have HFpEF in contrast to men. Different pathophysiology and
      disease progression in women compared to men seems to be an important underlying factor. The
      current clinical HF diagnostic tools (e.g. natriuretic hormones and high sensitivity
      troponins) fail to identify early changes that prelude adverse cardiac remodelling and HF,
      and do not discriminate between HFrEF and HFpEF. Moreover, there are sex-related differences
      in biomarker levels for detection of CVD. As a result, clinicians are forced to wait for the
      failing heart to become clinically evident before they can intervene. Therefore, there is an
      urgent need to assess novel biomarkers that could help select high risk women needing further
      follow up and intervention. Biomarkers may not only improve early diagnosis but may also
      unravel disease pathways of HFpEF. Especially when combined with measurements of subclinical,
      surrogate risk markers.

      Objectives

        -  To determine the impact of PE on incidence of macro-and micro-vascular dysfunction
           reflected by surrogate measures for coronary artery disease (CAD) and HFpEF.

        -  To perform a genome wide association study (GWAS) and associate novel biomarker
           expression levels with endothelial function, cardiac diastolic function and IMT
           measurement.

        -  To identify risk factors and surrogate measures for CVD in a) former PE patients without
           HFpEF, b) former PE patients with HFpEF and c) healthy parous controls.

      Study population Cases: women with a history of PE Controls: women with uncomplicated
      pregnancies in the history. Measurements will be performed in clusters at postpartum
      intervals of: ½-2, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-30 years. Number of inclusions will be: 425, 350, 282
      and 233 for each follow-up group respectively.

      Primary endpoints The prevalence of macro- and microvascular dysfunction in former PE
      patients. Novel biomarker detection in former PE patients associated with HF in general and
      HFpEF in particular.

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Lifestyle (questionnaire)

        -  Cognitive ability (questionnaire)

        -  Depression score (questionnaire)

        -  Metabolic syndrome (MetS)

        -  Arterial endothelial function (Flow mediated dilation (FMD))

        -  Intima Media Thickness (IMT)

        -  Glycocalyx thickness (by means of the Glycocheck)

        -  Venous function (plethysmograph)

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)

      The investigators will perform an unbiased screen for the human genome content of circulating
      microRNAs. Standard HF biomarkers will be included so that the added value of these novel
      HFpEF miRNAs can be directly compared to established HF biomarkers. In this cohort of women
      who experienced pre-eclampsia and matched controls the investigators will profile miRNAs on a
      genome wide scale using total RNA from plasma. Differentially expressed miRNAs will be
      further investigated in relation to the pathogenesis of micro- and macrovascular disease.
      Selected miRNAs will be placed on a custom megaplex array and used to screen a cohort of
      patients with HFpEF. In patients with HFpEF the investigators will relate miRNA expression
      level to the circulating levels of angiopoietin-2/ang-1ratio's and micro-albuminuria. Part of
      the obtained blood and urine will be stored at the Biobank in Maastricht for future studies.
