    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 basiliximab when
      given together with standard combination chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant in
      treating patients with mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Radioactive substances linked to
      monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 basiliximab, can bind to cancer cells and give
      off radiation which may help kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan (BEAM), work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving yttrium Y 90 basiliximab and chemotherapy before a stem
      cell transplant may help kill any cancer cells that are in the body and help make room in the
      patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Stem cells that were
      collected from the patient's blood and stored before treatment are later returned to the
      patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if administration of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA (yttrium Y 90 basiliximab), when
      given in combination with standard dose BEAM, as conditioning for autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplant (AHCT), is safe, by evaluation of toxicities, including type, frequency,
      severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA when given in
      combination with standard dose BEAM, in patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) as
      part of conditioning for AHCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery in terms of neutrophil and platelet
      engraftment time.

      II. To estimate radiation doses to the whole body and normal organs through serial imaging
      studies.

      III. To estimate overall survival, progression-free survival, non-relapse mortality and
      cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 100-days (non-relapse mortality [NRM] only),
      1-year and 2-years.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 basiliximab.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 basiliximab intravenously (IV) on days -21 and -14, carmustine
      IV over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6, cytarabine IV twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2,
      etoposide IV BID on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 100, and 180 days and 1,
      1.5, and 2 years.
