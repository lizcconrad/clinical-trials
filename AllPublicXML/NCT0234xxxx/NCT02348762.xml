  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously reported that older patients with HIV are deficient in
      glutathione (GSH) due to decreased availability of cysteine and glycine, and that oral
      supplementation with cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) and glycine for 2-weeks corrects their
      own levels, and improves concentrations of red-cell GSH. The investigators also found that
      when GSH deficient, subjects had impaired mitochondrial energetics and this improved with an
      increase in intracellular GSH concentrations. The current proposal will investigate if
      cysteine and glycine supplementation for a duration of 24 weeks will result in changes in :
      (a) GSH levels; (b) body composition/anthropometry; (c) strength and function; (d) quality of
      life; (e) mitochondrial energetics; (f) biochemistry (including dyslipidemia and oxidative
      stress); (g) protein and glucose metabolism; (h) cognition and memory. 3 months after
      completing supplementation, measurement of GSH concentrations, strength, function,
      mitochondrial energetics and neurocognitive tests will be done to determine the effects of
      washout.
