  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of intravenous crystalloids is ubiquitous in the care of the critically
      ill. Commonly available crystalloid solutions contain a broad spectrum of electrolyte
      compositions including a range of chloride concentrations. Recent studies of associated
      higher fluid chloride content with acute kidney injury and mortality but no large, randomized
      trials have been conducted. In preparation for a large, cluster-randomized,
      multiple-crossover trial comparing 0.9% sodium chloride to physiologically-balanced isotonic
      crystalloids (Lactated Ringers or Plasmalyte-A) in intensive care unit patients, this pilot
      study will enroll all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at a single
      tertiary center for a sixth month period. The primary objective will be to test the ability
      of an electronic order entry tool to ensure administration of assigned study fluid or record
      contraindications to assigned study fluid. The pilot study will also demonstrate the
      feasibility of collecting demographic, severity of illness, fluid management, vital sign,
      laboratory, acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy, and outcome data in an
      automated, electronic fashion.
