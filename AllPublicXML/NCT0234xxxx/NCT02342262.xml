      RATIONALE: The prevalence of migraine is higher in patients with various intestinal diseases.
      An explanation could be that migraine is caused by a 'leaky gut': an increased intestinal
      permeability that allows food particles to pass the gastrointestinal wall. Probiotics may be
      able to improve intestinal barrier function.

      OBJECTIVE: To test whether probiotics, as adjuvant therapy, can reduce incidence and severity
      of migraine attacks by reducing intestinal permeability.

      STUDY DESIGN: 12-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind intervention with selected
      probiotics.

      STUDY POPULATION: Adults who experience at least 4 migraine attacks per month. INTERVENTION:
      Subjects will receive either one daily dose of 2 g of Ecologic® Barrier or 2 grams of the
      placebo, containing only the carrier material (both provided by Winclove Probiotics).

      MAIN STUDY PARAMETERS/ENDPOINTS: Incidence and severity of migraine attacks, measured by
      diaries and validated headache questionnaires will be measured at baseline and after 4, 8,
      and 12 weeks of probiotic/placebo administration. Secondary, intestinal permeability will be
      measured by the lactulose/mannitol absorption test in urine (screening, baseline and 12
      weeks) and by fecal zonulin (baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks). Inflammation will be assessed
      from blood C-reactive protein and cytokine concentrations (baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks).
      Fecal samples will also be used for microbial analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects confirm to have migraine characterized by :

               -  Recurrent attacks of moderate to severe headaches, often one-sided and pounding,
                  often with nausea and/or vomiting, aggravated by physical activity

               -  Sensitivity for light or sounds is possible but not exclusive.

               -  Attacks last for 4 to 72 hours.

          -  Self-reported frequency of migraine attacks (or days) at least 4 per month

          -  Fairly predictable/stable pattern of migraine attacks (frequency, duration, intensity)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Good overall health (self-reported in medical questionnaire)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Migraine patients who suffer from chronic daily migraine/headaches

          -  Migraine patients who suffer from medication-dependent headaches

          -  Subjects who suffer from cluster headache or tension-type headaches

          -  Subjects who used antibiotics up to two months before the start of the study

          -  Subjects who are unwilling to stop taking probiotics other than study products

          -  Patients with a chronic use of non steroid anti inflammatory drugs (because of
             increased gut permeability)

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (because of increased gut permeability)

          -  Pregnancy or lactation (because of their possible effect on migraine incidence)
