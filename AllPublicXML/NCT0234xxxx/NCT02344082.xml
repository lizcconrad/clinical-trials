      This prospective study will include both an intervention and control arm. The control arm
      will receive face-to-face pharmacy clinic visits per standard of care. The intervention arm
      will receive pharmacy clinic visits plus additional telephone follow-up. Patients with a
      hemoglobin A1c in the last 3 months greater than 9% will be eligible. Eligible patients must
      have a primary care physician at Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center (JHOC) or East Baltimore
      Medical Center (EBMC).

      Purpose: To compare the change in hemoglobin A1c over the 3 month study period in the
      intervention group in which patients participate in telemedicine, to a control group in which
      they do not
