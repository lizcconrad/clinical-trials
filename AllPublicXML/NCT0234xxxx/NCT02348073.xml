  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project aims to develop a new therapeutic approach in epilepsy-associated attention
      disorders in children, through evaluation of the clinical impact of dietary n-3 fatty acids,
      containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) conjugated to a
      phospholipid vector. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a PUFA
      supplementation (PS-Omega 3), after 12 weeks of treatment, on attention disorders in children
      with epilepsy. Secondary objectives include:

        -  To evaluate the impact of a supplementation of PS-Omega 3 on quality of life.

        -  To evaluate the impact of a supplementation of PS-Omega 3 on serum and erythrocyte lipid
           profiles.

        -  To assess the tolerance of a supplementation of PS-Omega 3.

        -  To assess the impact of a supplementation of PS-Omega 3 on the frequency of seizures.

        -  To describe the impact of a supplementation of PS-Omega 3, at 24 weeks,

             1. on attention disorders in children with epilepsy,

             2. on quality of life,

             3. and on serum and erythrocyte lipid profiles. This study will recruit 272 subjects
                aged 6- 16 years, suffering from epilepsy (any type) and attention deficit
                hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (inattentive or combined type) according to DSM V
                criteria in 12 clinical sites in France.

    <measure>Reduction of the ADHD-rating scale IV inattentive subscore in subjects assigned to supplementation of PS-Omega 3 in comparison with the placebo group after 12 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD Rating Scale-IV quantifies each of the 18 symptoms of ADHD on a 0 to 3 scale, with a maximum score of 54 points. Nine of the 18 items score for inattention while the nine others assess hyperactivity with a maximum of 27 points each. The discriminative value of these two subscales was validated, allowing their individual use.</description>
