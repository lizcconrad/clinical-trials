    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open label Phase II study of the combination of intravenously
      administered SGT-53 and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer as a first-line treatment. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, toxicity and efficacy (specifically Progression Free Survival at 5.5 month
      (PFS5.5mos)) of this combination therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The p53 is a vital human tumor suppressor gene. Loss of p53 suppressor function is present in
      the majority of human cancers. The p53 protein has a diverse range of functions including
      regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell death (apoptosis), senescence, DNA repair,
      maintenance of genomic integrity, and control of angiogenesis. Abnormalities of the p53 gene
      may impact the efficacy of standard anticancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy.
      P53 mutation and pathway dysfunction are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the
      presence of the p53 mutation correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The
      development of somatic gene therapy has created the potential to restore wild type function
      of p53. SGT-53 is a complex of cationic liposome encapsulating a normal human wild type p53
      DNA sequence in a plasmid backbone. This complex has been shown to efficiently and
      specifically deliver the p53 cDNA to the tumor cells. Introduction of the p53 cDNA sequence
      is expected to restore wtp53 function in the apoptotic pathway. P53 restoration has been
      shown most effective in enhancing cytotoxicity in combination with an agent which results in
      DNA damage or initiates apoptosis. This is a Phase II clinical trial of SGT-53 plus the
      recently approved chemotherapeutic combination of gemcitabine/Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) as a
      first-line therapy in patients with confirmed metastatic pancreatic cancer. In addition to
      determining Progression Free Survival at 5.5 months (PFS5.5mos), this trial will evaluate the
      response rate, overall survival and time to progression as well as the tolerability and
      safety of SGT-53 in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.

    <description>A course of therapy will include 7 weeks of treatment. In week 1, SGT-53, at 2.4 mg DNA/infusion, will be administered on day 1 and day 5, 1000 mg/m² gemcitabine and 125 mg/m² nab-paclitaxel will be administered on day 3 of each week except week 4. If the combination is well-tolerated, starting at week 2, 3.6 mg DNA/infusion of SGT-53 will be administered bi-weekly on days 1 and 5 in weeks 2-3, weekly on day 3 in week 4, and weekly on day 1 in weeks 5-7. Patients who are responding to treatment may receive one additional course (7 weeks) of SGT-53/gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel therapy at investigator discretion. If still responding to treatment, they may continue on gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alone at investigator discretion.</description>
