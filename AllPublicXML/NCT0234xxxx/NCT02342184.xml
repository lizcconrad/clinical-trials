      This study will carry out to assess the efficacy of GB-0998 (intravenous
      immunoglobulin;400mg/kg/day for five days) in the treatment of the Guillain-Barré Syndrome
      based on the changes in Hughes Functional Grade (FG) as primary endpoint, and in addition, to
      assess the safety of GB-0998.

             is progressive, patients with FG is grade 3 involve in this study).

          3. Patients with plasmapheresis, steroids and immune globulin therapy is no operation for
             this onset.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Patients who have been diagnosed as hereditary fructose intolerance.

          3. Patients who have impaired peripheral neuropathy except Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          4. Patients with history of volatile organic solvent abuse, abnormal porphyrin
             metabolism, history of pharynx or cutaneous diphtheria, plumbism, poliomyelitis,
             botulism, hysterical paralysis, toxic neuropathy.

          5. Patients who have received treatment of malignant tumors.

          6. Patients who were administered immunoglobulin within 8 weeks before informed consent.

          7. Patients who have been diagnosed IgA deficiency in their past history.

          8. Patients with severe renal disorder or decreased cardiac function.

             these diseases.

         10. Patients with high risk of thromboembolism.

         11. Pregnant, lactating, and probably pregnant patients.
