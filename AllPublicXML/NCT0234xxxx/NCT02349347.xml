      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of intensified intravenous Melphalan in
      combination with a transplant of patients' own blood stem cells for a maximum of three
      cycles.

      In a recently completed small Phase I study looking at the use of higher doses of intravenous
      Melphalan with the combination of lenograstim (a drug that stimulates bone marrow to produce
      white blood cells helping to fight infection) and patients' own blood infusion over 4 cycles
      of treatment has proved encouraging. The results of this study showed rapid improvement in
      pain and a fall in circulating tumour cells within two weeks of starting Melphalan. However,
      slow platelet recovery after the fourth cycle meant longer periods of platelet transfusion.
      For this trial we intend to assess the efficacy of an intensified intravenous Melphalan with
      transplant of patients' own blood stem cells over a shorter time period. This study will
      involve approximately 39 patients over a 3 year period.
