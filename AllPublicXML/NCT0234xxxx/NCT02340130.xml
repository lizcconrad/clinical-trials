  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomised, prospective safety study in patients
      with rhinitis or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, with controlled asthma, and clinically
      relevant sensitisation to dust mites from the Pyroglyphidae and Glycyphagidae families.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the administration of two
      allergen extracts of dust mite mixtures at 200 DPP/ml (DP/MG/14-1 Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus / Blomia tropicalis and DP/MG/14-2 Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus /
      Lepidoglyphus destructor) using a rush build-up phase in patients with allergic rhinitis or
      rhinoconjunctivitis, with controlled asthma.
