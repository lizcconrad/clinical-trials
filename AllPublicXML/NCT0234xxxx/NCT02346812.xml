  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy individuals (n=18) will participate in 2 controlled-feeding study periods that are 3
      weeks each in length: 1) Control diet 2) Brassica diet. The control diet will consist of
      typical American foods and will be free of Brassica vegetables and free of glucosinolates and
      isothiocyanates. The Brassica diet will contain the control diet plus
      glucosinolate/isothiocyanate treatment foods. There will be a break of 3 weeks in between
      study periods. Blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected at the end of each study
      period. Eligible participants will be selected based on genotype for glutathione
      S-transferase (GST), which has been shown to influence the potential protective role of
      dietary Brassicas. Half the participants (n=9) will be GSTM1-positive individuals and half
      (n=9) will have the GSTM1-null genotype.
