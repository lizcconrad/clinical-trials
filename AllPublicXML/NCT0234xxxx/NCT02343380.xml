    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at analyzing whether eating a standard meal in the evening (at 8:00 pm)
      determines in the same individuals a lower diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and a different
      hormonal response than the consumption of the same meal in the morning (at 8:00 am).

      The primary outcome is: the intra-individual variation in DIT after the evening and morning
      meal consumption.

      The secondary outcomes are the intra-individual variations in glucose, triglyceride, insulin,
      free fatty acids, leptin, glucagon-like peptide-1, acylated ghrelin, adrenalin, noradrenalin,
      after the evening and morning meal consumption.

      Twenty healthy volunteers (ten males and ten females) are recruited among students and
      graduates attending the Department of Medical Sciences of Turin (Italy) to take part to this
      randomized cross-over trial.

      Participants randomly receive first the standard meal at 8:00 am and the week after the
      standard meal at 8:00 pm or vice versa. Eight-h before the meal (respectively at 12:00 pm or
      at 12:00 am), the participants receive the same standard meal (without protein
      supplementation) at their home, and then are asked to spend in bed the following 6 hours. A
      24-h urine collection is collected the day before each test in order to determine total
      urinary nitrogen excretion.

      The standard meal consists of: 100g white bread, 100g ham, 50g cheese, 125g yogurt, 200ml
      fruit juice, plus 25g protein supplement. The participants must consume each meal in 25-30
      minutes.

      A 30-min basal calorimetric (Deltatrac II) exam is performed. Participants remain in a supine
      position but awake and motionless on a hospital bed during the whole period, except during
      the meal, when they can sit to eat. At 8:00 am (or pm), the participants consume the meal,
      and then rest in a supine position for 90 min. Then, a second 60 min-calorimetric evaluation
      is done. From the first calorimetric exam (the basal) until the end of the second
      (post-prandial) blood samples are drawn every 30 min. The same time schedule is adopted in
      the case of the morning meal (at 8:00 am) and the evening meal (at 8:00 pm).

      The random sequence (morning/evening, evening/morning meal) is computer-generated, using
      blocks of different lengths in random order.

      The following are measured: weight, height, waist circumference, and at baseline and every
      30-min during the morning and evening tests: glucose, triglyceride, insulin, free-fatty
      acids, leptin, glucagon-like peptide-1, acylated ghrelin, adrenalin, noradrenalin.

        <title>Variation in Morning Glucose and Insulin Area-Under the Curve (AUC)s After the Consumption of a Meal at 8:00 am Compared With Evening Glucose and Insulin AUCs After the Consumption of the Same Meal at 8:00 pm</title>
        <description>Glucose and insulin values measured every 30 minutes after meal for 180-min. Time 0 was before the meal. Times 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 were referred to the time intervals in minutes from the beginning of the meal. AUCs were calculated according to the trapezoidal model.
Serum glucose was measured by enzymatic colorimetric assay; serum insulin was determined by immunoradiometric assay.</description>
