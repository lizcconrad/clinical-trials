      This is a phase Ib, open label, multicentre study of AZD1775 administered orally in
      monotherapy and in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in Asian patients with
      advanced solid tumours. The study design allows escalation or de-escalation of AZD1775 in
      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients. Approximately 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the
      dose-finding portion of this study. The total number of patients will depend upon the number
      of combination dose level evaluations necessary to define the recommended dose for further
      clinical evaluation. The proposed combination doses are : Dose level-1; Dose level 1; Dose
      level 2 (if Dose Level 1 tolerated). All combination doses other than Combination Dose level
      1 may be subject to change by the SRC in light of emerging data. At least 3 and up to 6
      evaluable patients will be required for each dose finding cohort. Once the recommended dose
      for further clinical evaluation is established, additional 3 to 6 patients may be enrolled to
      the cohort where the recommended dose has been defined to further characterise the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy profiles of AZD1775 in combination with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. If this dose is subsequently found to be non-tolerated,
      alternative doses and/or schedules may be explored. This will be determined by the SRC.

    <description>To characterize the PK profile of AZD1775 after single dosing and at steady state after multiple dosing when given orally to patients with advanced solid tumours in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Timing of PK samples may be adjusted during study, dependent on emerging data, in order to ensure appropriate characterisation of the plasma concentration time profiles. Total volume of blood taken from each patient during Cycle 0, day 1 and Cycle 1, days 1 and 3 will not exceed approximately 250 mL. PK parameters determined for AZD1775 for Day 1 Cmax •C8hr (AZD1775 only) •Time to Cmax (tmax) •Time of last detectable concentration (tlast) •Terminal half-life (t½λz) •Area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC(0 8)) (AZD1775 only), from 0 to time of last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t)), from zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞)), and from zero to 12 h (AUC(0-12)), Day 3 •Accumulation on day 3 compared to day 1 for Cmax and AUC(0-8)</description>

    <description>AZD1775 will be administered orally as a single dose on Day 1 Cycle 0. Following a 5±2 days washout period, AZD1775 (5 doses BID over 2.5 days) will be taken in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in each 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Following 6 cycles of combination treatment, patients may continue on AZD1775 monotherapy (5 doses BID Day 1 to Day 2.5 in each 21-day cycle) at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <description>Following the paclitaxel infusion, carboplatin will be administered at a dose of AUC 5 as an IV infusion on Cycle Day 1 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. According to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Information Letter Regarding the AUC Based Dosing of Carboplatin, the maximum carboplatin dose should not exceed the target AUC (mg*min/mL)*150 mL/min, but it may be less (Ivy et al 2010). For this study, the maximum dose of carboplatin cannot exceed a total dose of 750 mg.</description>

             does not have well characterised PK profile) or 5 × half-lives of the first dose of
             study treatment

          -  Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products (ie,

             a narrow therapeutic index, or to be moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP3A4, which cannot be discontinued 2 weeks before Day 1 of dosing and withheld
             throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
             Co-administration of aprepitant during this study is prohibited.

          -  AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The use of statins
