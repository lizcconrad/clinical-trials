  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SEMAINE project will investigate intracranial EEG (icEEG) simultaneously recorded with
      either fMRI or MEG to 1) improve identification of the epileptogenic zone in patients
      suffering from drug-resistant partial epilepsy, and 2) define the functional organization of
      neural networks underlying human perception and cognition in order to prevent inadvertent
      deficits resulting from neurosurgical resection. In particular, high-frequency activity
      (HFA), as measured with icEEG, has been demonstrated in recent years as a relevant index for
      both epileptogenic tissue and healthy cortical processing, but its correlates in fMRI and MEG
      require further investigation. This will be a pioneering effort in several respects, as the
      first to directly measure high-frequency neural activity in tandem with fMRI, and among the
      first to do so with MEG. In addition to their attractiveness as noninvasive imaging
      techniques, fMRI and MEG have the potential to examine whole-brain networks that are not
      accessible to icEEG's necessarily limited spatial coverage. Furthermore, such a campaign of
      simultaneous recordings will take unprecedented advantage of icEEG as the bridge between the
      two noninvasive techniques, providing compelling evidence for the links between all three
      measurements with respect to underlying high-frequency neural activity in both health and
      disease. This project will therefore lead to improved selection of epilepsy surgery
      candidates and improved neurosurgical outcomes from the precise mapping of epileptogenic and
      healthy brain networks. The same techniques will be immediately applicable to functional
      mapping of other types of neurosurgery populations as well as diagnostic neuroimaging of
      neurological and psychiatric populations.
