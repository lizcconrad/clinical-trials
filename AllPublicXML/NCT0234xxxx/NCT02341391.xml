  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the this study is to evaluate the safety of TissueGene-C, a gene
      therapy product that uses allogenic human chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth
      Factor(TGF)-β1 by assessing the inflammation at the injection site, the incidence and
      severity of the adverse events, the physical examination findings, and the laboratory test
      results after the intra-articular injection of TissueGene-C.

      And Secondary purpose is to evaluate the biological efficacy (knee pain, range of motion,
      functional tests, and MRI) of TissueGene-C and the distribution of TissueGene-C outside the
      injection site.

      TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocyte cells and
      transduced chondrocyte cells that express growth factor to modify osteoarthritis symptom for
      long term period.

      During clinical trial Phase 1, we compare three different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 6
      months with 12 outpatients with degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized by three
      different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 1:1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded
      for alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of
      adverse events.
