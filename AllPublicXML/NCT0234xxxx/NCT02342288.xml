    <textblock>
      A rare but terrible complication of vision loss has been known to occur after surgery,
      including spine surgery. It is commonly thought that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is
      one of the reasons for this rare vision loss. It has been shown that the prone position can
      increase the IOP, and that tilting the patient with the head down can also increase IOP. The
      investigators will be measuring IOP before, during, and after a posterior spine surgery to
      see if the investigators can influence the intraocular pressure with elevated head position
      change. Two groups will be studied: one group of patients will receive standard care with the
      head in neutral position, while the other group will have the head slightly elevated 10
      degrees during prone spine surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that postoperative vision loss after lumbar surgery is increasing. It is
      an uncommon but devastating complication. One of the risk factors that has been reported is
      increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which may decrease perfusion pressure to the optic
      nerve. Intraocular pressure in anesthetized, prone spine patients has been studied with the
      head in neutral position. The prone position and duration of the procedure did increase the
      IOP. Our hypothesis is that adjusting the position of the head in space will alter the
      intraocular pressure, with an extended position decreasing IOP. This study is a, randomized,
      controlled design: neutral head position (standard care) or extended head position
      (intervention group). Patients who qualify for spinal fusion surgery and meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to either the neutral (standard practice) or the intervention
      group.Randomization of patients will be computer generated.

    <description>The objective is to determine if slight elevation of the head (10 degrees up from neutral) can decrease the IOP compared to remaining in neutral position (standard of care) for the entire surgery. The mean values for Δ IOP measurements (i.e. two eye average maximum IOP - two eye average baseline IOP obtained at first prone measurement).</description>

A final measurement was taken after turning the patient supine and 5 minutes elapsed for equilibration.</description>
