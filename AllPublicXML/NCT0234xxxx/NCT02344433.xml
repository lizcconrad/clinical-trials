  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Relational Agent (RA) &quot;virtual counselor&quot; (VICKY: VIrtual Counselor for Knowing Your Family
      History) has been developed to collect family health history information for common health
      conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension and various cancers. In
      this study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the
      efficacy of using VICKY to the existing My Family Health Portrait (MFHP) tool for collecting
      family health history information among an underserved primary care patient population. The
      primary aims of the study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of VICKY versus MFHP for collecting
      accurate family health histories and 2) determine whether accuracy varies as a function of
      health literacy. This project will obtain validation data on the efficacy of both VICKY and
      MFHP for collecting accurate family history data among an underserved patient population, in
      two languages (English and Spanish). The study will determine whether a virtual counselor can
      overcome many of the existing barriers to using traditional web-based family history tools.

    <description>Sensitivity will be calculated using an interview with a genetic counselor as the gold standard. Sensitivity will be defined as the health conditions identified by the family health history tool (VICKY or MFHP) that were also identified by the genetic counselor (true positive) divided by the health conditions not captured by the tool but captured by the genetic counselor (false negatives) plus the true positives.</description>
