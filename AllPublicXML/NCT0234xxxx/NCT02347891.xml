      The goal of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belimumab as a maintenance
      therapy in adults with refractory Idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) as compared with
      standard of care. This is a multicentre double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects enrolled in the study must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Adults &gt;18 years of age

          2. Have a diagnosis of:

               1. definite or probable dermatomyositis (DM) or

               2. Definite or probable diagnosis of polymyositis (PM) with presence of one of
                  myositis specific antibodies. In the absence of myositis specific
                  auto-antibodies, the diagnosis of PM will require review of the muscle biopsy and
                  adjudication by the predetermined committee of experts.

          3. Presence of positive autoantibody (ANA &gt;1:80 or RNP or SSA/SSB or any of the myositis
             specific autoantibody: antisynthetase autoantibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, EJ, OJ,
             KS), anti-SRP, anti-Mi-2, anti-p140).

          4. Have refractory IIM as defined by inadequate response or intolerance to at least 3
             months of glucocorticoids and/or at least one other immunosuppressive agent, such as
             azathioprine, methotrexate, IVIG, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, tacrolimus,
             cyclosporine cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab.

          5. Have active IIM at screening. This requires at least 3 criteria from the CSM

          6. Dermatomyositis patients that do not meet the MMT criteria, must have:

               1. a cutaneous VAS score of &gt;3 cm on a 10 cm VAS scale (MDAAT) will be required:

               2. elevation of at least one muscle enzyme (creatine kinase [CK]; aldolase; lactate
                  dehydrogenase [LDH]; alanine aminotransferase [ALT]; or aspartate
                  aminotransferase [AST]) to a minimum level of 1.3 times the upper limit of
                  normal,

               3. and 1 additional core set measure

          7. For patients with ≥ 7 years of IIM, muscle biopsy or muscle MRI within 4 months prior
             to enrollment will be required to document active myositis to avoid enrolling patients
             with significant index of damage/ muscle atrophy. This is not applicable to DM
             patients with a cutaneous VAS score of &gt;3 cm on a 10 cm VAS scale (MDAAT).

          8. Have a stable background glucocorticoid therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to

          9. Have a stable immunosuppressive therapy (IS) (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil,
             tacrolimus, cyclosporine for &gt; 2 months prior to screening. Patients on intravenous
             gamma globulin (IVIG) have to be on a stable dose and frequency regimen for ≥ 3
             months.

         10. Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and provide written
             informed consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related

             study visits)

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             screening and agree to 1 of the following:

               1. Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the
                  1st dose of study agent until 16 weeks after the last dose of study agent (Sexual
                  inactivity by abstinence must be consistent with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception); or

               2. Consistent and correct use of 2 of acceptable methods of birth control for 1
                  month prior to the start of the study agent, during the study, and 16 weeks after
                  the last dose of study agent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Have severe muscle damage as defined by a Muscle Damage Index (MDI) &gt; 5.0 cm using a
             visual analogue scale (VAS) 10.0 cm in length or evidence of severe muscle atrophy on
             muscle MRI.

             confirmatory hepatitis C viral load by PCR.

         17. Clinically significant elevation of GGT (&gt;1.5xULN), bilirubin (&gt;1.25xULN, direct 35%),
             or INR (&gt;1.2, excluding patients on anti-coagulant therapies) or other clinically
             significant abnormal laboratory value in the opinion of the investigator.

         18. Have current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol
             abuse or dependence within 364 days prior to Day 0.
