      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the Spineology Interbody Fusion System
      (SIFS) in an instrumented interbody lumbar fusion in subjects presenting with symptomatic
      single-level lumbar degenerative disc disease.

    <textblock>
      This regulated prospective, multi-center, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
      single-arm performance goal clinical investigation will be conducted at a maximum of 15
      centers with no more than 102 subjects being enrolled and treated.

      It is anticipated that enrollment will be compete within 24 months. Subjects will be actively
      evaluated to 24-months postoperative and depending on enrollment duration, may be remotely
      assessed through self-administered surveys at 36- and 48-months.

      The primary endpoint, assessed at 24-months postoperative, is a composite score that includes
      pain, function, fusion and safety assessments.
