  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if by giving a combination of 3 drugs the leukemia
      will go into complete remission (meaning the leukemia is completely gone), and to find out
      how long it stays away. The drugs used in this project are FDA approved and commercially
      available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are diagnosed in patients older
      than 65 years of age. The median age of patients at time of diagnosis is 67 years. Standard
      therapies for AML often have significant toxicity and are poorly tolerated by this patient
      population. Treatment strategies for elderly patients with AML are limited. In those patients
      who do achieve complete remission, duration of remission tends to be short. Treatment at time
      of relapse is exceedingly difficult and outcomes are dismal. Thus, there is need for safer
      and more effective therapies for elderly patients with AML. This trial is a novel therapeutic
      combination of deferasirox (Exjade), cholecalciferol, and azacitidine in patients 65 years or
      older with newly diagnosed AML who are not fit for standard induction chemotherapy or
      hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
