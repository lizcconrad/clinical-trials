  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized trial to calculate incidence of Herpes Simplex Virus in an
      in-patient burn population and determine efficacy of prophylactic antiviral therapy to
      prevent viral infection and/or reactivation. Hypothesis is that antiviral prophylaxis will be
      effective in reducing HSV infection/reactivation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized trial of antiviral prophylaxis of at risk individuals has yet to be
      performed. We anticipate that the disease burden in our population of burn patients will be
      large, especially in patients who exhibit high risk characteristics, and hypothesize that
      antiviral prophylaxis will significantly reduce the incidence of Herpes Simplex Virus in the
      burn population. This study will have a profound impact on the treatment of burn patients
      both at our own institution and throughout the country. Prophylactic treatment using
      Acyclovir in burn patients would decrease patient morbidity, pain and suffering and would
      likely positively impact scarring, wound healing, and, ultimately, patient satisfaction and
      quality of life. Reducing the incidence of HSV infections will decrease the length of
      hospital stays for many patients, saving both health care expenses and resources. If
      prophylactic Acyclovir becomes standard of care treatment for burn patients, this treatment
      plan would be a tremendous public health breakthrough for preventing HSV outbreaks and could
      be extrapolated to researching similar protocols for other health conditions.
