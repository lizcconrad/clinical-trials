  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Identifying individual
      patients at risk of a suture adverse events, including myocardial infractions (heart
      attacks), remains a major diagnostic challenge. Recent studies have shown that coronary
      plaques responsible for hear attack are composed of a large lipid core with a thin overlying
      fibrous cap. Although these features can be identified using invasive imaging modalities,
      non-invasive imaging options remain limited due to their poor spatial resolution. Recently
      the investigators have developed and validated a novel tool that will allow us to
      characterise coronary plaque composition based on dual source CT images. Our aim is to assess
      this tool within a cohort of patients who have already undergone a coronary CT as part of a
      previous study.

      Reliable identification of coronary plaque at risk of causing future adverse cardiovascular
      events would allow patient-specific targeting of intensive therapy. The majority of events
      are precipitated by coronary plaque rupture, with ruptured plaques exhibiting a large
      necrotic, lipid core with superimposed thrombus. The proposed precursor lesion shares similar
      plaque compositional features to ruptured plaques but with a thin overlying fibrous cap and
      is termed a thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA)1. At present there is a major emphasis on imaging
      modalities that can identify these higher-risk plaque subtypes.

      We have previously validated an invasive imaging modality, virtual-histology intravascular
      ultrasound (VH-IVUS) against histology, and found that VH-IVUS identified TCFA with a
      diagnostic accuracy of 74%2. In prospective studies, VH-defined TCFAs were associated with a
      7x greater risk of future events than other plaque subtypes3. Although this technique shows
      promise in permitting plaque-based risk stratification, it is limited by its invasive nature.
      Thus, alternate, non-invasive imaging options are required for more widespread risk
      assessment.

      Recently, we have devised a novel method of creating &quot;Plaque Maps&quot; using CT attenuation data
      individualised to each patient (Figure 1), which permits identification of coronary plaque
      components with a diagnostic accuracy of 75%-85%4. However, whilst CT Plaque Maps could
      identify fibroatheroma with similar diagnostic accuracy to VH-IVUS (79% vs. 74%), the spatial
      resolution of CT was unable to detect the thin fibrous cap and distinguish fibroatheroma from
      TCFA (Figure 2). More recently we have introduced necrotic core/fibrous plaque ratio as a
      possible Plaque Map surrogate for identification of TCFA. Using a ratio of &gt;0.58, the
      sensitivity to detect a TCFA was 84% and specificity 75%; an improvement over all previously
      identified CT-defined features of high risk plaques4. Whether this novel strategy can
      prospectively improve identification of plaque vulnerability is unproven.

        This study will be an observational, retrospective, single center cohort study based at
        Papworth Hospital NHS Trust, including up to a maximum of 100 patients. The patients have
        already been identified through their participation in a previous research study, as stated
        above. Additional inclusion criteria are; age &gt;18 years and the ability to provide informed
        consent. The only exclusion criterion is the inability of the participant to provide
        informed consent.
