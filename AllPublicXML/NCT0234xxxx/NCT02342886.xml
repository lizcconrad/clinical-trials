      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination
      of moxifloxacin, PA-824, and pyrazinamide treatments with varying doses and treatment lengths
      from 4 to 6 months in subjects with drug-sensitive (DS) pulmonary TB compared to standard
      HRZE treatment.

      This study will also assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination of
      moxifloxacin, PA-824, and pyrazinamide treatments after 6 months of treatment in subjects
      with multi drug-resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB compared to a combination of moxifloxacin,
      PA-824, and pyrazinamide treatments in DS-TB subjects.
