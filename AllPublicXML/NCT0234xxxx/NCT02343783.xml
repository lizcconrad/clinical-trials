      The purpose of this study is to characterize the cell (the basic building block of all living
      things) populations and inflammatory (pain and swelling) mediator responses in suction skin
      blister fluid after allergic skin reaction (ASR) [rash] induction with D. Pteronyssinus
      [house dust mite (HDM)], Alternaria alternata, or Aspergillus fumigatus allergens in
      participants with atopic dermatitis (AD) [Skin rash, Eczema] or allergic asthma (AA)
      [breathing disorder in which there is a wheezing and difficulty breathing].

      This is an interventional (a treatment given during the course of a research study) and
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study. The study will consist of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (Up to 4 weeks), Data
      Collection Phase (9 days) and, Follow-up Phase (7 days). The maximum study duration for each
      participant will not exceed 43 days. Primarily, the cell populations and inflammatory
      mediator responses in suction skin blister fluid after allergic skin reaction (ASR) will be
      assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
