      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lpathomab in
      healthy volunteers. Additional endpoints include characterization of the pharmacokinetic
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicity profiles of a single IV dose of Lpathomab in
      healthy volunteers.
