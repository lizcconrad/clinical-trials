    <textblock>
      Anemia of pregnancy is defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dL in the
      first and third trimesters, and less than 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester. The rates of
      anemia are variable and depend largely on preexisting iron stores and supplementation.
      Estimates from the World Health Organization report that 35% to 75% of pregnant women in
      developing countries and 18% of women from industrialized countries are anemic. Maternal
      anemia is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for
      gestational age infants. Many studies have shown improvement in these outcomes with maternal
      iron supplementation in cases of iron-deficiency anemia. Mounting evidence also indicates
      that maternal iron deficiency in pregnancy reduces fetal iron stores, perhaps well into the
      first year of life.

      Anemia in pregnancy can also impact maternal morbidity and mortality. Viteri reported that
      anemic pregnant women are at greater risk of death during the perinatal period and that
      anemia is the major contributory or sole cause of death in 20-40% of the 500,000 maternal
      deaths per year.

      The need for iron averages close to 1000mg in a typical singleton gestation. This amount
      considerably exceeds the iron stores of most women and will result in iron-deficiency anemia
      unless supplemental iron is taken. One problem with iron supplement use is compliance,
      secondary to adverse effects such as constipation and nausea. Research on the use of cast
      iron pots in decreasing the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in non-pregnant women has
      been promising. These studies have demonstrated good compliance with no reported adverse
      effects. The aim of our study is to determine if providing anemic women in the first
      trimester of pregnancy with a cast iron pot will decrease the incidence of anemia later in
      pregnancy.

      Hypothesis: Cooking in cast iron pots will increase hematocrit levels in pregnancy.

      Research Question: Will the addition of cast iron pots to the standard of care (nutrition
      counseling, food recall, prenatal vitamin, +/- iron and vit c) improve the hematocrit of
      pregnant women with anemia? Study Intervention: To provide a cast iron pot to those pregnant
      women with anemia who are randomized to intervention group and an aluminum pot to those women
      in the control group. Women will be blinded to their allocation. Women with a qualifying
      hemoglobin will meet with our nutritionist (as they would if not enrolled in the study), and
      she will perform a standardized 24 hour food recall and nutrition counseling according to the
      standard of care, as well as perform written informed consent. The 24 hour food recall will
      be submitted to the manufacturer (Nutrition Quest) to calculate the baseline iron intake of
      each subject. Subjects will be enrolled only if they can agree to incorporate the provided
      pot into their cooking (in any capacity) 3x/week. Subjects will be called 1x/month and asked
      about the frequency of pot use over the past month as well as their compliance with iron and
      vitamin C supplements, if prescribed. Subjects will then also be contacted postpartum to
      determine satisfaction with the intervention.

      Outcome measure: We will be looking at hemoglobin levels in the first, second, and third
      trimester as well as postpartum (which are all routinely collected labs in pregnancy).
      Ferritin will be added along with routine labs at approximately 19 weeks as this is often
      performed in the workup of anemia. No labs outside of routine maternal labs will be
      performed.
