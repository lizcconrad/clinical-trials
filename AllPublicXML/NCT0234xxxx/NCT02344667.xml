  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies support the use of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for the
      treatment of localized prostate cancer (PrCa). SBRT is a way to deliver radiation very
      precisely allowing higher doses to be delivered with fewer treatments, potentially improving
      patient outcomes. Cyberknife and Volume Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) are accepted SBRT
      techniques. However, the effects of the specific SBRT treatment technique on patient outcomes
      have not been evaluated in randomized trials.

      Although such a trial would be of great interest, patients' willingness to participate is
      unclear. Multiple patient and clinician factors contribute to the decision to enter a
      randomized trial. This feasibility study will evaluate patients' willingness to participate
      in a trial comparing Cyberknife and VMAT SBRT for the treatment of early stage PrCa. Patients
      accepting enrolment will be randomized to one of the two types of SBRT delivery. Up to 66
      patients will be approached, and up to 40 randomized. A questionnaire will help to identify
      the factors influencing the patient's decision to participate or not. This study will gather
      information on feasibility, PSA control, patient outcomes and side effects, and will inform
      the design of a future randomized phase II/III study.
