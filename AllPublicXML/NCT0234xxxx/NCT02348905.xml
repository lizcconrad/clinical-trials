      ACTHAR gel has efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown cause. Although sarcoidosis
      most commonly affects the lung3, it may affect any organ. Although corticosteroids are
      recognized as the drug of choice for sarcoidosis, ACTH is the only drug that is FDA-approved
      for this disorder. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of ACTH for this condition.

      Presently, corticosteroids as considered the drug of choice for the treatment of cutaneous
      sarcoidosis. However, ACTHER GEL not only has obvious anti-inflammatory effects by resulting
      in corticosteroid production, but it may also activate melanocortin receptors. The
      melanocortin system has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial in the
      treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have biopsy-proven sarcoidosis.

          2. a) Patients with active cutaneous sarcoidosis and two active lesions on stable therapy
             or no therapy for at least two months AND/OR b) Patients with active cutaneous
             sarcoidosis and lupus pernio lesions on stable therapy or no therapy for at least two
             months. A maximum of 5 patients may be enrolled fulfilling criterion b) above.

          3. Both lesions must have a SASI induration score of &gt; 1 and a SASI induration + erythema
             score of &gt; 2.

          4. If two lesions are present, one must be &gt; 1cm in diameter and the subject must be
             willing to have it biopsied. The second lesion must be at least 0.5 cm in diameter.

          5. If a subject has only lupus pernio facial lesions, one needs to be at least 0.5 cm in
             diameter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous toxic or allergic reaction to ACTHAR gel

          2. The presence of another skin condition in addition to sarcoidosis that would interfere
             with the assessment of the sarcoidosis skin lesions.

          3. Uncontrolled hypertension.

          4. Uncontrolled diabetes.

          5. Active infection.

          6. A medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would place the subject
             at significant risk by administering ACTHAR gel.
