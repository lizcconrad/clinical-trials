  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators study is to investigate the effects of anaesthetic
      preconditioning with sevoflurane during organs harvesting in brain dead donors. More
      particularly, the investigators will investigate whether sevoflurane preconditioning protects
      against ischaemia-reperfusion the livers and kidneys allografts after a prolonged period of
      cold ischaemia and whether this protection translates in a better clinical functional
      recovery of these allografts.
