  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group multicenter
      study evaluating once daily FF/UMEC/VI (100 microgram [mcg]/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) inhalation
      powder versus twice daily budesonide/formoterol (400 mcg/12 mcg). The primary purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function and health status for subjects treated
      with FF/UMEC/VI compared with budesonide/formoterol for 24 weeks. Once-daily 'closed' triple
      therapy of a Inhaled Corticosteroid/ Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting
      Beta-Agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) combination FF/UMEC/VI (100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) in a single
      device is being developed with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management
      of advanced (GOLD Group D) COPD which will reduce the exacerbation frequency, allow for a
      reduced burden of polypharmacy, convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in
      lung function, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established
      dual/monotherapies.

      Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have successfully completed all
      protocol procedures at the Screening Visit will enter the two-week run-in period. Following
      the run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to one of the following
      double-blind treatment groups: FF/UMEC/VI 100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA™ dry powder
      inhaler (DPI) once daily in the morning and placebo via reservoir inhaler twice daily OR
      Budesonide/formoterol 400 mcg/12 mcg via reservoir inhaler twice daily and placebo via the
      ELLIPTA DPI once daily in the morning.

      The target enrollment is 1800 randomised subjects at approximately 200 study centers
      globally. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 27 weeks,
      consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 24-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period.
      Subjects will run-in on their existing COPD medications for 2 weeks and in addition will be
      provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on an as-needed basis (rescue
      medication) throughout the study. Subjects will discontinue all existing COPD medications
      during the randomised treatment period but may continue their study supplied rescue
      albuterol/salbutamol. A sub-set of approximately 400 subjects will remain on blinded study
      treatment for up to a total of 52 weeks to provide additional long term safety data.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. At least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) may be obtained. The largest FEV1 value among the 3 acceptable efforts will be recorded. Trough FEV1 on treatment at Week 24 is defined as the FEV1 values obtained prior to morning dose of investigational product. The Mixed Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis for trough FEV1 will include. FEV1 measurements at Treatment Day 1 (baseline) and Treatment 24.</description>

    <measure>Number of on-treatment moderate and/or severe COPD exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Annual rate of on-treatment moderate and severe exacerbations will be compared between FF/UMEC/VI and budesonide/formoterol. Moderate exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbation will be defined as worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with in-patient hospitalization.</description>

             sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female
             subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.
             For this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records.; Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of &gt;10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or

             (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms
             that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
             exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics
             alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or
             sputum purulence (colour). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD). Alpha1-antitrypsin
             deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of
             COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,
             interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Subjects at potentially high risk (e.g. very low Body mass index [BMI],
             severely malnourished, or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of
             the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded.

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Abnormal Chest X-ray (CXR): Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence

             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a CXR at Screening Visit 1) (or historical radiograph or Computed
             Tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that will be
             over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide a post
             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,

             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid,
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy &gt;3litres/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use &lt;=3L/min flow is not exclusionary.)

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             albuterol/salbutamol for the 4-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at
