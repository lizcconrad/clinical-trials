  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, 17000 cases of severe hematological diseases are diagnosed in France, with more
      than 6,000 of these requiring hospitalization in a protective, sterile environment. New
      methods, such as touch massage, have emerged in response to anxiety symptoms observed in
      patients in such sterile and isolated surroundings. We hypothesize that during the period of
      isolation, touch massage becomes a nursing care which can help the patient.
