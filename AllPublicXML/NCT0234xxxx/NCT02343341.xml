      Project 1. Primordial/primary behavior change in children

      Problem: Childhood obesity has more than doubled over the past 30 years, with nearly
      one-third of children aged 6 to 11 years being obese. These children are more likely to
      become obese adults and are at a higher risk for the development of diabetes, hypertension,
      heart disease and cancer.

      Approach: This research tests the hypothesis that habits are formed very early in life and
      that children can help their parents live healthier lives. The investigators attempt to test
      this hypothesis by evaluating the impact of an educational program focusing on diet, physical
      activity, knowledge of the human body, and management of emotions for preschool children aged
      3 to 5 years, their parents/caregivers and teachers. The investigators will first assess the
      environmental factors, facilitators, and barriers to implementation of a health promotion
      educational program tailored for preschoolers in Harlem, New York. This information will be
      used to tailor the educational program for the children in Harlem. The investigators will
      evaluate the effectiveness of the program in children aged 3 to 5 years by randomly assigning
      blocks of schools to an up to 5-month educational and playful health promotion intervention
      or to usual curriculum. The program will also have components for teachers and parents of
      these children in order to make their learning environment conducive to positive change. The
      impact of our program will be assessed on children's knowledge, attitudes, habits, weight,
      exercise and diet using simple questionnaires and measurements.

      Impact: The investigators expect to demonstrate a positive impact on knowledge, attitudes and
      habits in preschool children in an under-served population. Also aim is to demonstrate that
      this early educational program can increase the proportion of preschool aged children with
      normal weight. This approach has the potential to meaningfully modify the projected rise in
      obesity and cardiovascular disease by affecting an entire generation of children. The
      investigators believe that the healthy habits that the children will acquire through this
      program will lead them to be healthier adults. Thus, the mission aligns closely with the
      American Heart Association's mission of, &quot;Building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular
      diseases and stroke&quot;.

      Aim 1- Pilot, 1st Year: In the 1-year initial pilot period, the investigators will identify
      the contextual factors, facilitators and barriers that may impact the implementation of a
      preschool-based health promotion educational program in Harlem, using qualitative research
      methods: 1) focus group discussions among teachers; 2) focus group discussions among
      community leaders; and 3) focus group discussions among parents of preschool-aged children.

      Subsidiary Aim 1.1: To use identified facilitators and barriers to develop a contextually and
      culturally appropriate model for a preschool-based health promotion educational program.

      Subsidiary Aim 1.2: To implement a pilot intervention of the contextually and culturally
      adapted program at two preschools in Harlem. The investigators will assess for acceptability
      and feasibility, and make any necessary modifications prior to the implementation of the
      cluster-randomized trial.

      Aim 2- Randomization, 2nd Year: To evaluate the effectiveness of the preschool-based health
      promotion educational program on KAH-BEA: knowledge (K), attitudes (A), habits (H), BMI Z
      score (B), exercise (E) and Alimentation (A)(KAH-BEA) of 600 preschool children, using a
      composite questionnaire-based score (KAH score) measuring the parameters related to the
      domains of diet, physical activity, health of the body and heart, and management of emotions,
      and weight and physical activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that preschool children receiving the health promotion
      educational program will demonstrate a higher composite KAH score than controls.

      The investigators hypothesize that a higher proportion of preschool children receiving the
      health promotion educational program will be eutrophic (B) than controls.

      The investigators hypothesize that preschool children receiving the health promotion
      educational program will show higher levels of exercise and physical activity (E) and
      healthier diets (A) than controls.

      For Aim 2, 600 preschool children will be recruited from up to 20 schools in Harlem, NY, and
      perform a 2:1 (2 intervention: 1 control) cluster randomization of the schools. The preschool
      children, their teachers and their parent/caregivers will receive our intensive educational
      program for a period of up to five months. The primary assessments mentioned in Aim 2 will
      occur at five months. At that time, the control schools will crossover to receive the
      educational program over the next five months.

      Aim 3-Sustainability, 3rd and 4th year: To evaluate the sustainability of the impact of a
      preschool-based health promotion educational program on the KAH-BEA of preschool children.

      The investigators hypothesize the impact of an up to 5-month health promotion education
      program on the knowledge, attitudes, health, BMI, exercise level and diet of preschool
      children will be sustained out to 36 months.

      For Aim 3, the 600 preschool children will continue to be follow after all of them have
      received the educational intervention until the end of the grant period (36 months). The
      intent is to follow these children beyond the grant period (separate intramural/extramural
      funding will be sought), as were done for previous studies in Colombia and Spain conducted by
      the investigators. The completion of this project will allow the assessment of effectiveness
      of multilevel approaches that intervene on children's environments and that aim to alter
      early life systems will prove to be effective in improving health habits in children and
      caregivers. The long-term expectation for these interventions is that they will reduce
      adolescent and adult obesity in these children and lead to improved CVD outcomes.
