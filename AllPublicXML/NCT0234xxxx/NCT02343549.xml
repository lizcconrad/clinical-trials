  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients will complete best standard of care radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab (6
      weeks). Within two weeks of completion of this initial treatment period, study patients will
      be fitted with the NovoTTF-100A System and treated continuously. They will be treated with
      TTFields for 12 months for an average of 18 hours per day. The patient may elect to take a
      treatment break for a total of 3 days per month, for each month and still be in compliance.
      This will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays on the head. The
      patients will also continue with maintenance temozolomide/ bevacizumab.

      This study will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will enroll a cohort of 22
      patients. The FDA will review safety data of the first 15 patients during enrollment of the
      first cohort. Enrollment and interim analysis of the first cohort of patients will be
      completed within 15 months of study commencement. Upon FDA approval and favorable interim
      analysis followed by subsequent protocol/consent amendment (as applicable), the second stage
      will enroll a cohort of 24 patients and will be completed within 15 months of stage 2
      commencement. The overall duration of the study is expected to be no longer than 30 months.
