  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an escalating issue, with an accompanying increase in referrals of patients with
      obesity-related respiratory failure. Currently, these patients are electively admitted to
      hospital for initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), but it is unknown whether
      outpatient initiation is as effective as inpatient set-up. The investigators hypothesise that
      outpatient set up using an auto-titrating NIV device will be more cost effective than
      nurse-led inpatient titration and set-up.

      The investigators will undertake a multi-national, multi-centre randomised controlled trial.

      Subjects will be randomised to receiving usual inpatient set-up, which will include nurse-led
      initiation of NIV or outpatient set-up with an automated NIV device. Subjects will be
      stratified according to trial site, gender and previous use of NIV or continuous positive
      airway pressure. Assuming 10% drop out rate, a total sample of 82 patients will be required.
      Cost effectiveness will be evaluated using standard treatment costs and health service
      utilisation and using health related quality of life measures (SRI and EQ5D). Change in the
      severe respiratory insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire will be based on analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA) adjusting for the baseline measurements between the two arms of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increase of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure as a consequence of
      obesity. The current treatment options for patients with obesity related respiratory failure
      is non-invasive ventilation (NIV). This has shown to reduce partial pressure of arterial
      carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and improves symptoms such as dyspnea (breathlessness)and enhances
      quality of life. NIV has also shown to increase physical activity (using actigraphy)and there
      can be associated weight reduction after three months of initiation.

      Currently, the length of an inpatient stay for NIV set up is between 4.5 and 6 days. As yet
      it is unknown whether or not a patient can be set up onto NIV as effectively on an outpatient
      basis using an AE-AVAPS (Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure - Average Volume
      Assured Pressure Support) algorithm compared to the usual practice of inpatient titration by
      specialist respiratory nurses. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of outpatient initiation
      vs inpatient initiation is unknown in this group of patients.

      This will be the first trial to assess the cost effectiveness of such a set up.

    <intervention_name>Outpatient NIV Set Up using AVAPS AE (Manufactured by Philips-Respironics)</intervention_name>
    <description>Intervention set ups will follow a standard protocol for the automated device (A40 AVAPS-AE machine;Manufactured by Philips-Respironics, Murraysville, Pittsburgh, US) and patients will be discharged with the machine and a full face mask or nasal interface. Patients will then undergo a 1-2 night home oximetry study to ensure adequate control of overnight oxygenation. Patients will be reviewed clinically as an outpatient at 6 weeks and adherence to non-invasive ventilation will be evaluated and an arterial blood gas measurement will be undertaken. A full clinical review and optimisation of NIV and interface will be performed at this visit. Patients will be reviewed at 3 months as an inpatient where overnight transcutaneous carbon dioxide level and SpO2 studies will be performed. All other patient-centred, physician-centred and healthcare utilisation measurements will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months.</description>
