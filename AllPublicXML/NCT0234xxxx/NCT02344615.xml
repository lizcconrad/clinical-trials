      The investigators compared the postoperative analgesia of nerve stimulator-guided and
      ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block for upper extremity surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral nerve block has increased in popularity. It has many
      advantages such as improved success rate, faster onset time, fewer needle passes, shorter
      performance time, and reduced procedural pain and vascular puncture. However, there is no
      information about postoperative analgesia.

      Therefore, the investigators tested whether ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block enhanced
      the postoperative analgesia for upper extremity surgery compared with nerve stimulator (NS)
      guidance.

    <description>Patients received a standard single injection infraclavicular block using the lateral sagittal approach of Klaastad. The infraclavicular brachial plexus is identified using an insulated needle connected to a nerve stimulator. Placement of the needle is considered adequate if motor response of radial nerve in the hand or wrist is still present at 0.2 - 0.5mA. Ropivacaine 0.5% 35ml is used.</description>

    <description>Infraclavicular block is performed under ultrasound guidance. Linear probe is placed in a parasagittal positon below the clavicle medial to the coracoid process and adjusted to achieve a cross-sectional image of the axillary artery. Using in-plane technique, an 22-gauge insulated needle is advanced caudally and posteriorly to the axillary artery. Subsequently, 35 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine is incrementally injected.</description>
