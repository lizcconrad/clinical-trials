      The investigators plan to test the effectiveness of warm gel gloves in reducing the time it
      takes individuals to fall asleep (sleep latency). The investigators will have subjects track
      their sleep for two-weeks using both sleep logs and a small wristwatch-like monitor called an
      actigraph to measure the degree of the persons' difficulty falling asleep. It must take at
      least 30-minutes to fall asleep 3-days per week to qualify for the study. If a subject
      qualifies, they will wear the heated gel gloves or a placebo non-heated gel glove during
      sleep for two-weeks and sleep will be measured again using sleep logs and actigraphy. The
      baseline sleep latency data will be compared to the treatment period using a independent
      t-test. The investigators believe that wearing the warm gel gloves will reduce sleep latency.

      Insomnia affects anywhere from six percent to 33% of the U.S. population depending on the
      precision of the definition being used. Therefore, represents one of the most prevalent
      health concerns for Americans. Individuals with insomnia frequently report problems such as
      (but not limited to) difficulty focusing and concentrating, memory difficulties, impaired
      motor coordination, irritability and impaired social interactions. Moreover, chronic insomnia
      has also been associated with reduced quality of life, higher absenteeism, impaired job
      performance, and higher healthcare utilization.
