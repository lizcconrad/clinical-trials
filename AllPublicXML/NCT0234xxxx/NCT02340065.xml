  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate Endocuff- assisted colonoscopy in terms of its possible
      additive contribution in the detection of important lesions, namely polyps and cancers,
      compared to standard colonoscopy, in a series of patients undergoing back-to-back screening
      or surveillance colonoscopies in a randomized fashion. Moreover, we aim to assess possible
      changes regarding post-polypectomy surveillance programs following Endocuff utilization.

      Tandem colonoscopies studies results, show that novel endoscopic technologies detect about
      20% more adenomas than those conventional colonoscopy does (missed adenomas). Since
      Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy cannot be considered as a perfect examination, we hypothesize
      that conventional colonoscopy will detect one third of the missed adenomas that
      Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy detects in a similar setting. Therefore a sample size of 120
      adenomas achieves 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 3.0 using a two-sided McNemar test
      with a significance level of 0.05. The odds ratio is equivalent to a difference between two
      paired proportions of 14% which occurs when the proportion of detected missed adenomas during
      Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy is 21% and the proportion of missed adenomas during
      conventional colonoscopy is 7%. During one year period before the study initiation, our
      colonoscopy performance quality data show that we detect a mean number of adenomas per
      patient equal of 0.7 in a population similar to the one recruited in our study. Therefore,
      172 patients overall will be required to detect 120 adenomas. Given the uncertainty of our
      estimation and in order to cope with patients exclusions, withdrawals and unexpected
      incomplete colonoscopies, we decided to recruit 200 patients.
