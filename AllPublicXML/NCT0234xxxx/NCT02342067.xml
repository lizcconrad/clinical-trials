    <textblock>
      A single center, open-label, fixed sequence study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      Cenicriviroc (CVC) administered with and without Pioglitazone (PGZ), and to evaluate the PK
      of PGZ administered with and without CVC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, fixed-sequence, 3-period study being conducted in a single center to
      evaluate the following:

        -  PK of CVC administered with and without PGZ

        -  PK of PGZ administered with and without CVC

        -  Safety of CVC administered with and without PGZ

        -  Tolerability of CVC administered with and without PGZ
