  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending dose
      of CNTO 7160 administered intravenously (IV) in healthy participants and multiple dose
      administered IV in participants with asthma and atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of CNTO 7160. The study
      consists of Screening Period, In-patient period (6 days for healthy participants, 11 days for
      asthmatic participants and atopic dermatitis participants) and outpatient period (105 days
      for healthy participants, 110 days for asthmatic and atopic dermatitis participants). The
      total duration of participation for each participant will be approximately 21 weeks for
      healthy participants, 25 weeks for asthmatic participants, and atopic dermatitis
      participants. All eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive active agent or
      placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, single ascending doses of CNTO
      7160 or placebo will be administered to sequential cohorts of healthy participants as an IV
      infusion. In Part 2, ascending multiple doses of CNTO 7160 or placebo will be administered as
      IV infusions to sequential cohorts of participants with asthma or atopic dermatitis. Blood
      samples will be collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters
      in both part 1 and 2 parameters, along with assessment of safety and clinical effects in part
      2. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
