  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can have significant
      physiological abnormalities and breathing inefficiency which become more pronounced during
      the stress of exercise, leading to intolerable breathing discomfort (dyspnea). To better
      understand the mechanisms of respiratory symptoms and exercise limitation in mild COPD, we
      will examine detailed lung function tests and other important measurements during rest and
      exercise in people with mild COPD compared with healthy non-smokers. This will be the first
      study to uncover the fundamental causes of breathing inefficiency and the related shortness
      of breath during physical exertion in patients with mild COPD. We hope to demonstrate that
      one simple measurement during exercise [the relation (ratio) between the total amount of air
      breathed (ventilation) and the amount of carbon dioxide breathed out] gives meaningful
      information about the extent of damage to the small airways and blood vessels in mild COPD
      and the overall gas exchanging function of the lungs, without the need for an arterial blood
      sample.

      This is a case-controlled observational study not involving an intervention. Participants
      will complete 2 visits approximately 1 week apart, each conducted at the same time of day.
      Visit 1 will consiste of screening for iligibility, symptom and activity assessments,
      pulmonary function tests and an incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) for
      familiarization purposes. Visit 2 will include spirometry followed by an incremental cycle
      CPET with detailed measures of ventilatory, gas exchange, sensory-perceptual and arterial
      blood gas responses.
