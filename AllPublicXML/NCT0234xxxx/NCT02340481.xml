  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined loperamide
      hydrochloride and simethicone compared to loperamide hydrochloride monotherapy in treating
      acute diarrhea associated with abdominal discomfort caused by gastrointestinal gas
      accumulation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time), multi-center (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study. All eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a combination of loperamide
      hydrochloride and simethicone or loperamide hydrochloride. The study includes Screening Visit
      (from -24 to 0 hours), Baseline Visit (at 0 hour) and Concluding Visit (within 48 to 96 hours
      following the start of the trial). The timing of each bowel movement, stool characteristics
      and the degree and duration of abdominal discomfort caused by gastrointestinal gas
      accumulation will be recorded for each participant for 48 hours after the first trial drug
      administration. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The TTLUS is defined as the number of hours from the time the participant first took the trial drug to the last instance of unformed stool, after which the participant only reported formed stool or no stool at all. If no unformed stool was observed at any time during the trial, TTLUS shall be recorded as 0. For participants who withdraw from the trial due to reasons other than complete resolution of the symptoms of diarrhea, TTLUS is defined as the number of hours from the start of the trial to the time of withdrawal.</description>

    <description>Each participant will evaluate any abdominal bloating and/or abdominal pain and/or any other type of abdominal discomfort caused by gastrointestinal gas accumulation occurring within the last hour on a 5-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = relatively severe, 4 = severe).</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
