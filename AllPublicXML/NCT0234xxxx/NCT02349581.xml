    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the pectoral nerves block (PECS) in patients with persistent pain
      after breast cancer surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is in 2 parts: Part 1 is a description of the anatomy of the PECS block in pain
      free, unoperated patients using ultrasonography (non invasive). Part 2 is the administration
      of the block to patients that have persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. Before and
      after the block we will take a detailed pain history and do neurophysiological tests called
      quantitative sensory testing (QST). These tests assess the patients' ability to feel warmth,
      cold and test their thresholds for pain. The block is then administered using ultrasound
      guidance and 20mls of 0.25% bupivacaine is injected in the pectoral muscles on the side with
      pain. Thirty minutes after the block, the pain is re assessed and the QST is repeated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in summed pain intensity score (SPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after blockade</time_frame>
    <description>SPI is a combination of pain at rest + pain on arm abduction + pain with 100kPa pressure. SPI will be taken before and 30 minutes after the PECS block</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in quantitative sensory testing (QST) values</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after blockade</time_frame>
    <description>QST consists of sensory mapping (delineating areas of hypo/hyperesthesia and/or allodynia), warm detection thresholds, cool detection thresholds, heat pain thresholds, suprathermal heat pain response and pressure pain thresholds. These will be measured before and 30 minutes after the PECS block</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Longer term effects (Daily pain scores and functional questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after blockade</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete a pain diary for 5 consecutive days before administration of the PECS block and 7 consecutive days after the block. The patients also complete a functional questionnaire the day before the block and again exactly one week after the block.</description>
