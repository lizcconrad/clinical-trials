  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects good and/or bad of combining
      radiofrequency ablation with placement of a second stent, versus a second stent alone. The
      investigators will also look at the safety of the combination treatment, and see which
      treatment is better. In either case, the second stent will be placed inside the existing
      stent as is done in standard practice when treating a blocked stent for the first time.

    <description>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) is performed under standard conditions with cannulation of the bile duct, and demonstration on a cholangiogram the location, diameter and length of the biliary stricture. The HabibTM EndoHBP probe (EMcision, London, United Kingdom) is advanced through the working channel of a side viewing endoscope over a 0.035in guidewire, and positioned across the occluded SEMS under fluoroscopy. 7-10W are usually delivered for 90 seconds with a standard high frequency generator, followed by a 1 minute resting period. Sequential applications of RFA are applied along the entire length of the stricture with an overlap of 1cm.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any tumor obstructing the distal bile duct and causing an indwelling
             biliary SEMS

          -  Patients with jaundice or clinical cholangitis, with new elevation of alkaline
             phosphatase, total bilirubin, and imaging findings supportive of stent occlusion (loss
             of stent patency, debris within stent, loss of or excessive pneumobilia)

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have altered gastro-duodenal or hepatobiliary anatomy such that ERCP is felt to be
             unacceptably technically difficult or unsafe

          -  Have additional sites of biliary strictures (intrahepatic/hilar) such that ERCP
             stenting is felt to be unlikely to provide adequate clinical benefit

          -  Have cardiac pacemakers

          -  Have Child B/C cirrhosis

          -  Are pregnant

          -  Are unsuitable for endoscopy (either because of hemodynamic instability, respiratory
             distress or unsafe hematological parameters such as refractory anemia &lt;7g/dL,
             thrombocytopenia &lt;50K/mcL, or coagulopathy with INR &gt;2.0)

          -  Have biliary strictures not technically amenable to endoscopic therapy
