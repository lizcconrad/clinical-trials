      The Cognition Intervention Study Dortmund (CogniDo) and the Cognition Intervention Study
      Dortmund PLUS (CogniDo PLUS) investigated the short-term effects of having school lunch
      versus skipping it on children's basal (CogniDo) and executive (CogniDo PLUS) cognitive
      functions in the afternoon. The present Coco study connect this two previous studies and
      investigates the effect of having school lunch versus skipping it on children's basal and
      executive cognitive functions later in the afternoon.

    <textblock>
      Because of cerebral particularities, children may react highly sensitive to variations of
      nutrient supply. Therefore, an optimised composition of meals at favourable mealtime should
      be considered for optimal cognitive performance. The increasing implementation of all-day
      schools in Germany requires the children's catering for lunch at school. However, the number
      of 'meal skippers' is increasing among children and adolescents. Thus, the effect of skipping
      lunch at school on cognitive functioning is examined in this experimental cross-over trial.
      As prior intake of food can have an influence on the physiological effect of test meal, the
      children's dietary intake in the mid-morning is standardized. The intervention is integrated
      in everyday school life:

      9.15 a.m. standardized snack within the frame of the regular break, 9.45 a.m. to 12.25 p.m.
      everyday school life, 12.25 p.m. either lunch (control) or water as a beverage (intervention
      of 'skipping meal'), 12.45 p.m. to 1.15 p.m. regular lunch break, 1.15 p.m. to 14.10 p.m.
      regular school lesson. 14.15 p.m. computerized tests of executive cognitive and basal
      (alertness) functioning, 3 p.m. lunch for the 'skipping meal'-group. Parameters of cognition
      with relevance to everyday school life are measured by a computerized test program developed
      by the Institute of Working Learning and Aging (ALA). Usual eating behaviour, sleep
      behaviour, physical activity and parental education were determined as control variables by
      questionnaires for children, parents.
