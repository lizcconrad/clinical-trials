  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and young people with epilepsy are at increased risk of poorer outcomes related to
      emotional and psychological adjustment, peer relationship problems, lower academic attainment
      and mental health problems across the lifespan. Despite the well understood risks, there
      continues to be a lack of psychological and psychosocial support for young people with
      epilepsy, and a corresponding lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial
      interventions. This study aims to evaluate a manualised psychosocial group intervention for
      adolescents with epilepsy. A cognitive behaviour therapy approach is used, aimed at
      increasing awareness of how epilepsy may impact upon thoughts, feelings and activities and to
      develop strategies for improved psychological adjustment. In addition, an epilepsy knowledge
      component aimed at improving a sense of control and epilepsy self-management is included. A
      group delivery format allows an opportunity for social modelling, and social problem solving,
      helping others and relating to other young people with similar experiences. The social
      learning context and availability of knowledgable facilitators (an epilepsy nurse specialist
      and clinical psychologist) are also key aspects of the intervention. The study will allow us
      to establish a standard manualised group intervention that can be used throughout the UK
      which aims to余 establish the effectiveness and desirability of this approach余 improve the
      overall quality of life, psychological health and social integration of young people with
      epilepsy余 and to improve epilepsy knowledge and selfmanagement skills aimed at maximising
      seizure control and overall management.
