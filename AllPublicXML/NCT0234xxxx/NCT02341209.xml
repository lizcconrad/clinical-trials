      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline in relapsed Cutaneous T-cell
      Lymphomas (CTCL). The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate of
      doxycycline monotherapy in patients with relapsed CTCL.

          -  Measurable disease in at least one target lesion in the skin or able to be assessed by
             radiographic examination with FDG-PET fluorodeoxyglucose possitron emission tomography
             (FDG-PET) scan or computarized tomography (CT) scan, or peripheral blood showing
             involvement of lymphoma.

          -  The subject has resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior cancer
             therapy to Grade ≤1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v.4.0) excluding the specification below.

          -  Adequate organ function:

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt; 500 cells/mL and platelet count &gt; 50,000 cells/mL
             unless felt to be secondary to lymphoma at which any count is permissible.

          -  Adequate renal function as determined by creatinine &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal (ULN) or
             estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60ml/min

          -  Adequate hepatic function as determined by total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN (unless known
             Gilbert syndrome), Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 2.5x
             ULN

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CTCL.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days of receiving study medication and monthly while on receiving doxycycline

             abstinence from sexual intercourse (periodic abstinence, e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
