      The purpose of this study is to determine whether extra fine formoterol/beclomethasona are
      more effective in the treatment of asthmatic crisis when added to conventional treatment
      compared with conventional treatment alone.

      Inhaled corticosteroids still the cornerstone in treatment of stable asthma, while
      bronchodilators and systemic steroids are in asthmatic crisis.

      Asthmatic exacerbations are events occurring in the natural course of the disease, require a
      change in actual medication and they are associated with risks of complications producing
      important economic costs.

      Some is known about non-genomic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, making possible, at least
      in theory, having a positive effect on treatment of a crisis. On the other hand, formoterol
      has been shown to have a rapid beginning of action (3 minutes), persisting its effect during
      12 hours and it has been shown to be as effective as albuterol in the treatment of a crisis.

      The development of extra-fine particles has allowed reaching more distal zones in the lungs
      producing more deposition of the drug, which as well decrease adverse effects are lesser
      doses of the drug are needed.

      According to that, aims of this work is to determine whether extra-fine
      formoterol/beclomethasona are more effective in the treatment of asthmatic crisis when added
      to conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment in terms of pulmonary
      function, symptoms, inflammation markers and rates of hospitalization.
