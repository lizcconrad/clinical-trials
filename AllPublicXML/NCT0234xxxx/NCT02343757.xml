  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early detection of a preclinical AD or early stage of AD with amyloid imaging could
      improve the diagnosis and provide knowledge for better therapeutical approach by combining
      the best of imaging: structural MR sequences and newly FDA-approved biomarker for amyloid PET
      imaging, all these two techniques with their strengths in one machine.

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses can be summarized as follows:

        1. To assess image quality and diagnostic performance of 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) PET/MRI,
           including direct comparison to corresponding PET/CT images of the same patients.

        2. To evaluate the incremental value of using 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in addition to
           2-[F-18]-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) versus FDG alone. Does quantification of plaque
           burden correlate with degree of neuronal degeneration as depicted by FDG as well as with
           clinical severity?

        3. To determine plaque burden quantitatively with 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in PET (form
           PET/CT and from PET/MR) using novel software developed specifically for these brain
           application; Computer-Aid Diagnosis for Dementia for amyloid imaging - CAD4D-amyloid

    <description>The main effect that will be evaluated in this study is the ability of 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) PET/MRI to assess the diagnosis of a patient, compared to both PET/CT and the diagnosis from the clinical record. Another effect that will be evaluated is if there is an added value when using 18F-florbetapir (AMYVID) in addition to 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) versus using only FDG in the evaluation of cognitive impairment patients.</description>

    <description>Patients will be included if presenting with the clinical suspicious of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or other cognitive impairment to be further determined.
Patients will undergo two doubles scans in two steps with a maximum of 2 week between both: the first step will be one day double scan with FDG imaged by PET-CT and PET-MRI; and the second step will be one day double scan with 18F-florbetapir imaged by PET-CT and PET-MRI at a different timepoints as shown in figure 1.</description>
