      This study plans to learn more about the brain function related to thinking problems in
      individuals with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet
      little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective
      treatments. The investigators preliminary data and other published studies suggest that
      abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory
      may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This
      proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in
      PD using magnetoencephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of bifrontal
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of
      modulating this brain activity.

    <description>TMS will be administered using a 70-mm diameter air-cooled figure-of-8 coil and SuperRapid2 Magstim Stimulator. Repetitive pulses will be delivered to the right and left pre-frontal cortex (Brodmann area 46) using a frameless stereotactic navigation system and the subject's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Brainsight software. Stimuli will be delivered at 20 Hz at 90% resting motor threshold (rMT) for 25 trains of 30 pulses per train, inter-train interval of 30 seconds for a total of 750 pulses per hemisphere. This dose and duration of repetitive TMS (rTMS) is based on physiological studies of healthy adults and treatment studies of cognition in PD and Alzheimer's disease.52, 123 Side of first stimulation (left vs right hemisphere) will be counterbalanced across subjects.</description>
