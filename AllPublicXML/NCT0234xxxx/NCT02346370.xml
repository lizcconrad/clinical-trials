    <textblock>
      A Phase 1b study for subjects with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to participate in 1 of 2 portions of
      this study. The first portion is Dose Escalation in which subjects are tested with PEGPH20 at
      various doses (1.6, 3.0, 2.2 and 2.8 mcg/kg) in addition to dosing with the standard dose of
      docetaxel of 75 mg/m2 (PDoc) once every 21-day cycle. Based on observations on the safety and
      tolerability of study treatment from dose escalation cohorts dosed to date (1.6 and 3.0
      mcg/kg of PEGPH20), two additional dose levels will be tested, 2.2 and 2.8 mcg/kg. Up to 30
      additional subjects may be enrolled to test these dose levels. The second portion of Phase 1b
      is Cohort Expansion in which the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PDoc identified in dose
      escalation is administered every 21 days to approximately 50 subjects with high hyaluronan
      (HA-high) prospectively measured in their tumor tissue.

      This is a Phase 1b study for subjects with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to participate in 1 of 2
      portions of this study. The first portion of the Phase 1b is Dose Escalation which will
      enroll up to 30 subjects testing various dose levels of PEGPH20 (1.6, 2.2, 2.8 and 3.0
      mcg/kg) plus docetaxel 75mg/m2 once every 3 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose or MTD is
      found. Based on observations on the safety and tolerability of study treatment from dose
      escalation cohorts dosed to date (1.6 and 3.0 mcg/kg of PEGPH20), two additional dose levels,
      2.2 and 2.8 mcg/kg will be tested. The 2nd portion of Phase 1b is Cohort Expansion. This
      portion will enroll approximately 50 subjects at the MTD/RP2D of PDoc given every 21-day
      cycle. These subjects will be pre-selected with high levels of HA measured in their tumor
      tissue sample prior to enrollment. After the Phase 1b is completed, all data will be analyzed
      and the safest, best tolerated and most efficacious dose of PDoc will be used in a planned
      separate Phase 2 study.
