  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to quantitatively assess the average amount of physical activity
      that patients are capable to perform while receiving regorafenib for the treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer. The assessment of this reference value, measured by CE
      (Conformité Européene)-certified pedometer and international physical activity questionnaire,
      will allow an estimation on the feasible amount of physical activity for patients in this
      therapeutic setting.

      This study is available for patients who are included in the global non-interventional study
      CORRELATE (Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer patients;
      NCT01843400) in Austria.

    <description>The non influenced and non triggered habitual physical activity of patients will be assessed by pedometer and physical activity questionnaire. The study population will consist of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) who are included in the NIS CORRELATE, have been previously treated with other approved regimens for metastatic disease and for whom a decision has been made by the physician to treat with regorafenib according to local health authority approved label prior to and independent of the inclusion into this observational study.</description>

    <description>Stivarga is available as tablets (40 mg). It is taken in four-week treatment cycles at a recommended starting dose of 160 mg once every day for three weeks, followed by a week off.</description>
