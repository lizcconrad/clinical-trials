      Primary Objective:

      To compare the clinical efficacy of gemigliptin and vildagliptin as add-on therapy to
      metformin in terms of change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the safety and tolerability of gemigliptin and vildagliptin:

        -  Number of patients who experience at least one episode of hypoglycemia.

        -  Number of patients experiencing adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE).

        -  Assessment of patients compliance defined as number tablets returned by patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 weeks screening and 24 weeks of treatment (a total of 26 weeks).

      The protocol includes a screening period of two weeks, after which they will be randomized to
      receive gemigliptin or vildagliptin.

      Patients will be evaluated through 4 mandatory visits during the study. Visit 1: Week -2
      (screening) Visit 2: Week 0 (randomization) Visit 3: Week 12 (efficacy and safety evaluation)
      Visit 4: Week 24 (efficacy and safety evaluation)
