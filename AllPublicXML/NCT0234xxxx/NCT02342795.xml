    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) methods to examine the
      influence of novel tobacco products on biomarkers of toxicant exposure and disease risk,
      reports of adverse events, and concurrent use of other tobacco products. In this case, the
      novel products are one type of electronic cigarette and an imitation cigarette or cigarette
      substitute.

    <description>The QuitSmart cigarette substitute is a plastic tube that looks like a real cigarette and is designed to provide the same draw resistance as a smoker's usual cigarette. There is no drug delivery with this product. Two cigarette substitutes and a product manual are provided to participants following randomization and replacement products are provided throughout the intervention period (24 weeks).</description>
