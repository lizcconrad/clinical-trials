  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diacutaneous Fibrolysis (DF) is a manual method of treatment, usually adjuvant, addressed to
      the mechanical pain of the locomotor system. In our clinical practice a favorable effect is
      observed in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, but there are no published studies
      evaluating the results of this technique.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if DF provides a further improvement in pain
      intensity, pain-pressure threshold, function and pain-free grip strength, in patients with
      chronic lateral epicondylitis being treated with physiotherapy. For this purpose, we conduct
      a randomized controlled trial, double-blind (patient and evaluator) in a Public Primary Care
      Center.

      Sixty subjects will be randomized (computer application) into three groups: Intervention
      Group, Placebo Group and Control Group. All the three groups receive the same protocolized
      treatment of physiotherapy and additionally. Additionally, the Intervention Group receives
      six sessions (two sessions in a week during three weeks) of real DF and the Placebo Group
      receives six sessions (two sessions in a week during three weeks) of sham DF. The Control
      Group receives the protocolized treatment of physiotherapy only.

      Pain intensity (VAS), pain-pressure threshold (pressure algometry), function (DASH
      questionnaire) and pain-free grip strength (digital dynamometer) will be measured at
      baseline, after treatment period, and three months after discharge from treatment. After
      discharge for treatment the patient subjective opinion about their evolution will be
      collected through the Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale.

    <description>Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is a non-invasive physiotherapeutic technique applied by means of a set of metallic hooks ending in a spatula with bevelled edges that allow a deeper and more precise application, which could not be achieved manually. The hook is deeply applied following the intermuscular septum between the muscles with an anatomical of functional relationship with the painful structure in order to release adherences between musculoskeletal structures.</description>
