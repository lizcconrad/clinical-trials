        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is able to provide written informed consent before initiation of any
             study-related procedures.

          2. Subject is a healthy male or female adult between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 45 kg/m2.

          4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings.

          5. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing
             potential, agrees to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g.
             prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,
             intrauterine device, barrier methods, abstinence) or male partner sterilization alone
             for the duration of the study until 60 days after study drug administration.

          6. Subject agrees to abstain from caffeine and theobromine containing products and the
             consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit (including grapefruit juice), broccoli,
             brussel sprouts, charcoal grilled meat, and energy drinks from 48 hours before study
             drug administration and throughout the clinical phase of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any condition, including findings in the medical history or in pre-study
             assessments that constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the participation in the
             study or completing the study.

             Screening.

          3. Has a history or presence of alcohol/drug abuse within 2 years. Alcohol abuse is
             defined as regularly consuming &gt;3 units/day (21 units per week for men), &gt;2 units/day
             (14 drinks/week) for women. 1 unit of alcohol is defined as a can of 4% beer (330 mL),
             approximately 190 mL of 6-7% beer (malt liquor), a glass of 40% spirits (30 mL), or a
             glass of wine (100 mL).

          4. Blood or plasma donation within past 2 months.

          5. History of hypersensitivity to glycopeptide antibiotics (that have a similar chemical
             structure to oritavancin) or to any of the excipients of oritavancin.

          6. History of hypersensitivity to warfarin or other 4-hydroxycoumarins, or to any of the
             excipients of warfarin.

          7. Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other
             investigational drugs or devices within 90 days prior to enrollment and/or unwilling
             to allow at least two months before participation in another drug trial following the
             current trial.

          8. Treatment with any prescription or OTC (over the counter) drugs or herbal nutritional
             supplements within 2 weeks of Screening, with the exception of
             acetaminophen/paracetamol for minor headache. Subjects will not be allowed to receive
             medications for the duration of the study (except the above mentioned
             acetaminophen/paracetamol). Birth control or other hormone replacement is also
             permitted as long as it has been taken at a stable dose for at least three months
             before the Screening Visit and remains stable for the duration of the study.

          9. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result at
             screening.

         10. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth.

             control during the entire study period (i.e. condom with spermicide)

         11. Known protein C or protein S deficiency.

         12. Inflammatory Bowel Disease or conditions which may decrease the absorption of
             warfarin.

         13. History of bleeding tendencies (e.g history of menorrhagia, gastrointestinal
             bleeding).

         14. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

         15. Surgery within the last 30 days.
