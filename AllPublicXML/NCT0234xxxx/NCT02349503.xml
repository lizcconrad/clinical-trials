  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of NBI-77860 in subjects with
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The study will be conducted in approximately 15
      adolescent females (12-18 years of age) with a documented medical diagnosis of classic
      21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH. The study will include three independent dose cohorts of
      NBI-77860 (approximately 5 subjects per dose cohort). Ascending doses will be evaluated as
      part of a sequential-cohort design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have documentation of written informed consent, or written and witnessed assent from

          2. Be in good general health.

          3. Have a medically confirmed diagnosis of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH.

          4. Be on a stable regimen of steroidal treatment for CAH for a minimum of 30 days before
             baseline (Night 1) that is expected to remain stable throughout the study.

             classic CAH.

          4. Have a history that includes bilateral adrenalectomy, hypopituitarism, or other
             condition requiring daily therapy with orally administered glucocorticoids.

          5. Pregnant or lactating females.

          6. Have a history of epilepsy or serious head injury.

          7. Test positive at screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV), or have a history of a positive result.

          8. Have a recent history (≤1 year) of alcohol or drug abuse, or current evidence of
             substance dependence or abuse criteria.

          9. Used any other investigational drug within 30 days before initial screening, or plans

         10. Have a blood loss ≥250 mL or donated blood within 56 days or donated plasma within 7
             days before baseline.
