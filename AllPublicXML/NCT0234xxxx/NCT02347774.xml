      This is a trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an Investigational
      eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014)
      guidelines.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,
      efficacy and safety trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an
      Investigational eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in approximately 645 subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014) guidelines.

      SUN-101 or placebo will be administered twice daily as an oral inhalation using the
      investigational eFlow CS nebulizer.

    <time_frame>baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>All collected Participants reported change in health status by using the SGRQ. The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD: symptoms, activity, and impacts. A score was calculated for each of these 3 subscales and a &quot;Total&quot; score was calculated. In each case the lowest possible value is 0 and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment of health status.

        <description>On-treatment Spirometry was performed according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 at Week 12 was defined as the mean of the values collected at two time points 30 minutes apart at approximately 24 hours (± 1 hour) after the previous morning dose.
Only on-treatment values (which included only data collected while subjects were taking study drug) are used for this analysis. Values affected by other medication use were set to missing. Non-collected or missing data were not imputed for this analysis. Values not collected remained as missing values and were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).</description>

The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD: symptoms, activity, and impacts. A score was calculated for each of these 3 subscales and a &quot;Total&quot; score was calculated. In each case the lowest possible value is 0 and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment of health status.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Status Measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Week 12/End of Study</title>
        <description>On-treatment Participants reported change in health status by using the SGRQ. The SGRQ contains 50 items divided into 2 parts covering 3 aspects of health related to COPD: symptoms, activity, and impacts. A score was calculated for each of these 3 subscales and a &quot;Total&quot; score was calculated. In each case the lowest possible value is 0 and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment of health status.
Only on-treatment values (which included only data collected while subjects were taking study drug) are used for this analysis. Values affected by other medication use were set to missing. Non-collected or missing data were not imputed for this analysis. Values not collected remained as missing values and were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).</description>

        <description>All deaths and any other findings suggestive of a potential MACE (including clinically relevant information and SAEs, and all PTs form the SMQs “myocardial infarction”, “other ischemic heart disease”, “central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions”) were sent to an adjudication committee for review and categorized as CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. The MACE score was defined as the total number of subjects with CV deaths, nonfatal MIs, and nonfatal strokes. These events were collected for the double-blind period (from the first date of study medication until the date of last contact)
Incidence rate: TT= Total Time in years. Total Time (TT) is defined as the time from the first date of study drug until the latter of the date of last contact or 30 days after the date of last dose. Incidence Rate (per 1000 person-years) = n/TT x 1000.</description>
