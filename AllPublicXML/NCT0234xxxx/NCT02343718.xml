      The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of vinblastine that can be given with
      a new drug, temsirolimus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vinblastine is already approved in the treatment of some types of cancer in children and
      temsirolimus is already used to treat some adult cancers in Canada. Temsirolimus has been
      shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals but it is not known if it can also slow tumour
      growth in children. Laboratory studies suggest that giving both vinblastine and temsirolimus
      may offer better results than giving vinblastine alone.
