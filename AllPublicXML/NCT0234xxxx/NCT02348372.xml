  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI115385, will be the first
      administration of GSK1278863A to Japanese subjects to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses in healthy Japanese adult
      subjects. Healthy Caucasian adult subjects will be included in order to compare
      pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863A and its metabolite(s), and pharmacodynamics of GSK1278863A.

             and compromise subject safety.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
