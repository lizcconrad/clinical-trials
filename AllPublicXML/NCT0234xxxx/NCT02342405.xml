  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of preoperative cardiac ischemia and the 30-days postoperative mortality is
      much higher than previously assumed, with approximately 10 % of patients undergoing
      non-cardiac surgery suffering from postoperative myocardial injury. A recent danish study
      furthermore showed that patients treated with a high inspiratory oxygen fraction during
      surgery had a higher 1 year mortality compared with patients treated with a low inspiratory
      fraction. This was especially significant among patients undergoing cancer surgery. A
      possible explanation, is that a high oxygen fraction results in oxidative stress and
      endothelial dysfunction.

      With this randomized cross-over study we wish to investigate the effect of a high inspiratory
      oxygen fraction on the endothelial function among healthy male volunteers. The primary
      outcome is the endothelial function assessed by the EndoPat system. Secondary outcomes are
      changes in oxidative biomarkers. Heart rate variability (HRV) recordings will serve as a
      measure for the effect of oxygen on the autonomic nervous system.
