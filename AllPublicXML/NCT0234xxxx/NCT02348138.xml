      The main purpose this study is to analyze the effects of isometric handgrip training on
      cardiovascular risk in hypertensive. For this, approximately 60 hypertensive, under
      anti-hypertensive medication, will be selected and randomly distributed into three groups:
      home-based isometric handgrip training (HBT), supervised isometric handgrip training (ST) and
      control group (CG).Subjects assigned to the HBT and ST will train three times per week for a
      total of 12 weeks, will perform a bout of isometric handgrip exercise: four sets of 2-min
      isometric contractions (using alternate hands) at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction.
      However, the subjects of the HBT group conduct the training without daily supervision.
      Subjects randomized to the CG will be encouraged to increase the level of physical activity
      and make healthy eating, without, however, receive specific recommendations.Baseline and
      after 12 weeks of intervention, the following cardiovascular risk indicators will be
      obtained: blood pressure, arterial stiffness, cardiac autonomic modulation, vasodilatory
      capacity and oxidative and inflammatory stress markers, in addition to microalbuminuria. For
      data analysis, in addition to descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA for mixed model will be
      applied for within and between groups comparison. If the premises of this test are met. The
      level of significance that will be adopted is p&lt;0.05.

Therefore, the subjects will receive a logbook to record the exercise sessions. In addition, visits will be scheduled at weeks 1, 3, 6, 9 and 11 to provide feedback to individuals and discuss potential problems in conducting training.</description>
