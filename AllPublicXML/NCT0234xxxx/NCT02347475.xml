    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure the changes induced by packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion in
      the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow velocity and intestinal oxygenation indices in
      premature neonates. These changes will be measured in relation to feeding, before and after a
      blood transfusion. Overall reduction of intestinal perfusion is a risk factor for necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC) - a condition with significant mortality and long term morbidity.
      Identifying specific patterns of flow velocity and tissue oxygenation changes will allow for
      planning, studying and implementing risk avoidance and minimization strategies.

      Hypothesis: In preterm neonates the anticipated physiologic post-prandial increase in each
      SMA flow and intestinal perfusion is blunted post transfusion. This is worse in SGA infants
      and/or in the presence of a PDA.

      Questions: 1) Does PRBC transfusion alter postprandial SMA flow increases and intestinal
      oxygenation indices in preterm infants receiving enteral feeds? 2) Is there a difference in
      postprandial SMA flow and intestinal perfusion changes in recently transfused SGA infants
      compared to AGA infants, and in those with and without a PDA? Primary Outcome: Post-prandial
      SMA flows changes before and after PRBC transfusion.

      Secondary outcomes: Pre-post prandial changes in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-measured
      intestinal oxygenation parameters before and after PRBC transfusion.
