  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to improve the fit and function of prosthetic sockets for above
      the knee amputees through the use of an outpatient thigh reduction surgical procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will quantify the anatomical distribution of subcutaneous fat, muscle and bone in the
      residual limb of the transfemoral amputees with an MRI. We will measure the displacement of
      the socket wall relative to the femur under mechanical loading with x-ray. The functional
      mobility level of the subject with be quantified via standard clinical and bio mechanical
      tests. Perform a standard medial thighplasty with our without thigh liposuction. Characterize
      the post-surgical anatomy, compliance of the residual limb and function of the amputee
      subjects. After six months, repeat the MRI and xray and compare results. Subject will also
      complete a questionnaire regarding their views on the outcome of the surgery.

    <measure>Assess compliance of residual limb in the socket, which will improve the fit and comfort of the prosthesis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre surgery and 6 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the compliance of their residual limb by the displacement of the socket wall relative to the femur under mechanical loading with X-ray. The subjects will adjust their foot placement, limb loading and muscle contractions to achieve up to 8 specified force/torque levels (as measured by a 6 degree-of-freedom load cell located in series with their pylon and socket), which correspond to forces and torques that are typical of over ground walking and standing postures and are scaled for their body weight. For each force/torque level, static X-ray scans of locations of the prosthetic socket wall and residual limb femur will be acquired.</description>

    <intervention_name>Medial thighplasty with or without thigh liposuction</intervention_name>
    <description>Perform a standard medial thighplasty with or without additional thigh liposuction on up to three obese transfemoral amputee subjects. The subjects will be transfemoral amputees who are successful ambulators and have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater with excessive adipose tissue in their residual limb. The surgery will consist of medial excision of excess adipose and cutaneous tissue with circumferential liposuction.</description>
