  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an ageing population, the need for interventions to help older people remain healthy,
      active and independent for as long as possible, increases. Although several studies suggest a
      beneficial effect of vitamin D3 on maintaining or improving muscle strength and physical
      functioning, particularly in vulnerable populations, results are contradicting. Randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials are needed to further establish the effect of vitamin D on muscle
      strength in the frail elderly population.The primary aim of this study is to determine the
      effect of daily supplementation with two different forms of vitamin D on muscle strength in
      frail elderly people over a period of 24 weeks.
