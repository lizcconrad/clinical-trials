      The investigators compared the postoperative analgesia of nerve stimulator-guided and
      ultrasound-guided interscalene block after shoulder surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral nerve block has increased in popularity. It has many
      advantages such as improved success rate, faster onset time, fewer needle passes, shorter
      performance time, and reduced procedural pain and vascular puncture. However, there is no
      information about postoperative analgesia.

      Therefore, the investigators tested whether nerve stimulator (NS) - guided interscalene block
      was inferior to ultrasound-guided block in terms of duration of postoperative analgesia for
      shoulder surgery.

    <description>Patients received a standard single injection interscalene block using the modified lateral approach of Borgeat. The interscalene brachial plexus was identified using an insulated needle connected to a nerve stimulator. An insulated needle attached to a nerve stimulator was used to identify the brachial plexus. Placement of the needle was considered adequate if the deltoid, triceps, pectoralis, or biceps muscle motor response was still present at 0.2 - 0.5mA. Ropivacine 0.75% 20ml was used.</description>

    <description>Interscalene block is performed under ultrasound guidance. Linear probe is placed on the ipsilateral interscalene groove visualizing the brachial plexus located between anterior and middle scalene muscles. Using in-plane technique, an insulated needle is advanced into the brachial plexus sheath, into which 20 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine is injected</description>
