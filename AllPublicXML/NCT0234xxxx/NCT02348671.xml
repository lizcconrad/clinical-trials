    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if wound dressings are capable in reducing the
      effects of shear- force at the skin. With our own shear- force model we are able to apply 19
      Newton shear- force combined with 9 newton pressure at the skin of the non- dominant forearm.
      After half an hour we measure IL-1alpha/ total protein- ratio, cutaneous blood flow (Laser
      doppler, Moor LDI) and the erythema index (DSMIIColormeter) which occurs as an effect of
      shear- force application at the skin.

      Then, we apply 19 Newton shear- force combined with 9 Newton pressure at the dominant
      fore-arm but this time we put a wound dressing between the skin and shear- force model. After
      half an hour we measure the IL-1alpha/total protein-ratio, cutaneous blood flow and the
      erythema index.

      This research consists of three research day, each day we are going to investigate a
      different wound dressing
