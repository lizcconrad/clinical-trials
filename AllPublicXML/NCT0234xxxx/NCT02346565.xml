  <brief_title>Stress Echocardiography Versus Exercise ECG (ExECG) in Women With Chest Pain</brief_title>
  <official_title>The Role of Contemporary Stress Echocardiography Techniques in the Initial Assessment of Women With No Previous History of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Who Present With Chest Pain of Recent Onset. Stress Echocardiography vs Exercise ECG as First Line Investigation in This Population. Potential for Higher Diagnostic Accuracy Cost Saving.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall question the investigators would like to help answer is whether SE with or
      without MCE data can be widely used as a first line investigation in women with no previous
      history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) who present with chest pain of recent onset. In
      order to answer this question the investigators will look at the following:

      i) Is SE superior to ExECG in terms of cost to diagnosis and negative predictive value of
      CAD?

      ii) What is the additive value of myocardial perfusion data to wall motion data for
      predicting significant CAD on angiography and future cardiac events in women?

      iii) What is the additive value of Carotid ultrasonography in a large population of women
      referred for stress testing?

      The investigators plan to perform a prospective study on all women seen in our RACPC with no
      previous history of CAD and intermediate pre-test probability of CAD as determined by
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, who require a functional
      test as part of their assessment. All patients that meet the inclusion criteria and do not
      meet any of the exclusion criteria will be approached for consent to the study.

      Patients who can perform greater than 5 metabolic equivalents (METS) on the Duke Activity
      Status Index (DASI) questionaire will be randomised between undergoing an Exercise ECG
      (Ex-ECG) or Exercise Stress Echo (ESE). The DASI is a 12-item questionnaire that estimates
      self-reported physical work capacity and is converted to an estimate of peak metabolic
      equivalents. Patients who do not meet this criteria, will undergo a pharmacological stress
      echocardiogram using Dobutamine (DSE), including Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE).
      Investigations will continue to be performed as per standard clinical departmental protocols
      as described below. In addition, all patients will undergo carotid ultrasonography. The
      techniques used are described for completeness as they are all well-established in clinical
      practice.

    <description>Patients will undergo an exercise test using the standard Bruce protocol. Standard end points of exercise testing will include: fatigue, severe ischaemia (severe chest pain, &gt;2mm ST depression on ECG), hypertension (systolic BP&gt;220mmHg), hypotension, pre-syncope or arrhythmia.</description>

    <description>A two-dimensional echocardiogram will be performed in the lateral decubitus position. Digitized images of the left ventricle (LV) will be obtained in the parasternal long-axis, short-axis, and apical four-, two-, and three-chamber views.
In the case of exercise stress echo, images will be acquired at rest and immediately (within 90 seconds) after peak exercise.
In the case of dobutamine stress echo, images will be acquired at rest, at the end of stage one of dobutamine administration (10mcg/Kg/min) and at peak stress.</description>
