      The primary aim of the study was to characterize and quantify the histopathological changes
      in the surgical specimens obtained in patients undergoing prostatectomy in addition to
      imaging changes (MRI) following a single injection of Liproca Depot in patients with
      localized prostate cancer.

      imaging changes (MRI) following a single injection of Liproca Depot in patients with

      The secondary aims ere to evaluate efficacy and safety of a single injection of Liproca
      Depot, and to follow the pharmacokinetic profile.
