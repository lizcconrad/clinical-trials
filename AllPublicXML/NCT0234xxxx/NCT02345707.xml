  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two cohorts, 3-way cross-over design
      in 36 subjects to assess the oral bioavailability of four new cabotegravir (CAB) sodium salt
      tablet formulations relative to the current CAB sodium salt formulation being used in the
      phase IIb studies under fasting conditions. All treatments will be administered as single 30
      mg doses of CAB. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each
      treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 10 - 14 days after the last dose of study
      drug. Treatment period doses will be separated by a 14 day washout. Participation in this
      study will be approximately 12 weeks.

             Pre-menopausal females with one of the following [for this definition, &quot;documented&quot;
             refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical
             history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or

             picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomole [pmol]/ liter [L]) is confirmatory]. c) Reproductive
             potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline

             Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication and until after the last dose of study medication and completion of
             the follow-up visit. GSK Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding
             Pregnancy in FRP are as follows. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex
             partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and
             will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and
             persistent basis. a) Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the
             standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of
             failure per year, as stated in the product label. b) Male partner sterilization with
             documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and
             this male is the sole partner for that subject. c) Male condom combined with a vaginal
             spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository) only for the following 3
             situations when there is a very low risk for developmental toxicity: Vaccines;
             Monoclonal antibodies when there is no target biology concern; Compounds that have a
             complete reproductive toxicology package and have not shown any signal for
             developmental toxicity. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when
             used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The
             investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use
             these methods of contraception. Sexual inactivity by abstinence must be consistent
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol.

          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x Upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease including: a) Exclusion
             criteria for screening Electrocardiogram (ECG) (a single repeat is allowed for
             eligibility determination) Heart rate: Males: &lt;45 and &gt;100 beats per minute, Females:
             &lt;50 and &gt;100 beats per minute; QRS duration: &gt;120 millisecond (msec), QTc interval
             (B): &gt;450 msec; b) Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (pathologic Q waves, S-T
             segment changes (except early repolarization). c) History/evidence of symptomatic
             arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or
             percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or any clinically significant
             cardiac disease. d) Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or
             right complete bundle branch block, atrioventricular block (AV) block [2nd degree
             (type II) or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome). e) Sinus pauses &gt;3
             seconds. f) Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor, will interfere with the safety for the
             individual subject. g) Non-sustained (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or
             sustained ventricular tachycardia. NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for
             heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or
             another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific formula that will be
             used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be
             determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different
             formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the
             lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For
             purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite
             of available values of QTc will be used as specified in the Reporting and Analysis
             Plan (RAP).

             of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.
             Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) with negative hepatitis b surface antibody should
             also be excluded.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
