      To compare the number and function of regular T cell of patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) versus that of age-, gender- and BMI (body mass index)-matched controls

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience intermittent hypoxemia and arousal
      during sleep due to recurrent collapse of upper airway. Epidemiologic evidence showed they
      were at higher risk for autoimmune diseases. The regular T cell (Treg) has a crucial role in
      controlling autoimmunity. In this study, 40 OSA patients and 40 age-, gender- and BMI-matched
      controls will be recruited. Peripheral venous blood of the participants is drawn for
      numeration of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regular T cells by flow cytometry. As well, the CD4+CD25+
      regular T cells are enriched by MACS and tested for their suppressive functions on
      proliferation assays. Th12+ CD4+ cells are also measured.

    <description>This study aims to compare the difference in the number and function of regulatory T cells between OSA patients and controls. The investigators will draw peripheral venous blood samples from both groups and measure the number and function of their regulatory T cells. However, some, NOT ALL, of OSA patients may receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment-the standard therapy for severe-to-moderate OSA. Use of CPAP is based on physician's suggestion and patients' decision, but not for this study. The devices are provided by patients themselves and its type/brand is not limited or prespecified. For those with CPAP therapy, their blood sample will be re-collected 26 weeks later to repeat measurement for subgroup analysis.</description>
