  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of an uninterrupted dabigatran
      etexilate periprocedural anticoagulant regimen compared to an uninterrupted warfarin regimen
      in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
      ablation in a PROBE (Prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point) active
      controlled study.

      Secondary objectives are to assess additional safety endpoints and efficacy in this clinical
      setting.

      It is not intended to assess confirmatory hypothesis, this is an exploratory study.

    <measure>Incidence of Major Bleeding Events (MBEs), as Defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)</measure>
    <time_frame>during and up to 2 months post-ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Major bleeds were defined according to the ISTH definition of a major bleed, as follows
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome and/or
Bleeding associated with a reduction in haemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L), or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of blood or packed cells. and/or
Fatal bleed
These are based on adjudicated data (blinded evaluation)
Point estimates for the incidence of ISTH MBEs and their 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI), based on the normal approximation of independent binomial distribution without stratification, are presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of the Composite of Stroke, Systemic Embolism, or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>during and up to 2 months post-ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke was defined as an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of haemorrhage or infarction.
Systemic embolism was defined as an acute vascular occlusion of the extremities or any organ (kidneys, mesenteric arteries, spleen, retina or grafts) and was to be documented by angiography, surgery, scintigraphy or autopsy.
Transient ischemic attack was defined as a transient episode of focal neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.
These are based on adjudicated data (blinded evaluation).
Percentage of patients with composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is presented</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Minor Bleeding Events</measure>
    <time_frame>during and up to 2 months post-ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Minor bleeds were clinical bleeds that did not fulfil the criteria for major bleeds. Percentage of patients with Minor bleeding events are presented.
These are based on adjudicated data (blinded evaluation)</description>
