  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, one in six children in Burkina Faso died before the age of five, mainly due to lack
      of access to quality health care services. Most of these deaths could have been avoided
      through cost-effective interventions. Ensuring that sick children receive adequate care in a
      country where 80% of the population lives in rural areas requires improved accessibility and
      high quality primary health care services. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses
      strategy (IMCI) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
      Children's Fund (UNICEF) in the 1990s and is an excellent way to improve the quality of
      country's child health services. However, in Burkina Faso IMCI suffers from a low level of
      adherence by health workers. According to a recent evaluation by the Ministry of Health
      (MoH), only 8.2% of children had benefited in 2012 from an consultation using IMCI guideline.
      Moreover, an analysis of children's records showed that only 15% of IMCI consultations were
      being correctly delivered and, for instance, only 34% of children with pneumonia who needed
      an antibiotic were prescribed the correct treatment. The obstacles to IMCI adoption in
      Burkina Faso are diverse and include inadequate training methods, shortage of material
      (papers, forms), lack of quality supervision by district executive teams, lack of integration
      between IMCI monitoring tools and the national health information system etc.

      The Integrated eDiagnosis Approach (IeDA) aims to address the poor quality of child health
      services in Burkina Faso by increasing the level of adherence to IMCI guidelines. IeDA is an
      innovative strategy combining information and communication technologies (using the Registre
      Electronique des Consultations [REC], an electronic IMCI patient record designed by Terre des
      hommes, Tdh) and a quality improvement approach. The approach has been piloted over three
      years in two different districts in the north of Burkina Faso, Tougan and Séguénéga. This
      medium scaling-up demonstration project will combine implementation and research components
      with a goal to enable national scaleup.

      Terre des hommes is in charge of the implementation of the project and the London School of
      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) will coordinate the research component of the study in
      partnership with Centre Muraz.

      The primary hypothesis is that the Integrated eDiagnosis Approach will lead to improved
      adherence to IMCI guidelines and management of childhood illnesses in two regions (with a
      target of 75% of correct diagnoses and prescriptions).

    <description>Following the clinical observation of each child, the child will be re-consulted by study staff to determine the correct disease classification(s) and prescription(s). A binary variable will be created for the consultation based on whether the classification(s) and prescription(s) decided by the healthcare worker are in agreement with those of our study staff.This will be done at each step of the stepped-wedge trial, including at a baseline step (i.e. before any clusters are in the intervention phase).</description>

    <description>IeDA is a package of several interventions with the objective of improving the quality of child health care in health centres to ultimately decrease child morbidity and mortality. The components of IedA are described as follows:
REC: the IMCI protocol translated into a computer-based tool that aims to guide nurses during consultations.
The training of nurses on IMCI and REC.
A quality assurance mechanism through which each district and health centre is encouraged to find appropriate solutions in response to their local needs.
A supervision system conducted implemented by district managers to provide support and guidance to health centres.
A health information system based on data collected through the REC and fed back to the district managers and Heads of health centres.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Regions and Districts - The two regions Boucle du Mouhoune and Region du Nord were
        purposively chosen based on discussions with the MoH. Eight districts in these two regions
        will be included in the trial.

        Health centres - Ten health centres in each district will be randomly selected and
        stratified so that, in each district, five health centres with fewer children aged 0-59
        months than the district median and five health centres with more than the district median
        will be selected. The stratification reflects the variation in size between large and small
        health centres.

        Patients - Children aged under five years old who attend the health centre for consultation
        at the day of the visit of the researchers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Health centres - All health centres not selected in the study will be excluded from the
        evaluation of the trial, but will still receive the intervention.

        Patients - All children not present during the day of the visit of the researchers will be
        excluded. All patients above five years old will be excluded.
