      A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Dose-ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy
      and Safety of TG-2349 in Combination with Peg-interferon and Ribavirin in Treatment Naïve
      East Asian Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1b Infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      antiviral efficacy of two different doses of TG-2349 combined with Peg-interferon (IFN) and
      Ribavirin (RBV) in HCV-GT1b treatment naïve East Asian subjects. The treatment duration of
      TG-2349+IFN+RBV is 12 weeks, with or without an additional 12-week treatment of IFN+RBV,
      depending on HCV RNA level at On-Treatment Week 4. Approximately 24 subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Group I (n=12): 200 mg TG-2349 (2 capsules) + IFN + RBV

        -  Group II (n=12): 400 mg TG-2349 (4 capsules) + IFN + RBV Randomization will be
           stratified by IL28B genotype &quot;CC&quot; or &quot;non-CC&quot;. Subjects with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (lower limit
           of quantification), TD (target detected) or TND (target not detected) at Week 4 will
           receive 12 weeks of TG-2349+IFN+RBV treatment. Subjects with HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ but &lt; 100
           IU/mL at Week 4 will receive 12 weeks of TG-2349+IFN+RBV treatment followed by an
           additional 12 weeks of IFN+RBV treatment. However, subjects with HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL at
           Week 4 will discontinue the study treatment and complete the Early-Termination (ET)
           visit. The study will be terminated if 3 or more of the first 12 subjects enrolled
           across both Groups I and II, or ≥ 25% of subjects thereafter, fail to respond to
           treatment (i.e., confirmed on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse).
           Patients, except those who have achieved SVR12, will be offered the standard of care
           with Peg-interferon and Ribavirin for duration of 24, 48, or 72 weeks based on Taiwan's
           regulatory guideline and principal investigator's judgment.
