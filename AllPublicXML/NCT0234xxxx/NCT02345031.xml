  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that the investigational drug AUT00063 is effective and safe
      in the treatment of age-related hearing loss.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced activity at certain sites in the brain (called &quot;voltage-gated potassium channels&quot;)
      has been linked to hearing problems, like age-related loss of hearing or tinnitus (a
      'ringing' or buzzing noise in the ears).

      AUT00063 is an experimental new medicine that enhances the action of these specific channels
      and so may treat the brain component of these hearing problems.

      The main purpose of this study is to try to demonstrate an improvement in a speech-in-noise
      deficit after 4 weeks of treatment with the study drug versus the placebo (dummy drug which
      does not contain the drug). Subjects will undergo a safety follow-up after the treatment
      period.

      Safety and efficacy will be determined by looking at a number of assessments (physical
      examinations, blood sampling, hearing assessments, questionnaires, etc.).

      The amount of drug in the blood will also be measured. It is expected that around 70 people
      (at least 35 in each arm) with age-related hearing loss may take part in the study. The study
      participants will be recruited at around 13 sites in the USA.

    <measure>Change in Hearing Loss After 4 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the change in hearing using the QuickSIN test (speech in noise performance) from baseline (Day 1 to Day 28) between AUT00063 and placebo. The QuickSIN test measures the level of signal compared to the noise that is required to achieve 50% recognition. The test is administered in a sound booth at 70-dB HL binaurally via insert-ear phones. Three lists are administered to each individual subject and the threshold or 50% signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated as the mean of the three lists completed. Each list consists of six sentences with five key words to be scored per sentence. The sentences are presented in four-talker babble noise. The sentences are presented at pre-recorded signal-to-noise ratios which decrease in 5-dB steps from 25 (very easy) to 0 (extremely difficult).</description>

        <title>Change in Hearing Loss After 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>To compare the change in hearing using the QuickSIN test (speech in noise performance) from baseline (Day 1 to Day 28) between AUT00063 and placebo. The QuickSIN test measures the level of signal compared to the noise that is required to achieve 50% recognition. The test is administered in a sound booth at 70-dB HL binaurally via insert-ear phones. Three lists are administered to each individual subject and the threshold or 50% signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated as the mean of the three lists completed. Each list consists of six sentences with five key words to be scored per sentence. The sentences are presented in four-talker babble noise. The sentences are presented at pre-recorded signal-to-noise ratios which decrease in 5-dB steps from 25 (very easy) to 0 (extremely difficult).</description>
