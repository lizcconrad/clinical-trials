  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-step observational cohort study evaluating the impact of adding PikoLogic® to
      the current disease management COPD discharge protocol subsequent to an admission for COPD
      exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Candidate subjects participating in the cohort study will receive training by the clinical
      research associate (CRA) on the use of PikoLogic® for home disease management prior to
      discharge from the hospital. The CRA will also confirm COPD discharge education was completed
      by a discharge coordinator and the patient understood the instructions. The CRA will review
      &quot;seek medical care if:&quot; and &quot;seek immediate medical care if:&quot; instructions at discharge. The
      discharge CRA will also evaluate subjects for their ability to use the PikoLogic® correctly
      and will score the patient using an objective and subjective measurement tool. A modified
      Discharge Knowledge Assessment Tool© will be utilized.1 Objective measurements will include
      training time and patient compliance with PikoLogic® prior to discharge. Subjective data
      scores and objective measurements will be utilized for program implementation evaluation.

             hospitalization for 1 year.

          3. Lives in a neighborhood with poor or no cellular coverage.

          4. Is currently homeless or in jeopardy of being homeless during the 1 year study period.
