      1. To compare the corneal epithelial defect healing time between diabetic patients
           receiving and not receiving supplementary oxygen after vitrectomy.

        2. To determine whether factors such as age, duration of diabetes, duration of surgery and
           level of glycemic control have any influence on corneal epithelial wound healing time in
           diabetic patients receiving and not receiving supplementary oxygen post-vitrectomy.

      This study aims to determine whether systemic oxygen therapy delivered through face mask
      would have beneficial effects on the healing of corneal epithelial wound in post-vitrectomy
      diabetic patients. It will be a prospective, randomised interventional clinical study
      conducted on diabetic patients indicated for vitrectomy. Rationale of this study is to see if
      systemic oxygen delivered via face mask will hasten the resolution of corneal epithelial
      defects, which may either be iatrogenic (surgically-induced intra-operatively to enable
      clearer visualisation for the surgeon) or spontaneous (due to corneal epithelial fragility
      which is commoner in diabetics)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diabetic patients aged 18 years and above planned for pars plana vitrectomy that
             required intra-operative corneal epithelial debridement to allow better surgical
             visualisation of the fundus were recruited within the study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pre-existing ocular surface or corneal disease, recent eye surgery within one month
             from the vitrectomy, glaucoma and if the patients have any contraindications to oxygen
             therapy (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
