  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular
      concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction
      (SVF), has on pain and functionality in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SVF contains
      multiple cellular components, including stem cells, with both regenerative and
      anti-inflammatory properties. This therapy has shown promise for ameliorating the symptoms of
      RA. This study is designed to evaluate changes in pain and functionality in individuals with
      RA for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Overall Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Over the Course of a 12 Month Period as Measured by the Patient Activity Scale-II (PAS-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline over the course of 12 months using participants' assessment of their overall ability to be active. Mean scores will be used for baseline (day 0) and all interviews up to month 12 (months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12). Answer options are graded either according to a four point or ten point Likert response scale.</description>

    <description>Participant assessment of the change in their overall health from baseline to month 12 using the HAQ-II. Answer options are given as a four point Likert response scale.</description>
