  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than one in 100 otherwise healthy patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery will die
      within 30 days post-operatively, and of these patients 45% will die from vascular causes such
      as myocardial infarction. The pathogenesis of perioperative myocardial infarction is complex
      and to date not fully elucidated. The physiological stress response associated with the
      surgical procedure is believed to be central in the development of perioperative
      cardiovascular complications. Surgery initiates systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability and
      increases the production of catecholamines and cortisol. These drastic systemic changes lead
      to a state of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, which added to acute endothelial
      dysfunction and ruptures of vulnerable plaques, may result in myocardial injury.

      The endothelium is a regulator of vascular homeostasis, vascular tone and structure and
      exerts anticoagulant, antiplatelet and fibrinolytic properties. Endothelial dysfunction is
      characterized by a decreased vascular bioavailability of nitric oxide probably due to an
      increased degradation of nitric oxide via its interaction with locally produced reactive
      oxygen species. No clinical studies have investigated whether peri- and postoperative
      endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial
      injury. Endothelial dysfunction may be a key element in the development of perioperative
      myocardial injury.

      The aim of this observational clinical study is to closely examine the endothelial function
      and its dynamics in the early postoperative period.
