  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical study is designed to examine the safety and feasibility of using
      anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) as treatment of relapse after
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for patients with hematologic
      malignancies with bone marrow involvement of their relapsed disease. These MILs will be
      derived from the bone marrow of the relapsed patient who had previously received
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      (PTCy-MILs). A bone marrow aspiration will be performed on the patient to collect ~200ml of
      marrow for ex vivo expansion. During this expansion process, T cells will be activated and
      expanded by co-stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached
      to super-paramagnetic microbeads. Patients will be treated with salvage therapy while this ex
      vivo expansion is ongoing. After the simultaneous salvage therapy and ex vivo expansion, the
      activated PTCy-MILs will be reinfused. Patients will be monitored with the primary objective
      being the feasibility of expanding to targeted dose levels activated PTCy-MILs that do not
      cause grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first 90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years old

          -  Bone marrow relapse of a hematologic malignancy ≥6 months after alloHCT using PTCy

          -  Donor CD3+ chimerism ≥ 30% measured in peripheral blood or bone marrow

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 or Karnofsky performance scale ≥ 70%.

          -  Off all immunosuppressive drugs for 2 weeks prior to the PTCy-MILs collection.

          -  Expectation of ability to safely undergo salvage treatment appropriate for the
             patient's malignant disease type as determined by the treating hematologist/
             oncologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Most recent alloHCT not utilizing PTCy.

          -  Active GVHD requiring treatment.

          -  Immunosuppression use within 28 days of PTCy-MIL infusion if prior grade II-IV acute
             GVHD.

          -  Creatinine ≥ 2.5, total bilirubin &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or
             AST/ALT &gt; 3 times the ULN.

          -  HIV-1/2 or HTLV-1/2 positivity.

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 90 days even with aggressive treatment, as determined by the
             treating hematologist/oncologist, which would preclude assessment of toxicity of
             PTCy-MILs
