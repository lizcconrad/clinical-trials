    <textblock>
      The Phase II randomized, two-armed clinical study will investigate the efficacy of high dose
      versus low dose Bromelain (Comosain) in human subjects diagnosed with advanced late stage
      cancers. The study subjects will be randomly assigned to each group by a coin toss. Bromelain
      (Comosain) extract, derived from the stem and fruit of Ananas Comosus will be administered
      orally each day.

           Patients suffering from late stage breast, lung, colon, cervical, ovarian, and uterine
           cancers in stages III and IV, with tissue proof of well-documented malignancies, whether
           by tissue biopsies and/or laparatomy or thoracotomy and have not been helped by
           conventional radiation therapy and/or chemotherapies are eligible for this study.

                agents.

             5. Patient has a history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, peptic
                ulcer disease, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to study
                enrollment.

             6. Patient currently has uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, or clinically

             9. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

            10. Patient with tumors that are widely spread in the chest and abdomen that cannot be
                measured by CT scan.

           Patients who are eligible for this study will be randomly assigned to either the low
           dose group or the high dose group by a coin toss. Each study subject will be assigned a
           patient number for the purpose of this study.

        2. Drug Dosage and Schedule

           High Dose Group-The oral dose of Bromelain (50 mg/kg/day) is extrapolated from in vivo
           animal studies, and determined to be safe by a Safety study on healthy human subjects
           (see Section VII-A). For this clinical investigation, the High Dose group will be given
           Bromelain at 50 mg/kg/day, to a maximum of 2400 mg/day (divided into 2 doses/day of 1200
           mg/dose)

           Low Dose Group - Low Dose group will be given 10 mg/kg/day, to a maximum of 500 mg/day
           (divided into 2 doses/day of 250 mg/dose).

           The number of patients suffering from well-documented malignancies to be assigned to
           this group will be at least 30: with the combination of mixed types carcinoma of breast,
           lung, colon, gastro-intestinal, ovarian, cervical, uterine, prostatic, hepatic, bladder,
           lymphoma, melanoma, and so forth. These patients will be given Bromelain at 500 mg/day,
           divided into two doses of 250 mg/dose and taken with meals.

           High Dose Group - The dose will be at 50 mg/kg/day, The number of patients suffering
           from well-documented malignancies with be at least 60: with the combination of mixed
           types carcinoma of breast, lung, colon, gastro-intestinal, ovarian, cervical, uterine,
           prostatic, hepatic, bladder, lymphoma, melanoma, and so forth. These patients will be
           given Bromelain at 2400 mg/day, divided into two doses of 1200 mg/dose and taken with
           meals.

        3. Duration and Route of Administration Study subjects will be provided with Bromelain for
           oral administration. The containers will be clearly labeled (see Section V-E). Bromelain
           will be taken orally twice daily with meals. On their biweekly visits to the Doctor's
           Office, the Study patients will be provided with enough doses for two weeks. The study
           patients are required to keep a journal of the daily doses they take and any side
           effects they experience.

      The study patients will be evaluated using blood tests and CT scans at six months for signs
      of disease progression. If the disease did not progress, then treatment will continue and the
      patient will be evaluated every six months thereafter until the investigator determines
      otherwise. If the disease did progress, then the patient will be taken off the study.
