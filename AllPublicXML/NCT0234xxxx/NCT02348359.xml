      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following dose groups:

        -  X-82 50 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn

        -  X-82 100 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn

        -  X-82 200 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn

        -  Placebo plus ivt anti-VEGF prn

      Subjects will be treated for a total of 52 weeks with one of three doses of X-82 or placebo.

      Primary Efficacy Outcome:

      The primary efficacy outcome is the change in visual acuity score from Day -1 to 52 Weeks
      after randomization.

      Safety Outcomes:

      Systemic and ocular safety will be evaluate by assessing ECG, laboratory analyses, adverse
      events and serious adverse events.

      Approximately 132 subjects will be randomized into one of the four arms (33 subjects per dose
      group).
