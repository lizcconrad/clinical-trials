    <description>Estimated acceleration factors expressed as the ratio of the time to resolution of influenza symptoms as compared to placebo time to negativity. Resolution of influenza symptoms was the time of the first of 3 evaluations (over 24 hours) in which all symptom scores for each of the 3 assessments are 0 or 1 for all 7 primary influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal stuffiness, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) of the Flu-iiQ^TM. The Flu-iiQ^TM questionnaire consists of 4 modules, including 1 module assessing influenza symptoms, 1 module assessing the impact of influenza on normal functioning, and 2 modules assessing the impact of influenza on the subject's emotional state. The Influenza Symptom assessment (Module 1) is scored on a 4 point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) for each of 10 influenza symptoms.</description>

          6. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 33.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and a total body weight &gt;50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria: Part B

          1. History of any illness or any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or the subject's general practitioner, might confound the results of the

               -  An investigational drug or device 30 days before the first dose of study drug, 5
                  half lives before the first dose of study drug, or time determined by local
