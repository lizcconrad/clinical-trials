  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States is currently experiencing an increase in the incidence and prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2 to 4% of the
      population, untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease,
      including hypertension and heart failure, daytime sleepiness, and increased risk of motor
      vehicle accidents.

      This study was design in order to evaluate the CelonProSleep plus for multi-level
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the palate and base of tongue as a treatment for mild to
      moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

    <measure>The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a clinically significant reduction of obstructive sleep apnea at 12-Month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the reduction in the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). The objective is to demonstrate at least a 50% responder rate at the 12-Month follow-up visit. A responder to the radiofrequency treatment is defined as a subject with at least a 50% reduction of their AHI.</description>
