    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomized into 3 treatment groups (15 subjects per group): 1) Control -
      received no treatment 2) Placebo - received a sham Astym速 treatment 3) Astym速 Treatment -
      received Astym速 treatment to the lower extremity. Subjects were blinded to whether they
      received the Astym速 treatment or placebo treatment intervention. After a 5-minute warm-up on
      a lower body ergometer the subjects were familiarized to the operations of a computerized leg
      press machine that measured the maximum force output (Newtons) during a unilateral isometric
      squat test. A baseline measure of maximal force output (pre-test) was determined by the
      average of 3 trials with a 30 second rest period between the trials. The subjects then
      received the designated treatment intervention. Immediately following the treatment
      intervention (0 minutes following treatment intervention) the subjects were retested
      (post-test) using identical testing procedures by an investigator blinded to the treatment
      intervention received by the subject. Maximum force output measured in Newtons for the
      post-test was subtracted from the maximum force output (Newtons) pre-test and then converted
      to a percentage of change [(post-test - pretest)/pretest X 100). The percent change of
      maximal force output from pre-test to post-test measures was compared using a one-way
      analysis of variance with alpha set at 0.05. A Tukey's post-hoc analysis determined
      statistical differences between the groups.
