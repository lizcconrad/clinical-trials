    <textblock>
      Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a validated marker for reducing the risk of interval
      colorectal cancer after a screening colonoscopy. Recent studies suggest that novel devices
      attached to the colonoscope tip may improve the ADR of doctors performing a screening
      procedure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that continuing medical education, time of colonoscopy during the
      day, forced longer withdrawal time, use of high definition colonoscopes all result in
      improving ADR although the gains have only been modest. To this end, adding novel devices to
      the tip of colonoscope may improve the ability of doctors to perform a better procedure. We
      therefore propose to identify the increase in ADR with 3 of these devices compared to
      standard colonoscopy. Fuse colonoscopy (2 cameras embedded at the side of the colonoscope tip
      providing an increased angle of view), EndoCuff (a plastic cap to fit the tip with flexible
      arms which hold the mucosa back aiding in inspection), EndoRings (similar to EndoCuff but the
      arms are wider) have been shown in tandem colonoscopy studies to improve the adenoma miss
      rates to 7-15% instead of the miss rates seen with standard colonoscopy which is usually
      about 40%. All these devices are FDA approved and are distributed in the United States.
