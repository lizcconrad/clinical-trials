  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary management of CKD patients proved important to postpone dialysis. Long-term
      compliance to protein-restricted diets was discussed. Psychological aspects involved in
      certain dietary behaviour have never been studied.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interest in dietary management resurged, since the high prevalence of revealed a major
      impact not only on morbidity, mortality, social activities and patients' quality of life, but
      also on health budget.

      Although protein-restricted diets are used for more than a century in patients with advanced
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), their efficacy and safety is still debatable. Enough evidence
      has being accumulated on their role in postponing dialysis initiation in compliant patients.
      Consequently, the long-term compliance to the diet is discussed. Psychological aspects of
      compliant patients are certainly involved. Identification of certain psychological predictors
      of dietary compliance could help to select the patients who are more likely to be compliant
      and therefore to benefit from such an intervention. Moreover, short-term or long-term
      psychological intervention addressing these factors could increase patient long-term
      compliance.

      Accordingly, we are aiming to evaluate psychological characteristics of Chronic Kidney
      Disease patients in relation with their compliance to protein-restricted regimens.

        All consecutive adult patients, with stage 4-5ND CKD (estimated glomerular filtration by
        MDRD formula of less than 30 mL/min per year) included in the dietary intervention program
        of &quot;Dr Carol Davila&quot; Teaching Hospital of Nephrology coming for the scheduled visits
        between January the 1st and June the 30th, 2014 will be considered eligible.

        Those who will sign the informed consent will be included in the study; the
        specially-designed questionnaire will be administered. Simultaneously, their routine
        assesment, including the dietary compliance, manifestations of CKD and the nutritional
        status will be performed, as recommended by the Romanian Best Practice Guidelines for CKD
        [28].
