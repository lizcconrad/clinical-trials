  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Running is a natural part of human locomotion and humans have been running for million of
      years. In modern society, running has become a popular way of exercise and is undertaken by
      many people worldwide, possibly because it provides a cheap and easily accessible form of
      exercise, and the positive effects of running on health and fitness are well known.
      Unfortunately, running is also associated with a high risk of injury.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate how a running schedule which focuses either on
      running distance or running speed influence the overall risk of injury and the types of
      injury sustained in recreational runners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trails directed at investigating differences in injury risk in relation to the focus of the
      running schedule have been conducted without any firm conclusions. People engaged in
      recreational running or choosing running as a new and active lifestyle needs guidance on
      which running schedules minimize the injury risk, aiding their chance of an active lifestyle
      and possibly reversing the increase in people developing a lifestyle disease. To develop
      running schedules minimizing the risk of injury, an understanding of the mechanisms that the
      different training variables impose on the human body is necessary. The existing literature
      on running intensity and the development of injuries show conflicting result. More studies
      are necessary to ascertain if there is a relationship between the intensity of running. In
      such studies, it is important to include other training variables in the analysis and to
      quantify running exposure using an objective method of measuring the relative intensity and
      absolute volume.
