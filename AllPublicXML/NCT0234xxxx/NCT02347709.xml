  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the degree of loss of epidermal nerve
      fibers near a foot wound in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The secondary purpose will be
      to determine whether the degree of epidermal nerve fiber loss, the clinical examination,
      nerve conduction studies or the molecular profile correlates with appearance of lower
      extremity ulcers in patients with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes seen in up to 43% of patients with diabetes.
      The relationship between neuropathy and diabetic lower extremity wounds is strong and in
      fact, 80% of patients with an existing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) have neuropathy.
      Understanding the factors that contribute to the increased risk of wounds in patients with
      neuropathy is important in creating optimal strategies to reduce this risk.

      Traditionally, the severity of diabetic neuropathy has been evaluated using the clinical exam
      and nerve conduction studies. More recently, new techniques such as intra-epidermal nerve
      fiber density have shown promise in evaluating neuropathy especially the small nerve fiber
      neuropathies that might affect pain sensation and autonomic function. There are also new
      molecular markers that may correlate with the risk of neuropathy that may also be useful in
      clinically evaluating the diabetic patient with neuropathy.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the degree of loss of epidermal nerve
      fibers near a foot wound in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The secondary purpose will be
      to determine whether the degree of epidermal nerve fiber loss, the clinical examination,
      nerve conduction studies or the molecular profile correlates with appearance of lower
      extremity ulcers in patients with diabetes.

    <description>Group 1 will be recruited from the Wound Center, and will include patients with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (defined as HgA1c ≥5.9%), and a diabetic foot ulcer (defined as a break in the skin on the foot). Subjects in this group will complete a survey, undergo a Comprehensive Neuropathy Evaluation, and have a photograph and biopsy of their Diabetic Foot Ulcer in addition to the standard of care.</description>

    <description>Group 2 will be recruited from the Neurology clinic and will include patients with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (defined as HgA1c ≥ 5.9%) and neuropathy. Subjects in this group will complete a survey and undergo a Comprehensive Neuropathy Evaluation in addition to the standard of care.</description>

    <description>Group 3 will be recruited from the Endocrinology clinic and will include patients with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (defined as HgA1c ≥ 5.9%) who currently do not have a diagnosis of neuropathy or a diabetic foot ulcer. Subjects in this group will complete a survey and undergo a Comprehensive Neuropathy Evaluation in addition to the standard of care.</description>
