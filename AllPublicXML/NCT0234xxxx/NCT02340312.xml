      Recurrent abdominal pain has long been acknowledged to be the most common chronic pain
      entities in children. The purpose of this study is to describe the microbiome in children
      with FD and to explore relationships between the microbiome and postprandial distress
      syndrome, anxiety scores, and mucosal biomarkers or anxiety. The specific goals of this study
      are to: 1) Determine the frequencies and relative proportions for specific bacteria or
      bacteria phyla in children with FD in both duodenal mucosal specimens and stool samples. 2)
      Determine if the frequencies or proportions of specific bacteria or bacteria phyla differ
      between children with and without PDS. 3) Determine bi-variate correlations between
      bacteria/phyla frequency, bacteria/phyla proportions, anxiety scores, and mucosal biomarkers,
      respectively.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent abdominal pain has long been acknowledged to be one of the most common chronic pain
      entities in children. In the US, ~13-17% of school-aged children and adolescents report
      abdominal pain that occurs at least weekly and 21% of these report pain severe enough to
      interfere with daily activities. (1) For most of these children (~90%), no specific organic
      disease is found. However, these children experience decreases in quality of life that are
      comparable to children with identifiable organic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease
      and gastro-esophageal reflux. (2) In addition, children with no identifiable organic disease
      do not appear to get better on their own and often continue to have problems with abdominal
      pain and associated symptoms into adulthood. (3,4)

      Over 90% of children with chronic abdominal pain will fit the diagnostic criteria for a
      functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). (5) As defined by Rome criteria, the FGIDs are a
      set of diagnoses with specific symptom profiles in the absence of structural or biochemical
      abnormalities to explain symptoms. FGIDs related to chronic or recurrent abdominal pain
      include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), functional abdominal pain
      (FAP), and abdominal migraine. (6) FGIDs are probably best understood utilizing a
      biopsychosocial model which states that abdominal pain occurs as a result of varying
      contributions from, and interactions between, biological factors, psychological factors, and
      social factors. The biological factors most implicated in the generation of abdominal pain
      include motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and inflammation. Stress/anxiety is
      the most implicated psychologic factor. Anxiety may interact with both motility and
      inflammation. For example, the investigators have demonstrated an association between anxiety
      and mucosal mast cells in children with post-prandial distress syndrome, a subcategory of FD.
      (7) The scaffolding for the interaction between the various factors has been termed the
      brain-gut axis consisting of both neural and humoral pathways.

      There is increasing evidence that the investigators need to expand this paradigm to include
      interaction of the biopsychosocial model with the intestinal flora, i.e. a
      brain-gut-microbiota axis (B-G-M axis). It is becoming increasingly clear that host anxiety
      and stress can effect the composition of the microbiome. (8) Likewise, the microbiome can
      influence neural development, brain chemistry, and a wide range of behavioral phenomena
      including emotional behavior, pain perception, and how the stress system responds. (9) Both
      immune and neural pathways are involved intimately in visceral pain perception and intestinal
      microbiota can modulate this communication. (8) The general scaffolding of the
      brain-gut-microbiota axis includes the CNS, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, autonomic
      nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. (10) Microbiota communicate with the
      brain-gut axis through different mechanisms including direct interaction with mucosal cells,
      via immune cells, and via contact with neural endings. (11)

      The B-G-M axis has been studied primarily under four conditions: 1. germ free intestines, 2.
      infection or bacterial introduction, 3. antibiotic exposure, and 4. probiotic treatment. Germ
      free mice exhibit anxiety-like behavior accompanied by decreased N-metyl-D-aspartate receptor
      subunit mRNA expression in the amygdala and increased BDNF expression and decreased serotonin
      receptor 1A expression in the dentate granule layer of the hippocampus. (12) The brain is
      aware of the introduction of pathogenic microbes into the GI tract and this results in brain
      stem nuclei becoming activated and in some instances, associated with the development of
      anxiety-like behavior. (8) This occurs within hours after introduction of pathogens at
      subclinical thresholds. (8) Even minute doses of microbes that do not trigger an immune
      response are capable of influencing neurotransmission in the paraventricular hypothalamus,
      the central nucleus of the amygdale, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, three
      regions involved in the processing of emotions related to anxiety and mood. (13) Citerobacter
      rodentium (CR) is a bacteria that has been evaluated in a number of studies involving mice.
      CR-infected mice demonstrated anxious-like behavior at 7-8 hours. (14) CR has been
      demonstrated to induce anxiety-like behavior associated with no change in plasma levels of
      IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-12 but with evidence of increased vagal transmission without mucosal
      inflammation. (15) Additional work has also demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori infected
      mice exhibit anxiety-like behavior corrected by treatment with a probiotic, Bifidobacterium.
      Oral antibiotics have also been shown to induce anxiety-like behavior in mice. (8) This
      behavior change is transient and behavior normalizes once normal flora has been restored.
      This effect is not seen with systemic antibiotic administration. Changes in behavior are
      accompanied by an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and
      amygdala. (8) Lastly, clinical evidence is mounting to support a role for probiotics in
      reducing anxiety and the stress response as well as improving mood in patients with IBS and
      those with chronic fatigue. (14) Probiotics have been shown to reduce anxiety in rats and to
      have beneficial psychological effects with a decrease in serum cortisol in humans. (14)
      Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to decrease anxiety and the stress-induced increase in
      corticosterone in mice. (A) In addition, there are a number of other studies demonstrating
      the effects of probiotics on anxiety in humans. (8,9,13)

      The DCX-domain family of proteins has been demonstrated to be involved in signal transduction
      and cytoskeletal regulation. The investigators have demonstrated that DCDC3a (DCLK1/DCAMKL1)
      is an intestinal epithelial stem cell marker expressed in the intestinal mesenchymal stem
      cell niche which plays a critical role during intestinal tissue damage and repair. DCDC2 is
      altered in the mouse model by Citrobacter rodentium infection and TNBS induced colitis. DCDC2
      knockout mice exhibit an increased anxiety phenotype. (16)

      BDNF has been found to promote neuronal survival and differentiation and to guide axon
      extension both in vitro and in vivo. (17) Evidence suggests that BDNF may act as a
      stress-responsive intercellular messenger modifying HPA axis activity. (17) Short-term acute
      stress induces a significant increase in BDNF mRNA and protein in both younger and older
      groups but changes in the younger group are substantially greater. (18) BDNF has interactions
      with both inflammation and pain. BDNF knock out mice show a weaker visceral response to
      colorectal distention. (19) A human study compared 40 adults with IBS to 21 healthy controls.
      (20) Biopsies from patients with IBS revealed significant upregulation of BDNF as compared to
      controls. (20)

      The transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) is expressed throughout the
      gastrointestinal tract in myenteric ganglia, muscular layers, and mucosa and TRPV1 expression
      has been reported on mast cells. (21) TRPV1 is expressed by intestinal sensory nerves and
      activated by capsaicin, heat, acid, and inflammation. (21) TRPV1 receptor has been implicated
      as a mechanosensor involved in integrating painful stimuli and in the generation of
      neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia. (22) In rodent models of inflammation, TPRV1 is
      upregulated with subsequent visceral hyperalgesia to mechanical and chemical stimuli which
      can be attenuated by TRPV1 antagonism. (22,23) In the rat model, it appears that mast cells
      are required for upregulation TRPV1 under both infectious and stress conditions. (24) In
      humans with IBS, there is a significant increase in rectosigmoid TRPV1-immunoreactive fibers
      and TRPV1 and mast cells are related to abdominal pain scores. (21) Likewise, IBS in
      quiescent inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an increase in rectosigmoid colon
      TRPV1-immunoreactive fibers as compared to asymptomatic quiescent IBD or healthy controls and
      again these fibers correlate with the abdominal pain score. (25) There is evidence of a
      significant role for TRPV1 in visceral sensitivity and TRPV1 appears to interact with
      inflammation in general, mast cells in particular, and to be influenced by intestinal
      infection and stress.

      The major initiator of the body's physiological stress response is the release of
      corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). CRH, produced within the hypothalamus (as well as by
      immune cells, including human lymphocytes and mast cells), is the principal regulator of the
      basal and stress-induced pituitary-adrenal axis which, in turn, activates glucocorticoid
      (e.g. cortisol) and adrenal androgen secretion. Though results have been variable, the
      majority of studies support an enhanced HPA axis responsiveness in at least a subset of
      adults with IBS. (26-30) CRH receptors (CRH-R) are widely expressed within the
      gastrointestinal tract and immune cells, where CRH-R activation has multiple effects which
      may be relevant in the etiology of FGIDs. These effects include alteration of autonomic
      balance, visceral sensitivity, motility disturbances, and inflammation. The most important
      mechanism by which CRH may generate pain is through interaction with inflammatory cells,
      directly and via epithelial cells and enteric nerves. CRH mediates visceral hypersensitivity
      by activating mucosal mast cells with subsequent mediator sensitization of afferent sensory
      enteric nerves. (31,32) Gastric mast cells have been shown to be increased in adults with
      dyspepsia and may contain both pre-formed and newly synthesized cytokines (including IL-4,
      IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-α, among others). (33-34) The investigators have demonstrated delayed
      gastric emptying and increased gastric dysrhythmia in children/adolescents with FD with
      elevated antral mast cell density. (35) The investigators have also demonstrated this
      dysrhythmia to be associated with increased post-prandial pain. (36) Adult humans have
      demonstrated selective luminal release of tryptase and histamine from jejunal mast cells
      under cold stress; the magnitude of release was shown to be similar to that induced by
      antigen exposure in food allergic patients. (37) This is a rapid response with peak histamine
      and tryptase concentrations occurring between 15 and 30 minutes. Mast cells may also recruit
      eosinophils as a secondary effector cell. Eosinophils are increased in the duodenal mucosa of
      71% of children with FD and they have also been found to be increased in adults with FD.
      (38,39) These eosinophils are highly activated and the investigators have demonstrated
      clinical improvement with treatment directed at mucosal eosinophils. (40,41) The
      investigators have previously found a high correlation between anxiety scores and mucosal
      eosinophil density, providing preliminary support for the role of CRH in downstream
      eosinophil recruitment and activation. (42) Stress also has been shown to shift the relative
      proportion and trafficking of T helper lymphocytes towards a Th2 or &quot;allergic&quot; phenotype.
      This shift is driven by catecholamines and central CRH as well as CRH from peripheral nerves
      and inflammatory cells. The Th2 phenotype is associated with release of IL 4,IL 10, and IL
      13, which stimulate growth and activation of mast cells and eosinophils. (43) CRH also has
      been associated with increased expression of TNF-α, MCP1, and IL 8, which have, in turn, been
      associated with hyperalgesia. (44-46) As described above, CRH can initiate an inflammatory
      cascade which may lead to pain directly or indirectly by causing dysmotility and visceral
      hypersensitivity.

      The purpose of the current study is to describe the microbiome in children with FD and to
      explore relationships between the microbiome and postprandial distress syndrome, anxiety
      scores, and mucosal biomarkers or anxiety.

    <description>Fecal samples and 8 mucosal biopsies (descending duodenum) will be obtained from each subject. Samples will be processed and DNA isolated per standard lab techniques.16S rDNA sequence analysis of microbial communities within patient samples will be analyzed utilizing our HiSeq 1500 rapid run technologies. We will perform 2 X 150 bp paired end sequencing which will give exceptional coverage (reads &gt; 30,000). We will sequence the V4 region of 16s RNA (E. coli 515-806), which is the method optimized for Illumina HiSeq 1500 currently. We will also sequence simultaneously the V3 region of 16s RNA to provide a dual-control analysis of samples. Confirmatory PCR will be employed when appropriate.

    <description>Routine histology slides previously stained with hematoxylin and eosin will be utilized for determination of eosinophil density.
IHC techniques will be utilized for determination of mast cell density. Serial 3-μm paraffin sections will be air dried and heat fixed on slides. The sections will be deparaffinized with xylene and iodine and rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol. Utilizing tryptase monoclonal mouse antihuman mast cell tryptase antibody (clone AA1, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), sections will be stained on an automated Dako Autostainer 3400 using Dako's LSAB+ kit with streptoavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
To determine density for each cell type, the entire specimen will be scanned to determine the subjective area of greatest involvement. Density will be determined by counting cells within 5 consecutive high-power fields (400X magnification). Peak and mean cell densities expressed as cells/hpf will be determined. This will be completed before study end.</description>

A sem-quantitative scoring system will be applied in which the final immunoreactive score will equal the product of the percentage of positive cells times the average staining intensity. Percentage of positive cells or fibers will be graded as follows: 0= negative-10%, 1= 11-33%, 2= 33-66%, and 3= &gt; 67%. Immunoreactivity will be considered positive when the combined score ranges between 2-6 and negative with a score of 0-1.
