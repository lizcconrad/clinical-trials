      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study of
      maintenance Vigil Ovarian (gemogenovatucel-T) in women with Stages IIIb, IIIc or IV
      high-grade papillary serous/clear cell/endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
      peritoneal cancer. Subjects will have had a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses of Vigil
      prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at the time of primary surgical
      debulking or initial diagnostic/evaluative laparoscopy (tissue for immunotherapy manufacture
      must be procured prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy). An equal number of placebo
      doses will manufactured. Subjects will have achieved a clinically defined complete response
      following primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study of
      maintenance Vigil Ovarian (gemogenovatucel-T) engineered autologous tumor cells (EATC) in
      women with Stage IIIb, IIIc or IV high-grade papillary serous/ clear cell / endometrioid
      ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Subjects will have had a minimum of 4
      and a maximum of 12 doses of Vigil prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at
      the time of primary surgical debulking or initial diagnostic / evaluative laparoscopy (tissue
      for immunotherapy manufacture must be procured prior to initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy). An equal number of placebo doses will be manufactured. Subjects will have
      achieved a clinically defined complete response following primary surgery and adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      Investigational treatment must start no less than 3 weeks and no more than 8 weeks following
      completion of chemotherapy.

      Approximately 86 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either monthly intradermal Vigil
      or placebo for at least 4 to a maximum of 12 administrations. Randomization will be
      stratified by (i) extent of surgical cytoreduction (complete/microscopic versus macroscopic
      residual disease) and (ii) neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy. The objective is
      determining RFS of subjects randomized to Vigil versus placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects will be eligible for tissue procurement for the Vigil manufacturing process if
        they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Presumptive Stage IIIb, IIIc or IV high-grade papillary serous/clear cell/endometrioid
             ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

          2. No chemotherapy prior or investigational agents prior to tissue acquisition for Vigil
             manufacture.

          3. No other malignancy (excluding surgically cured nonmelanoma carcinomas of the skin and
             carcinoma in situ cervix) unless in remission for ≥ 2 years.

          4. Anticipated availability of a cumulative mass of ~30 grams tissue (&quot;golf-ball&quot; size or
             approximately 3cm disease on CT scan) at time of diagnostic laparoscopy or primary
             surgical debulking. Infiltrating lumen (bowel, fallopian tube, urethra) tissue should
             not be used as Vigil immunotherapy material to minimize risk of bacterial
             contamination.

          5. ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 prior to diagnostic laparoscopy or debulking
             laparotomy.

          6. No prior history of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) with taxanes or platinums.

          7. No prior history of allergies or sensitivities to gentamicin.

          8. Female, 18 years of age or older.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             for tissue harvest.

          2. Completion of primary surgical debulking including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo
             oophorectomy, and at least 5 but no more than 8 cycles of platinum / taxane adjuvant
             chemotherapy or chemotherapy as per Category 1 recommendations of the NCCN guidelines,
             including 5-8 cycles adjuvant intraperitoneal + intravenous (IP/IV) chemotherapy, or
             5-8 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy divided and administered as neoadjuvant and
             adjuvant therapy flanking primary debulking surgery.

          3. Clinically defined complete response (cCR) following completion of primary surgical
             debulking and eligible chemotherapy. cCR defined as no evidence of malignancy on chest

             physical examination, CA-125 antigen level ≤ 35 U/ml (assessed ≥ 2 weeks following
             removal of catheter in subjects receiving intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy)
             and no findings on physical examination or symptoms suggestive of active cancer.

          4. Subjects must have initiated adjuvant chemotherapy no more than 8 weeks following
             primary debulking surgery.

          5. Successful manufacturing of at least 4 doses (vials) of Vigil and placebo.

          6. Recovered from all clinically relevant toxicities related to prior therapy (including
             neuropathy ≤Grade 2).

          7. ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1.

          8. Normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute granulocyte count ≥
             1,500/mm^3, Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 500/mm^3, Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm^3, Total
             bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)≤ 2x institutional upper limit of normal,

             hemodynamically significant atrial arrhythmia, or cardiovascular disease such as
