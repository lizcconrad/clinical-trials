  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of an investigational compound, BLXA4-ME,
      topically applied as a daily oral rinse in adults with gingivitis. Safety will be assessed by
      the incidence of adverse events, including mucosal inflammation and irritancy and findings
      from safety labs. Subjects will be monitored for development of periodontitis, and oral flora
      will be analyzed to detect an increase in opportunistic organisms.

      The secondary objective is to assess preliminary efficacy of the oral rinse, by monitoring
      changes in the plaque index (PI), modified gingival index (MGI), bleeding on probing (BOP)
      and levels of interleukin -1β (IL-1β) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).

      The study comprises three groups in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical
      trial design. The treatment group (1.0 μM BLXA4-ME oral rinse) and the placebo rinse group
      will each include 50 subjects. The no-rinse control group will consist of 25 subjects.
      Subjects in the treatment and placebo rinse groups will receive oral rinse (BLXA4-ME or
      placebo) to be applied once daily after morning teeth brushing. Safety parameters will be
      assessed before and after 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of treatment. Efficacy parameters will be
      assessed before and after 14 and 28 days of treatment.

    <description>Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study, and may include events reported by subjects or changes observed in oral cavity examinations or vital signs (assessed at baseline, Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28). Blood and urine will be collected for safety labs at Days 14 and 28 after product administration, and subjects will undergo close monitoring for mucosal inflammation and irritancy and development of periodontitis, using standard clinical periodontal measurements. Follow-up will also occur at 90 days to assess for adverse events.</description>

    <description>BLXA4-ME is a member of a new class of chemically and metabolically stable lipoxin analogs featuring a replacement of the tetraene unit of native lipoxin-A4 (LXA4) with a substituted benzo-fused ring system. The full chemical name of the BLXA4-ME drug substance is (5S, 6R, E)-methyl 5,6-dihydroxy-8-(2-((R,E)-3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl) phenyl) oct-7-enoate.</description>
