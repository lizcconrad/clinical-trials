  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotoxic chemotherapy, including oxaliplatin, are responsible for very disabling
      neuropathic pain that can last for months or even years after the end of chemotherapy.
      Currently, there is no effective neuroprotective treatment to prevent or relieve this pain.
      The only strategy is the reduction of oxaliplatin doses or premature discontinuation of
      therapy, with the risk of burdening the prognosis for remission. Thus, a better understanding
      of the pathophysiology of these iatrogenic neuropathies appears necessary in order to
      discover new potential therapeutic targets.

      Preclinical works were able to demonstrate important metabolic changes in certain brain
      structures in an animal model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. A significant increase of
      choline concentration has been found in the posterior insular cortex of neuropathic animals
      compared with control animals. Furthermore, the concentrations of choline were positively
      correlated to nociceptive thresholds. Thus, neuropathic pain induced by oxaliplatin would
      involve the posterior insular cortex and would be associated with an increase in choline
      concentration at this level. Clinical translation of these preclinical results is feasible in
      practice since choline concentration can be determined in the brain by non-invasive magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate a significant increase in choline concentration
      in the insular cortex of patients with an oxaliplatin induced neuropathy. Other objectives
      will assess the correlation between metabolite concentrations in the insular cortex and
      frequency / intensity of pain and neuropathic symptoms, cold and heat-induced pain and
      comorbidities (anxiety, pain, quality of life).
