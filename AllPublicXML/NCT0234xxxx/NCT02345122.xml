  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four-year research study will evaluate an integrated care model of telephone-based,
      computer-aided care management using a new role of Mental Health Technician and specialized
      software to support primary care providers in providing mental health care. The study will
      compare the effectiveness of this model vs. enhanced usual care in improving initiation of
      specific treatment by the primary care provider, reduction in severity of symptoms, and
      improvement in quality of life or functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of an intervention to improve the outcomes of depressive
      disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and at-risk drinking or alcohol use disorders
      in primary care. Over 3 years, adult patients who self-refer, or are referred by their
      Primary Care Provider, and consent and meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      either: (1) usual care provided by their Primary Care Provider enhanced by a baseline
      assessment and follow-up assessments 4, 8, and 12 months later; or (2) an intervention
      consisting of care provided by their Primary Care Provider enhanced by a baseline assessment,
      follow-up assessments 4, 8, and 12 months later plus psychoeducation, monitoring, and support
      offered by telephone by a Mental Health Technician receiving supervision from a project
      psychiatrist.

      At baseline and 4, 8, and 12 months later, symptoms, quality of life, and function of all
      participants will be assessed by telephone by Research Analysts (RAs) blind to the
      randomization. In addition, at 12 months, patient satisfaction will be assessed. Results of
      these assessments will be shared with the participant's Primary Care Provider, regardless of
      randomization. The Primary Care Provider will receive a document summarizing the results of
      the baseline assessment and the three follow-up assessments for the participants of both the
      usual care and intervention groups. For participants in the intervention group the Primary
      Care Provider will also receive treatment recommendations and updates as needed.

      In the enhanced usual care group, the Primary Care Provider will treat the participant as
      they deem appropriate. In the intervention group, participants will be assigned to a team
      constituted by a Mental Health Technician and a psychiatrist. The team will communicate
      evidence-based treatment recommendations to the Primary Care Provider, for example initiating
      the use of an antidepressant or referring the participant for therapy or counselling. The
      Mental Health Technician will offer participants telephone-based psychoeducation about their
      diagnoses made by their Primary Care Provider or other consulting physicians, their symptoms,
      and the treatment selected by the Primary Care Provider. The Mental Health Technician will
      also monitor by phone the progress of treatment and communicate updates to the Primary Care
      Provider with additional recommendations as required. Thus, the Mental Health Technician will
      contact the Primary Care Provider on an as needed basis. In addition, for participants who
      are doing well and for whom no new recommendations are needed, the Mental Health Technician
      will provide a brief &quot;progress report&quot; to the Primary Care Provider on a monthly basis.

      In addition, at the completion of the one-year period, the RA will review all the
      participants' charts to abstract the intervention (e.g., medications, doses, refills) and
      other health services (e.g., diagnostic tests, referrals, mental health evaluations) they
      have received during their participation in the study. The chart audit will be conducted
      using REDCap, a secure application supported by the CAMH Information Management Group (IMG).
      IMG has all the necessary physical and operational securities in place to meet security and
      privacy regulations for data transmission and storage using REDCap. Investigators will follow
      the best practices outlined by IMG to ensure that all data and information is kept private
      and confidential.

    <measure>Severity of depressive symptoms, as measured with PHQ-9 during phone interviews at 4, 8, and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Mixed models will be used adjusting for relevant covariates and clustering within subjects over time, within sites, and within Primary Care Providers. Change in PHQ-9 scores (follow-up minus baseline scores) will be compared between treatment groups with a linear contrast model including the main effects of time, treatment group, and their interaction with the expectation to detect a group effect and a group x time interaction. Time will have 4 levels (Baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months); treatment group will have two levels (EUC and Intervention). We will test the bivariate association between baseline socio-demographics and baseline PHQ-9 scores with treatment group. Variables associated at a significance level of 0.05, will be entered in the model as covariates. Comorbidities will be also entered as control variables. In addition, exploratory analyzes will explore the time effect, that is, how PHQ-9 changes at each time point, and how that compares between the study groups.</description>

    <measure>Initiation or change in antidepressant medication documented in the health record at the 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) will be used to compare the proportion of subjects that started the treatment for each specific comorbidity in the first 12 months after start of the study. The model will use logit link and consider sites and PCPs as clustering structures, and besides the simple test of study group effect the model will also control for relevant covariates detected in the initial descriptive group comparison (see Primary Outcome). Time will also enter the model as a categorical predictor with 4 levels. Separate models will be fitted for each condition (depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder) and each model will control for the existence or not of the other two conditions. The outcome variable for each analysis will be a simple binary indicator of whether the treatment started or not during the interval analyzed.</description>

    <description>Participants will be interviewed over the phone with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Alcohol Use 7 Day Timeline Followback at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. Mixed models will be used to assess changes in symptom scores adjusting for all relevant covariates and clustering within subjects over time, within sites, and within Primary Care Providers. These changes will be defined and analyzed as the changes in PHQ-9 scores described above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to initiation of first specific treatment for depression by the primary care provider</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to initiation of first treatment will be tested using Cox regression, and logistic regression analysis will be used to determine whether the proportion of cases receiving treatment differs across study arms after controlling for all relevant covariates</description>

    <measure>Rates of depression remission, depression response, anxiety remission, anxiety response, and decrease in alcohol use to the point where it meets the guidelines for safe drinking, remaining stable, or worsening.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Cox regression (for time to remission or response) and GEE (investigating rates of remission or response for each condition as a binary outcome). The following operational definitions will be used: depression response: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score&lt;10; depression remission: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score&lt; 5; anxiety response: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7&lt; 10; anxiety remission: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7&lt; 5; at risk-drinking threshold: no more than 15 drinks per week for men with no more than 3 drinks a day most days or 10 drinks a week for women with no more than 2 drinks per day most days. A GEE model will be adjusted for each of the outcomes, using a logit link. Study site and PCP will be used to control for clustering. The models will include and explore a categorical Time effect with 4 levels (baseline, 4, 8 and 12months), study group and their interaction, as well as relevant covariates found with approaches described in the Primary and Secondary Outcomes.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be interviewed over the phone with the Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) questionnaire at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. Mixed models will be used to assess changes in scores adjusting for all relevant covariates and clustering within subjects over time, within sites, and within PCP. These changes will be defined and analyzed as the changes in PHQ-9 scores described above with thee scores for the three main conditions (PHQ-9, GAD-7 and 7 Day Timeline Followback) entered as control variables.</description>
