  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomly placed in five groups: (1) single exposure at 5°C in cold water
      immersion, (2) single exposure at 15°C in cold water immersion, (3) multiple exposures at
      10°C in cold water immersion, (4) whole body cryotherapy (WBC) at 110°C and (5) passive
      recovery (control group). The single exposure groups performed cold water immersion
      immediately after exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) for 20 minutes. The multiple
      exposures group performed cold water immersion immediately, 24h, 48h and 72h after EIMD (once
      a day) for 20 minutes. The WBC group remained in the cabin immediately after EIMD for 3 min.
      The control group was not exposed to treatment after the EIMD protocol. The subjects were
      asked to visit the laboratory on seven occasions. The first visit was the familiarization of
      the subjects with experimental procedures and their anthropometric assessment. One week after
      familiarization, on visit two, volunteers performed the exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD)
      protocol and they were allocated to one of experimental groups. Indirect markers of muscle
      damage and inflammatory responses were evaluated at baseline (pre), immediately post, 24h,
      48h, 72h, 96h, and 168h following the EIMD protocol by measuring anterior thigh muscle
      swelling, isometric knee extensors peak torque, knee extensors muscle soreness,
      countermovement vertical jump and blood sample analyzes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To avoid circadian influences, subjects were asked to visit the laboratory always at the same
      time of day. Volunteers were asked to not perform any vigorous physical activities or
      unaccustomed exercise during the experiment period. In addition, they were instructed not to
      intake medications or supplements during the study.
