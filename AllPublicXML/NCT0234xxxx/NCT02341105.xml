    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of low-dose amiodarone therapy versus catheter ablation (CA) in older
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

      Primary Objective: To compare amiodarone to catheter ablation in patients aged 50 to 80 years
      with symptomatic AF for the composite outcome of hospitalization for cardiovascular cause or
      emergency department visit for atrial arrhythmia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre vanguard phase prospective randomized open label study with blinded
      outcome adjudication.

      Patients will be randomized by a central randomization system (1:1) to amiodarone or catheter
      ablation.

        1. Amiodarone will be started at a dose of 400 mg/day. After one month the dose will be
           lowered to 200 mg per day. Patients will be seen every six months. At each visit the
           dose of amiodarone will be lowered by 100 mg per week if the patient is having a good
           clinical response to treatment. Good clinical response will be a a clinical assessment
           that takes into account not only actual or possible arrhythmia recurrence but also
           side-effects and patient acceptability of treatment. A minimum dose of 700 mg/week will
           be allowed. If patient symptoms recur, the amiodarone dose may be increased but not
           above a dose of 200 mg/day .

        2. Catheter ablation of persistent AF will be done within two months using pulmonary vein
           isolation in all subjects

        3. Patient not in sinus rhythm at time randomization will undergo DC cardioversion after at
           least 1 month of amiodarone Rx or during CA.

      Follow up: Clinical assessment will include a medical history and physical examination to be
      performed at baseline, and every 3 months. This will also include 12-lead ECG.

      b. At 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months: QOL questionnaire (AFEQT- Atrial Fibrillation Effect on
      QualiTy of life) c. Thyroid and liver function tests, chest X-ray will be obtained at regular
      intervals.

      d. Arrhythmia will be monitored using a 2-week event monitors at 6, 12, 18, 24 months.

    <description>Known potential side effects of catheter ablation include vascular access complications such as hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula. Less common but more serious include cardiac perforation (0.5%-1%) and thromboembolism (0.5%-1%), and fatal complications occur in approximately 1:1000 cases.
Known potential side effects of amiodarone include amiodarone toxicity, corneal micro-deposits, photosensitivity, thyroid abnormalities. pulmonary toxicity, abnormal liver function, and skin discolouration.</description>
