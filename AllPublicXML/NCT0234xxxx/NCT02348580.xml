  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses experimental methods to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational
      intervention in Rwanda. The intervention, designed by Aflatoun and AMIR, involves training
      teachers on the use of active-learning methods to implement a social and financial education
      curriculum with students in primary and secondary schools. Teachers then implement the social
      and financial curriculum with students in order to improve their personal, social, and
      financial competencies.

      Teacher training will take place in November-December 2013 and the curriculum implementation
      will be evaluated in the 2014 school year.

      The study will examine the following hypotheses:

        1. Did teachers use of active learning methods in class increase due to the training
           received?

        2. Did students' levels of engagement and on-task behaviour increase as a result of the
           intervention's pedagogy and content?

        3. Did the following competencies of students improve due to the intervention?

             1. Self-efficacy

             2. Social skills

             3. Financial literacy

             4. Planning attitudes

             5. Savings attitudes

             6. Savings behavior

             7. Entrepreneurship

        4. Did the intervention change student's pass rates on the primary six (P6) and secondary
           three (S3) final examinations for the classes in which it was implemented?

        5. Did the intervention change student drop out rates in the classes which it was
           implemented?

    <description>The intervention includes five core components: (1) personal understanding and exploration, (2) rights and responsibilities, (3) savings and spending, (4) planning and budgeting, and (5) social and financial enterprise. The training and curriculum are both manualized. The curriculum is in English and is regionally specific (for Anglophone Africa) and has been contextualized for Rwanda. The minimum hours required by Aflatoun's fidelity guide is 20 hours which includes 10 hours of curriculum lesson and 10 hours of learning activities (savings groups, social and financial projects, club activities etc).</description>
