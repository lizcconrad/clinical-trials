  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of the ExAblate
      Transcranial MRgFUS) treatment of patients with L-dopa induced dyskinesia of Parkinson's
      disease (LID PD).

      Safety:

      To evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate
      Transcranial 4000 MRgFUS treatment of dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease.

      Effectiveness:

      To determine the level of effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment of LID
      in PD patients. Efficacy will be determined utilizing clinical rating scales for dyskinesia
      (UPDRS-IV and the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale) from examinations at Baseline, 3-Months
      and 12-Months post-ExAblate treatment.
