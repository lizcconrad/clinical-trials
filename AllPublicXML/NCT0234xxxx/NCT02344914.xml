      To assess if the use of the dental support device( DSD) Laboraide™ shortens the second stage
      of labor and decreased the rate of obstetrical interventions, and if it's use alleviate pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated that a dental support device (DSD) may increase the
      isometric strength of different muscle groups (1-7). A preliminary pilot study of 32 women in
      2009 showed that DSD may shorten the second stage of labor among nulliparous women (8) by
      increasing the expulsive efforts of the parturient. The study hypothesis was that DSD may
      decrease the length of the second stage of labor and decrease the need for obstetrical
      interventions such as cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery.

      The Laboraide™ is a DSD developed specifically for use during labor. It is an inert device
      located between the jaws and does not interfere with speaking, breathing or any other oral
      activity during labor. It is a single use device, and is not transferred between women. We
      hypothesize that using this device can shorten the second stage of labor and decrease
      obstetrical intervention rate. We will also investigate it's efficiency in pain management.

Labor follow up will be documented regularly including outcome. The use of the DSD will not affect the regular management of labor according to the routine standards of the delivery suite. Following delivery, patients will be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire.</description>
