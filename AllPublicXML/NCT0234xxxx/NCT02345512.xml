  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with learning disabilities (LDs) experience high levels of health problems, including
      cerebral palsy, other problems associated with posture, movement and function, and injury
      (falls are the commonest cause of injury in this population, and poor balance/coordination
      are a contributory factor). The aim of this project is to investigate the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of lycra splinting garments (LSGs), worn to improve posture, movement and
      function, for adults (16 years and over) with LDs who fall. This project aims to investigate
      the clinical and cost effectiveness of LSGs to prevent future falls of adults with LDs, to
      inform practice and guidelines within local and national NHS adult services.

      Falls and fall injury are a serious problem for people with LDs (people with LDs experience
      similar rates of falls as the elderly in the general population but at a younger age),
      whereby interventions are warranted. Labbased 3D movement analysis will be conducted with
      adults with LDs who fall during two visits to perform simple tasks (e.g. walking) (once prior
      to being provided with LSG, and once 6 weeks after wearing the LSGs at home).

      Adults with Learning Disability who have capacity will be recruited to participate in the
      lycra splinting trial via their local physiotherapist. The eligibility criteria is an adult
      with Learning Disability who has had a fall and who has problems with their balance and/or
      gait as identified by their local physiotherapist.

      The participants will be recruited via participant information sheets. The participants will
      attend the Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) gait laboratory to undertake 3D movement
      analysis; Gaitrite test; and Central Pressure testing.

      This will take place before prescription of a lycra splinting garment and a minimum of 6
      weeks wear after receiving a lycra splinting garment.

      Analysis of data captured before and after wearing the lycra splinting garment will take
      place.

      The useability of the lycra splinting garment will also be determined by completion of a user
      and carer questionnaire and by completion of a questionnaire by their local physiotherapist.

      The cost effectiveness of lycra splinting garments will be analysed vis a health statistician
      within GCU.
