  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fibre-reinforced composite resin
      restorations are effective for single tooth replacement, elimination of tooth mobility
      following periodontal treatment and as an orthodontic retainer.

    <textblock>
      Adhesive dentistry is based on preventive dental approach. In presence of such advanced and
      minimally invasive techniques, destructive treatment methods should not be preferred for
      clinical situations, such as missing single tooth cases, tooth mobility following periodontal
      treatment and prevention of relapse after orthodontic treatments. Glass fibre is a
      reinforcement material, and increases the flexibility of the material together which it has
      been used. Fibre-reinforced applications by using direct or indirect techniques. This
      material and method is easily applicable, biocompatible, repairable and economical on a high
      extent.
