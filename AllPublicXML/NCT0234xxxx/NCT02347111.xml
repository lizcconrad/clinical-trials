    <textblock>
      In this pilot and feasibility study, the investigators will enroll patients with frequent
      symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a cross-over study testing two different
      classes of anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs). This pilot and feasibility study will provide
      preliminary data for a larger study in which the investigators will test the hypothesis that
      a common AF genetic risk allele modulates response to different AADs.

      1.0 Background

      While atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia requiring
      therapy, it is also associated with increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial
      infarction, dementia, and death. The number of Americans affected with AF is expected to
      surge to nearly 16 million by the year 2050. The AF epidemic may in part be related to the
      aging of the population and increasing prevalence of recently identified risk factors
      including obesity, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and inflammation.
      Furthermore, there is increasing support for the idea that both common and rare genetic
      variants also increase susceptibility to AF which can clinically manifest in the presence of
      acquired risk factors. While clinical risk factors for AF are established, the genetic
      components of this &quot;multiple-hit&quot; genetic model for the development of AF have only recently
      been identified.

      Despite recent advances in catheter-based and surgical therapies, anti-arrhythmic drugs
      (AADs) remain the mainstay of treatment for patients with symptomatic AF. However, response
      in an individual is highly variable with more than half of patients treated with AADs
      suffering a recurrence of AF within 6 to 12 months. The limited success of therapy for AF is
      related to poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, heterogeneity of the
      electrical and structural substrate, and the lack of targeted mechanism-based therapies.
      Thus, one major knowledge gap is predicting response to AADs in an individual patient.
      Contemporary membrane-active drugs used to suppress AF are incompletely and unpredictably
      effective and are associated with significant risks of proarrhythmia and non-cardiac
      toxicities. Furthermore, the current 'one-size fits all' approach to selecting AAD therapy
      for a patient with symptomatic AF is based largely on minimizing the risk of adverse events
      rather than on the likelihood of efficacy. Recent advances in our understanding of genetic
      mechanisms of AF support the overarching hypothesis we wish to test in future studies that
      variability in response to AAD therapy is modulated by common genetic variants associated
      with AF. Several AF susceptibility loci have been identified and validated in genome-wide
      association studies. In addition, we have shown that common AF risk single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) at the chromosome (chr) 4q25 locus not only predict poor response to
      AADs but also recurrence of AF after ablation therapy and cardioversion.

      While genetic approaches to AF have revealed that susceptibility to AF and response to
      therapy are modulated in part by the underlying genetic substrate, the translation of these
      discoveries to the bedside management of AF patients has thus far been limited. This relates
      to poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with common AF risk alleles,
      challenges associated with determining efficacy of AADs and lack of genotype-directed
      prospective studies. Our preliminary data showed that a common chr4q25 SNP associated with AF
      predicted successful symptom control in patients treated with AADs and individuals who
      carried the risk variant responded better to Vaughan Williams class I vs. class III AADs.
      Based on the information collected in this feasibility and pilot study, we propose to conduct
      a prospective pharmacogenomic study where a cohort of patients with frequent symptomatic
      paroxysmal AF will be randomized to a flecainide (class I AAD) or sotalol (class III AAD) in
      order to determine if response to therapy is modified by chr4q25 SNPs using AF burden as a
      metric of drug efficacy. This main study, like the pilot study proposed here, will utilize a
      crossover design to minimize inter-individual variability and maximize statistical power to
      detect an interaction between chr4q25 genotype and the reduction of AF burden with flecainide
      vs. sotalol. After a run-in period during which the AAD will be up-titrated, subjects will be
      monitored with the Medtronic Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) system to assess AF
      burden. Furthermore, subjects will be asked to complete a comprehensive, validated 20-item AF
      specific questionnaire (AF Effect on QualiTy-of-life [AFEQT]) at baseline, and monthly
      thereafter for the duration of the study. At the end of the 3-month trial period, the AAD
      will be discontinued and participants will be switched to the other AAD and followed for
      another 3-month period in a crossover trial design.

      2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims

      We and others have shown common SNPs at the chr4q25 locus are associated with increased risk
      of AF and modulate symptomatic response to AADs. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggests
      that there is a differential response to class I vs. class III membrane-active drugs. Here,
      we propose a pilot study to obtain preliminary data regarding AF burden in patients receiving
      AADs and to demonstrate feasibility for a future study to test the hypothesis that chr4q25
      risk SNPs modulate differential response to AADs in patients with frequent symptomatic
      paroxysmal AF using reduction in mean AF burden as a metric of drug efficacy. Therefore, the
      Specific Aim of this pilot/feasibility study is to obtain preliminary data regarding AF
      burden in patients receiving AADs and to demonstrate feasibility for a future study to test
      the hypothesis that chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response to class I vs. class III AADs
      in patients with frequent symptomatic AF.

      3.0 Previous Human Studies

      Chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response to AADs in patients with AF In a preliminary
      study we addressed whether symptomatic response to AAD therapy is modulated by the 3 common
      AF susceptibility loci on chr4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3). We
      studied 478 (discovery cohort) and 198 (validation cohort) age and gender matched Caucasian
      patients in the Vanderbilt AF Registry. Response to AAD therapy was defined as successful
      rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with
      ≥ 75% reduction in AF symptoms. Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension,
      lone AF) failed to predict response to AADs. However, a SNP at the 4q25 locus (rs10033464)
      was significantly associated with successful symptom control (odds ratio [OR] 2.97, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 1.42-6.21, P=0.003). Furthermore, individuals who carried the 4q25
      SNP responded better to class I vs. class III AADs in both the discovery and validation
      cohorts. These preliminary findings provide the rationale for our future studies by
      suggesting that common AF susceptibility variants differentially modify the response to class
      I vs. class III AADs in patients with frequent symptomatic AF.

      5.0 Enrollment/Randomization

      Patients ≥18 years of age with symptomatic paroxysmal AF will be enrolled from the Arrhythmia
      and Cardiology Clinics, the Adult Emergency Department, and inpatient Cardiology services at
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center. For patients with whom researchers do not have a
      relationship, introductions from a member of their care team will be sought prior to
      discussion of the study. After obtaining the permission of the patient, a member of the study
      team will explain the study, answer any questions, and allow sufficient time to be certain
      that the subject understands the study and has given their consent to participate. Consent
      will be documented by signing the informed consent document, a copy of which will be given to
      the subject. For this pilot and feasibility study, we plan to recruit a total of 10 patients
      with a target enrollment of 1-2 patients monthly.

      6.0 Study Procedures

      Randomization: Patients will be treated with either flecainide or sotalol for 3 months and
      then cross over to the alternate drug for 3 months. The order of assignment will be randomly
      assigned using a permuted block design with alternate block sizes of 2 and 4 subjects. The
      randomization list will be generated by the PI and provided to the Investigational Drug
      Service (IDS) pharmacy. The study will be open-label.

      Baseline visit procedures: The baseline visit will take place at the Vanderbilt Clinical
      Research Center (CRC). Patients will present to the CRC and be met by a study physician, who
      will perform a history and physical exam. The CRC nurse will draw 30 ml of blood for DNA
      extraction and subsequent genotyping. Plasma will be stored at -70 degrees C for future
      studies. Blood will be sent to the Vanderbilt inpatient laboratory for analysis of the basic
      metabolic panel. A baseline 12-lead ECG will be obtained for all patients and interpreted at
      the bedside by the study physician. For patients randomized to start sotalol first, a
      peripheral intravenous catheter will be placed. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      confirmed, the patient will receive his/her first dose of study medication (sotalol 120 mg by
      mouth or flecainide 50 mg by mouth), which will be dispensed by the IDS and given to the
      patient. Per routine clinical practice, patients initiating flecainide will also be started
      on atenolol (25 mg by mouth daily) or diltiazem (120 mg long-acting by mouth daily) if the
      patient has contraindications to β-blockers to prevent the development of 1:1 conducted
      atrial flutter.

      Two hours after the first dose of study drug is given a 12-lead ECG will be recorded and
      interpreted by the study physician. For patients initiating flecainide the PR interval and
      QRS duration will be carefully scrutinized. If these remain unchanged, the patient will be
      discharged from the CRC. For patients initiating sotalol, the QTc will be examined. If the
      duration is &gt;500 ms, the sotalol dose will be reduced to 80 mg by mouth twice daily. Patients
      initiating sotalol will be admitted for continuous telemetric monitoring and will remain in
      the CRC until after the 5th dose is administered. Additional 12-lead ECGs will be obtained
      two hours after the 3rd and 5th doses of sotalol to assess QTc. If the duration remains &gt;500
      ms on the reduced (80 mg) dose of sotalol, the drug will be stopped and the patient will be
      removed from the study. If the QTc remains ≤500 ms after the 5th dose of sotalol, the patient
      will be discharged from the CRC.

      A study physician who has undergone specific training will insert the Medtronic Reveal LINQ
      ICM according to manufacturer instructions in the CRC. The device will be inserted on day 1.
      Briefly, using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a very small (6 to 8 mm) skin incision
      is made over the left chest. The ICM, which is approximately cylindrical and measures roughly
      2 cm long and 5 mm in diameter, is inserted using a proprietary insertion tool and a sterile
      dressing is applied at the end of the procedure. The device will be programmed to optimize
      the memory for storing AF episodes. &quot;AF-only mode&quot; will be activated and programmed to &quot;All
      episodes&quot; to ensure that the shortest possible AF episodes are detected and stored in the
      device memory. The patients will be taught how to perform a CareLink transmission using the
      small handheld &quot;Patient Assistant&quot; device. Medtronic personnel will be on hand to aid in the
      insertion and initial programing of the ICM as well as patient education with the Patient
      Assistant device.

      For patients initiating sotalol, no further dose adjustments will be planned after discharge
      from the CRC. Patients initiating flecainide will be contacted by telephone 3 to 4 days after
      initiation and, if they are tolerating the medication, will be instructed to increase their
      dose to 100 mg twice daily.

      One-week follow-up visit: All patients will return for a brief visit in the CRC 1 week after
      ICM insertion for a wound check and to obtain a 12-lead ECG. A study physician will perform a
      brief focused history to assess medication tolerance and compliance. A pill count will be
      performed to further assess compliance. Barring any ECG abnormalities or clinical side
      effects, patients initiating flecainide will be instructed to increase the dose to the final
      dose of 150 mg twice daily.

      Three-month follow-up visit and crossover procedures: Patients will be scheduled to return to
      the CRC 3 months after study entry. Once a visit is confirmed, each patient will be asked to
      stop his or her current AAD 5 half-lives (approximately 60 hours) prior to arrival to the
      CRC. Patients initially taking flecainide will also stop their AV nodal blocker (atenolol or
      diltiazem) at this time. Patients will then present to the CRC and undergo initiation of the
      alternative drug using the same procedures that were used at the baseline study visit, with
      the exception of the ICM insertion. A full interrogation of the ICM will be performed. A pill
      count will be performed to further assess compliance. Patients crossing over to flecainide
      will be discharged from the CRC after a 2 hour 12-lead ECG is obtained and interpreted as
      normal. Patients initiating sotalol will remain in the CRC for loading and continuous
      telemetric monitoring. All patients will be scheduled for a brief follow-up visit in the CRC
      one week after crossover to assess for medication compliance and tolerance and for final
      titration of flecainide.

      Quality of life assessment: Patients will be asked to fill out the AFEQT quality of life
      questionnaire at baseline and at the end of each month of the study. The questionnaire at the
      end of the 3rd month will be administered just prior to stopping the first study drug. The
      validated questionnaire is comprised of 20 questions about AF symptoms with answers given on
      a Likert scale. The questionnaire will be provided to the patients in paper format either in
      person or by mail, as applicable. A follow-up phone call will be made to each patient to
      ensure that the questionnaire is completed and returned.

      End of study procedures: Patients will be scheduled for a clinic visit with their primary
      cardiac electrophysiologist to coincide with the termination of the study (6 months). A study
      physician will also be available to conduct a brief patient interview, pill count, and ICM
      interrogation. All pertinent clinical data including AF burden on each AAD, maximal tolerated
      dose, and any reported side effects will be given to the primary cardiac electrophysiologist
      to aide in clinical decision making about future AAD treatment.

      Early study termination, early crossover, and procedures to treat persistent AF: Based on our
      prior clinical experience, a proportion of patients (20 to 30%) are expected to experience
      residual symptomatic episodes of AF while taking either or both study AADs. Usually these
      episodes will be less bothersome or lengthy. Patients will be encouraged to continue the
      study protocol if possible. However, a smaller proportion of patients might have intolerable
      symptoms necessitating an unscheduled change in therapy. The study team will work with the
      primary cardiac electrophysiologist to facilitate any necessary change in therapy. An early
      crossover to the alternative study AAD will be encouraged over a change to a non-study AAD
      when possible. A change in therapy to a non-study AAD or AF ablation procedure will be
      allowed when necessary. In addition, if patients acquire persistent AF during the course of
      the study, direct current cardioversion will be allowed and will be coordinated by the study
      team and the primary cardiac electrophysiologist. AF burden data for patients deviating from
      the study protocol will be analyzed using an &quot;on treatment&quot; analysis. In other words, the AF
      burden will be calculated per day that patients are on each study AAD. Patients will also be
      allowed to withdraw from the study for personal or other reasons at any time.

      Insertable cardiac monitor management after study termination: At the conclusion of the
      six-month study, patients will be given the option to remove or retain the ICM. We anticipate
      that most patients and their primary electrophysiologists will opt to retain the device to
      allow for continued cardiac monitoring, which is not only useful to gauge response to AAD
      therapy but also frequently used to monitor AF recurrence for patients undergoing catheter
      ablation. If the ICM is retained, its management, including removal, will be transferred to
      the primary electrophysiologist. Patients wishing to have the ICM removed at the end of the
      study period will be scheduled for an outpatient visit in the CRC for removal by a study
      physician.

      Primary end point and its determination: The primary endpoint will be mean AF burden over 3
      months as measured by the Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM system. All patients are scheduled to
      remain in the study for 6 months. The FDA-approved Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM system is able
      to continuously monitor the heart through a single-lead ECG and has a specific algorithm that
      detects AF by evaluating the irregularity of R-R intervals. The device is able to correctly
      classify AF in 96.1% of patients and correctly exclude AF in 97.4% of subjects. The device is
      able to monitor the heart for up to 3 years and is compatible with the Medtronic CareLink
      Network remote monitoring system. This system allows the treating physician to download
      device and diagnostic data through a secure network. Patients transmit data manually after
      the device indicates that one of the alert criteria have been met. The occurrence of symptoms
      with the AF episode will be recorded, but both asymptomatic and symptomatic AF will be
      included in the primary endpoint measurement of AF burden.

      For the primary analysis, AF burden will begin to be tabulated after an initial run in period
      for each study drug. For patients starting sotalol, the run-in period will coincide with the
      first 5 doses (60 hours). For patients starting flecainide, the run-in period will last until
      a dose of at least 200 mg per day (in divided doses) is achieved, unless a smaller dose is
      the maximally tolerated dose. Ideally, this will be achieved within 3-4 days after initiation
      of flecainide. If, during the course of the study, a patient develops persistent AF, a
      cardioversion will be scheduled in coordination with the patient's primary cardiologist or
      electrophysiologist. The patient will then be switched to the other study drug. In case of
      such an occurrence, AF burden will be tabulated using an &quot;on treatment&quot; analysis. Conditions
      for which a patient will be withdrawn from the study and data censored will be
      discontinuation of AAD therapy, initiation of amiodarone, AF ablation or AV node
      ablation/permanent pacing, loss to follow-up, elective withdrawal from the study, or death.

      Blood processing, DNA extraction, and genotyping: Blood samples will be drawn into
      ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and immediately refrigerated at 4° C. Plasma
      will be separated by centrifugation and stored at -80° C. DNA will be extracted from the
      buffy coat using a commercially available kit (Qiagen Puregene, Valencia, California) and
      stored at -20° C. Study participants will be genotyped for three common chr4q25 SNPs
      (rs2200733, rs17570669, and rs3853445) using Sanger sequencing.

      7.0 Risks

      Risks will be minimized by performing study procedures in the Vanderbilt CRC. A complete
      history and physical examination will be performed to ensure that subjects fulfill the entry
      criteria as defined. All identifying documents, data, and specimens collected as a result of
      this study will be retained by the investigator. Data will be entered into the secure
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. Access to this material will be available
      only to the research investigator and his staff. If results of this study are to be
      published, only code numbers will be used for identification purposes. Participants will not
      be identified by name.

      Risks associated with the Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM: Risks associated with insertion of the
      ICM include pain and discomfort, bleeding, bruising, hematoma, infection, and an allergic
      reaction to the skin prep or lidocaine used for local anesthesia. There is a very small risk
      of long-term discomfort associated with having the device. According to the manufacturer, the
      ICM is fully MRI-compatible immediately after implantation.

      Risks associated with sotalol: Therapeutic doses of sotalol range from 160 mg to 240 mg per
      day. Common side effects of sotalol therapy include bradycardia (13% to 16%), chest pain (3%
      to 16%), palpitations (14%), fatigue (20%), dizziness (20%), lightheadedness (12%), weakness
      (13%), dyspnea (21%), edema (8%), hypotension (6%), proarrhythmia (5%), syncope (5%), heart

      (2%). Rare (&lt; 1%) side effects of therapeutic doses of sotalol include alopecia,
      bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia (BOOP), cold extremities, diaphoresis,
      eosinophilia, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, leukopenia, paralysis, phlebitis, photosensitivity
      reaction, pruritus, pulmonary edema, Raynaud's phenomenon, red crusted skin, retroperitoneal
      fibrosis, elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and vertigo.

      Risks associated with flecainide: Therapeutic doses of flecainide range from 200 mg to 300 mg
      per day. Common side effects of flecainide therapy include dizziness (19% to 30%), visual
      disturbances (16%), dyspnea (10%), palpitations (6%), chest pain (5%), edema (3.5%),

      exfoliative dermatitis, granulocytopenia, heart block, increased PR interval, leukopenia,
      metallic taste, neuropathy, paradoxical increase in ventricular rate in atrial
      fibrillation/flutter, paresthesia, photophobia, pneumonitis, pruritus, increased QRS
      duration, swollen lips/tongue/mouth, tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia, urinary retention,
      urticaria, and ventricular arrhythmias.

      Risks associated with oral atenolol use: Therapeutic dose of atenolol ranges from 50 mg to
      200 mg per day. Common side effects of chronic atenolol therapy include tiredness (26%),
      dizziness (13%), depression (12%), cold, tingling, or numbness in the hands or feet (12%),
      and shortness of breath (6%). Other common adverse effects of atenolol include slow heart
      rate (bradycardia), a decrease in blood pressure when going from a lying-down or sitting
      position to standing, a spinning sensation (vertigo), lightheadedness, diarrhea, and nausea.
      We will use a low dose of atenolol (25 mg) in this study to minimize the risk of occurrence
      of these adverse effects. Rare (&lt; 1%) side effects of therapeutic doses of atenolol include
      an increase in liver enzymes, allergic reactions, headache, impotence (also known as erectile
      dysfunction), Peyronie's disease, worsening of psoriasis, reversible hair loss, vision
      problems, dry mouth, Raynaud's phenomenon, unexplained rash, and dry eyes. These adverse
      effects are not anticipated with a single low dose of atenolol that will be administered to
      our volunteers.

      Atenolol can rarely cause an allergic reaction (&lt;1%) that manifests as rash, itching,
      swelling, severe dizziness, or trouble breathing. Any subject with a previous history of
      allergy or intolerance to beta-blockers will be excluded from the study.

      Risks associated with oral diltiazem use: The therapeutic dose of diltiazem ranges from 120
      mg to 480 mg per day. Common side effects of chronic diltiazem therapy include edema (2% to
      15%), headache (5% to 12%), AV block (first degree 2% to 8%), bradycardia (2% to 6%),
      hypotension (2% to 4%), vasodilation (2% to 3%), extrasystoles (2%), flushing (1% to 2%),
      palpitation (1% to 2%), dizziness (3% to 10%), nervousness (2%), rash (1% to 4%), gout (1% to
      2%), dyspepsia (1% to 6%), constipation (&lt;2% to 4%), vomiting (2%), diarrhea (1% to 2%),
      weakness (1% to 4%), myalgia (2%), rhinitis (&lt;2% to 10%), pharyngitis (2% to 6%), dyspnea (1%
      to 6%), bronchitis (1% to 4%), cough (≤3), and sinus congestion (1% to 2%). Rare (&lt; 1%) side
      effects of diltiazem include an increase in alkaline phosphatase, allergic reaction, increase
      in liver transaminases, amblyopia, amnesia, arrhythmia, AV block (second or third degree),
      bundle branch block, heart failure, depression, dysgeusia, extrapyramidal symptoms, gingival
      hyperplasia, hemolytic anemia, petechiae, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
      syncope, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, tremor, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

      Risks associated with venipuncture: Potential problems related to establishing an intravenous
      access include pain, bleeding, hematoma, fainting, and rarely infection at the venipuncture
      site.

      8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Participants or
      Others

      All adverse events and incidents of noncompliance with the protocol will be reported to the
      institutional review board (IRB). A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical
      occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in
      persistent or significant disability, or requires intervention to prevent permanent
      disability or death. Other untoward medical occurrences that do not meet the above criteria
      will be classified as adverse events. Study personnel who are administering the research
      protocol in the CRC will monitor for adverse events, with the assistance of the CRC nursing
      staff. All suspected or confirmed adverse events will promptly be reported to the principal
      investigator (PI), who will collect data on these occurrences. The principal investigator
      will report serious adverse events to the IRB, NIH, and any other applicable authority,
      within 10 days of the PI's knowledge of the occurrence. Non-serious adverse events and
      incidents of noncompliance with the protocol will be reported at the time of annual
      continuing review.

      9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation

      Participation in the study is strictly voluntary, and patients will be able to withdraw at
      any time. Following the subject's withdrawal, any samples collected will be destroyed and not
      analyzed further, although any analyzed data will be maintained.

      10.0 Statistical Considerations

      Sample size: This proposed pilot/feasibility study is not expected to be adequately powered
      to detect a variable response to AADs based on chr4q25 genotype. Rather, this study will
      provide vitally important and currently unavailable data on mean and standard deviation of AF
      burden during therapy with the study drugs. These data will then be used to conduct a formal
      sample size calculation for the main trial. This study will also examine the feasibility of
      the crossover design which, if feasible, will be utilized for the main trial.

      Statistical analysis: The primary study endpoint will be AF burden (the proportion of time a
      patient is in AF) and will be calculated for each patient while undergoing therapy with each
      study drug. The primary endpoint will be expressed for each study drug as median, 25th
      percentile, and 75th percentile. The difference in AF burden while on class I and class III
      AADs will be compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data. We will conduct an
      exploratory analysis using a linear regression model to detect an association between
      genotype and AF burden after adjustment for age and sex. First, we will analyze a model
      including separate terms for all three chr4q25 SNPs simultaneously with adjustment for age
      and sex. Then we will create a second model that replaces the separate chr4q25 SNP terms for
      a combined chr4q25 risk score calculated by adding the beta-coefficients for the genotypes at
      rs2200733, rs17570669, and rs3853445 found in the first model. If multivariable analysis
      demonstrates the combined chr4q25 risk score and study drug assignment are both significantly
      associated with AF burden, they will be tested for a statistical interaction to determine
      whether the chr4q25 AF susceptibility locus determines a differential response to class I and
      class III AADs. It should be emphasized that this analysis will be underpowered and
      over-fitted in this pilot/feasibility study.

      11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues

      All research hard copy records will be stored in a locked cabinet within a locked office with
      access only to the research personnel. Digitalized ECG recordings will be de-identified and
      stored in a password-protected electronic database. Blood samples will be de-identified and
      given a specific code number before storage and analysis. Only the investigators and members
      of the study team will have access to the code key.

      12.0 Follow-up and Record Retention

      We expect that the study will span a period of 12 months. All data will be archived and
      stored indefinitely.
