  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence of a potential role for cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in cardiac repair and
      the discovery of a vasoprotective axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) offer such
      breakthroughs. Investigators have observed that an imbalance in the vasoprotective axis
      {angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]/Mas receptor} and the
      vasodeleterious axis [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin II (AngII)/AngII type 1
      receptor (AT1R)] of the RAS within the CPCs affects their functionality and regenerative
      potential. Investigators believe that restoring the balance between these two axes of the RAS
      is essential to improve CPC function and enhance their reparative capabilities. These
      observations have led to the hypothesis that genetic modification of CPCs by overexpression
      of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) will enhance their reparative function and improve their potential to
      attenuate myocardial ischemia-induced cardiac damage.

      As a participant undergoes a clinically indicated heart transplant, or a left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) implantation, or a right heart biopsy, or atrial fibrillation surgery,
      or right atria cannulation, the following tissue samples will be collected:

      In the subjects undergoing orthotopic heart transplant (n=20), failed myocardial tissue
      samples will be collected from the diseased heart.

      For subjects undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation (n=60), small samples
      will be collected from the apex core (that would be routinely discarded at the time of the
      implantation procedure).

      For heart transplant subjects undergoing clinically indicated right heart biopsy (n=20), the
      collection of multiple samples including, excess myocardial biopsy samples that will not be
      utilized by pathology.

      For subjects undergoing any heart surgery (n=80), the collection of left atrial appendages
      that are routinely removed to prevent thrombosis during atrial fibrillation surgery and a
      piece of the right atria will be cut in order to implant the cannula.

      In addition, a collection of 20ml (about one tablespoon) of blood will be taken from all
      subjects to analyze progenitor/inflammatory cells and inflammation cytokines and pertinent
      medical history.
