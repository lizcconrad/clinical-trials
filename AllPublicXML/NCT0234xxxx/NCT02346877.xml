      This study will evaluate whether the effect of personalized patient counselling tool,
      Information-Motivation-Strategy (IMS) based on the results of the Beliefs about Medicines
      Questionnaire (BMQ) will improve persistence of Enbrel (etanercept) therapy at week 52 in
      subjects with rheumatoid arthritis over the historical control as estimated by the standard
      of care.

    <measure>Persistence of Study Drug Measured at 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A participant is persistent if the date of the last prescription filled plus the number of weeks supply of the prescription is greater than or equal to 52 weeks from enrolment and the eDiary confirms Enbrel® from the prescription was injected. A participant is not persistent if the last prescription filled plus the number of weeks supply of the prescription is less than 52 weeks from enrolment and the eDiary confirms there was no injection of Enbrel®, or, a participant is not persistent if the participant has a gap in treatment of more than 4 consecutive weeks for no medical reason at any time in the 52 week study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Study Drug up to 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A participant's adherence is determined as a medication possession ratio (MPR) of at least 80%. The MPR is the ratio of the total number of weeks' supply, based on pharmacy data, of Enbrel® divided by either 52 weeks or duration on study if a physician stops prescribing Enbrel® due to an adverse drug reaction or lack of efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BMQ consists of two five-item scales assessing patients' beliefs about the necessity of Enbrel® for controlling their rheumatoid arthritis and their concerns about potential adverse consequences of taking Enbrel®. Using a five-point Likert scale, on each of necessity and concerns, the individual items within both scales are summed. The total scores for the Necessity and Concerns Scales range from 5 to 25. Higher scores indicate stronger beliefs.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were to be enrolled in the standard of care (control) cohort and complete the 52-week study period. Data from 75% of the group were to be analyzed before enrolling participants in the interventional cohort. As the study was prematurely closed due to slow enrollment, the interventional cohort was not enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Persistence of Study Drug Measured at 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>A participant is persistent if the date of the last prescription filled plus the number of weeks supply of the prescription is greater than or equal to 52 weeks from enrolment and the eDiary confirms Enbrel® from the prescription was injected. A participant is not persistent if the last prescription filled plus the number of weeks supply of the prescription is less than 52 weeks from enrolment and the eDiary confirms there was no injection of Enbrel®, or, a participant is not persistent if the participant has a gap in treatment of more than 4 consecutive weeks for no medical reason at any time in the 52 week study period.</description>

        <title>Adherence to Study Drug up to 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>A participant’s adherence is determined as a medication possession ratio (MPR) of at least 80%. The MPR is the ratio of the total number of weeks’ supply, based on pharmacy data, of Enbrel® divided by either 52 weeks or duration on study if a physician stops prescribing Enbrel® due to an adverse drug reaction or lack of efficacy.</description>

        <title>Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)</title>
        <description>BMQ consists of two five-item scales assessing patients’ beliefs about the necessity of Enbrel® for controlling their rheumatoid arthritis and their concerns about potential adverse consequences of taking Enbrel®. Using a five-point Likert scale, on each of necessity and concerns, the individual items within both scales are summed. The total scores for the Necessity and Concerns Scales range from 5 to 25. Higher scores indicate stronger beliefs.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
