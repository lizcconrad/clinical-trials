    <textblock>
      As the loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with a dysregulation of muscle protein
      synthesis (MPS) that is generally characterized by an 'anabolic resistance' to nutrients, the
      primary outcome of the trial is to investigate the effect of a mixed macronutrient beverage
      on post-prandial myofibrillar MPS. However, the 'anabolic resistance' of aging may be
      predominantly influenced by the contractile activity of skeletal muscle; for example, the
      investigators have demonstrated that 2 weeks of reduced habitual activity (i.e. daily step
      count) induces anabolic resistance in otherwise healthy older adults. In contrast, resistance
      exercise is well-known to enhance muscle mass and can increase the sensitivity of skeletal
      muscle to dietary amino acids. Therefore, all participants will undergo a 2-week reduced step
      count intervention combined with a unilateral leg resistance exercise protocol to induce an
      'unhealthy' or 'anabolically resistant' leg and a relatively 'healthy' or 'anabolically
      sensitive' leg, respectively; this within subject model will be utilized to investigate the
      effect of the mixed macronutrient beverage in both relatively 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' older
      muscle. The investigators will also measure changes in muscle mass, muscle function, and
      cardiovascular health of both legs before and after the 2-week intervention to determine the
      effect of reduced activity and the protective effect of minimal, low-intensity exercise on
      these outcomes.
