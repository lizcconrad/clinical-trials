  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how a new tracer named 18F-MFBG (Meta Fluorobenzyl
      Guanidine) behaves in the body after injection, how it spreads to all the organs and how it
      is removed from the body. We will also study how long 18F-MFBG lasts in the blood after
      administered. In addition we want to study if 18F-MFBG can show Neuroendocrine tumors on a
      PET-CT scan.

    <intervention_model_description>For phase I, a single dose of 18F-MFBG will be injected intravenously in patients. For all patients, pharmacokinetics and bio distribution will be evaluated using non invasive PET scanning and blood assays at multiple time points post injection. In the expansion phase, a single dose of 18F-MFBG will be injected intravenously followed by a single time point imaging using PET MR scanner (PET/CT if scan cannot be performed on PET/MR for technical reasons).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Multiple samples will be counted and time activity curve generated for evaluation of serum clearance. Blood samples will be centrifuged and the plasma pipetted, weighed and counted to determine the plasma time activity concentration curves (% injected dose/liter), as well as for metabolite analysis of the 18F-MFBG compound by HPLC and/or TCA methodology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>18 F-MFBG imaging PET/CT to target known sites of disease</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion detection will be evaluated based on per patient and per lesion basis. The segmental distribution method described for 123 I -MIBG imaging (modified curie scoring system will be used- appendix C). If, for each individual patient, there is a concordance of ≥70% of segments or lesion detection between MIBG and 18 F-MFBG , the latter will be considered as effectively targeting lesions. For discordant lesions, if MFBG imaging shows 2 or more lesions that are positive on other concurrent or follow up conventional imaging, it will be considered optimal targeting.</description>

For all patients, pharmacokinetics and bio distribution will be evaluated using non invasive PET scanning and blood assays at multiple time points post injection. In the expansion phase, a single dose of 18F-MFBG will be injected intravenously followed by a single time point imaging using PET MR scanner (PET/CT if scan cannot be performed on PET/MR for technical reasons). In expansion cohort, an additional 50 patients with NB will be imaged. Patients will receive a single dose of 18F-MFBG intravenously, followed by a whole body PET scan on PET/CT or PET/CT scanner at 60-90 minutes post injection. All patients will be imaged on PET/MR scanner unless technical reasons (claustrophobia, patient refusal, technical difficulty with PET MR) prevents imaging on PET/MR in which case, patients will be imaged on PET CT scanner.</description>

             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
