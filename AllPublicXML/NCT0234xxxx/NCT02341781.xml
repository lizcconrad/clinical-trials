  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of lenalidomide in subjects
      with relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) following ibrutinib treatment. MCL
      subjects who require treatment after receiving ibrutinib therapy are considered a population
      with high unmet medical need. It is therefore of benefit to have data on the outcomes of
      treatment options available in this patient population.

      An observational study design was chosen to collect the clinical data already existing or
      being collected for MCL subjects being treated with lenalidomide.

      MCL subjects who received lenalidomide either as monotherapy or as combination treatment
      after having relapsed or progressed on ibrutinib treatment or were refractory or intolerant
      to ibrutinib treatment are eligible for the study. Lenalidomide does not need to be the next
      subsequent treatment after ibrutinib.

        Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) subjects who received lenalidomide, either as monotherapy or as
        combination treatment, after having relapsed or progressed on ibrutinib treatment or were
        refractory or intolerant to ibrutinib treatment.

        Lenalidomide does not need to be the next subsequent treatment after ibrutinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document (ICD), if applicable,
             prior to any collection of study-related data.

          2. Males or females ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICD (if informed consent
             is applicable)

          3. Diagnosis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) as assessed by the investigator. A copy of a
             pathology report establishing the diagnosis of MCL must be available

          4. Must have received at least one dose of ibrutinib and must have met at least one of
             the following criteria:

        A. Relapse: Subjects with relapse following initial response of CR to ibrutinib (or an
        ibrutinib-containing regimen). Subjects may have discontinued or completed ibrutinib
        treatment at the time of relapse, and there is no upper limit on the time between the last
        dose of ibrutinib to time of relapse. B. Progressive disease (PD): Subjects with PD
        following initial response of PR to ibrutinib (or an ibrutinib-containing regimen).
        Subjects may have discontinued or completed ibrutinib at the time of progression, and there
        is no upper limit on the time between the last dose of ibrutinib to time of progression. C.
        Refractoriness: Subjects with i. Best response of stable disease (SD) during treatment with
        ibrutinib (or an ibrutinib-containing regimen), and then subsequently had PD, or ii. Best
        response of PD at anytime while on ibrutinib (or an ibrutinib-containing regimen) D.
        Intolerance: Subjects requiring premature discontinuation of ibrutinib for reasons other
        than PD prior to the planned end of treatment. Potential reasons for premature
        discontinuation may include Adverse Event (AE) attributed to ibrutinib or inability to
        continue ibrutinib for other reasons. Subjects responding to ibrutinib treatment must have
        documented PD/relapse following discontinuation of ibrutinib. The reason for the premature
        discontinuation of ibrutinib will be recorded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  no exclusion criteria.
