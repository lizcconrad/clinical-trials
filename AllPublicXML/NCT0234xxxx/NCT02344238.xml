  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pharmacotherapy trials in drug-dependent populations, medication compliance is a
      significant issue, as rates tend to be low and adherence to medication may predict improved
      outcomes (Baros et al, 2007; McRae et al, 2004; O'Brien et al, 1996; Somoza et al., 2010).
      However, methods commonly used to determine compliance may result in inaccurate measurement
      of adherence. It is therefore essential to develop measurement systems that not only
      accurately and objectively measure compliance, but can also have the potential to increase
      compliance in difficult to treat disorders such as addiction. In this study, we propose to
      assess the acceptability, tolerability, and efficacy of the ID-Cap, a novel compliance
      measurement device, in a healthy population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability,
      and efficacy of the ID-Cap in a healthy population.

      Participation in the study takes 10 visits over a period of approximately five weeks. The
      first visit is a screening visit to determine if participants are eligible to participate.
      After inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized into one of three groups.
      Participants randomized to Group 1 will have compliance measured by patient reports and
      riboflavin measurement. Participants randomized to Group 2 will have compliance measured by
      patient reports, riboflavin measurement, and data collected by the e-Tect reader.
      Participants randomized to Group 3 will also have compliance measured by patient reports,
      riboflavin measurement, and data collected by the e-Tect reader. However, participants
      randomized to this group will also receive reminder calls and/or text messages to ingest the
      study medication if a signal is not sent from the e-Tect reader to the study team within one
      hour of the scheduled medication administration time.

      After the initial screening visit, participants will present to the clinic twice weekly to
      complete self-reports of compliance, provide urine samples for riboflavin assessment, and be
      assessed for adverse effects.

      They will also be asked to attend one follow-up visit to include abdominal x-ray in order to
      confirm passage of the capsules.
