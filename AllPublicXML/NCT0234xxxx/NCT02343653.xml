  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate the effect of strength training on muscle strength, muscle mass
      and nutritional status in patients with liver cirrhosis to clarify possible metabolic and
      inflammatory changes during this intervention. In addition the investigator examine if the
      intervention is associated with fewer hospital readmission and an improved quality of life.
