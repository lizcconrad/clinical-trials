      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BBB disruption using transcranial
      MRI-guided focused ultrasound in conjunction with an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent to
      increase the accumulation of doxorubicin in brain tumours and the adjacent brain using the
      ExAblate Transcranial system (220 kHz). Data will be collected to establish the basic safety
      of this type of treatment as the basis for later studies to evaluate its clinical efficacy.

          -  Able to attend all study visits (i.e., life expectancy of at least 3 months).

          -  At least 14 days passed since last brain surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The sonication pathway to the tumour involves:

             i. More than 30% of the skull area traversed by the sonication pathway is covered by
             scars, scalp disorders (e.g., eczema), or atrophy of the scalp ii. Clips or other
             metallic implanted objects in the skull or the brain, except shunts

          -  The subject presents with symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g.,
             headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and papilledema)

          -  Cardiac disease or unstable hemodynamics including:

             i. Documented myocardial infarction within six months of enrolment ii. Unstable angina
             on medication iii. Congestive heart failure iv. Left ventricular ejection fraction
             below the lower limit of normal v. History of a hemodynamically unstable cardiac
             arrythmia vi. Cardiac pacemaker

          -  Severe hypertension (diastolic BP &gt; 100 on medication)

          -  Anti-coagulant therapy, or medications known to increase risk of hemorrhage,
             (e.g.:ASA, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins)

          -  History of a bleeding disorder, coagulopathy or with a history of spontaneous tumour
             hemorrhage

          -  Documented cerebral infarction within the past 12 months

          -  TIA in the last 1 month

          -  Cerebral or systemic vasculopathy

          -  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

          -  Immunosuppression (corticosteroids to prevent/treat brain edema are permitted)

          -  Contraindications to MRI such as non-MRI-compatible implanted devices

          -  Large subjects not fitting comfortably into the MRI scanner (generally &gt;250 lbs)

          -  Difficulty lying supine and still for up to 4 hours in the MRI unit or claustrophobia

          -  Untreated, uncontrolled sleep apnea

          -  Positive pregnancy test (for pre-menopausal women)

          -  Known life-threatening systemic disease
