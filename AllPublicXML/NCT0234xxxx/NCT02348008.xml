      bevacizumab. No randomization or blinding is involved.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      The phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate MK-3475 in combination with bevacizumab in
      subjects with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma after failure of at least one systemic
      therapy for metastatic disease. The phase II trial will determine the activity of the
      combination of MK-3475 and bevacizumab in first line therapy for subjects with metastatic
      clear cell renal carcinoma.

      PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 5mg on
      day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate
      intravenous infusions.

      Cohort 2 will consist of 3-9 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 10mg on
      day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate
      intravenous infusions.

      If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of
      therapy, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all three subjects in
      dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be
      enrolled to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no further escalation
      beyond dose level 2.

      PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      The maximum safe dose of MK-3475 in combination bevacizumab (as determined in the phase 1b
      cohort) will be given on day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression
      of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the
      study, have progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for a total of
      24 months.

      Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% within 28 days prior to registration for protocol
      therapy.

      Life Expectancy: 6 months or greater

      The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L

        -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9/L

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  OR, if serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40
           mL/min

      Hepatic:

        -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN

        -  OR, AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying
           malignancy

      Coagulation:

        -  INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN

        -  OR for subjects receiving warfarin or LMWH, the subjects must, in the investigator's
           opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving
           anticoagulant therapy. The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the
           goal of anticoagulant therapy.

             weeks of study registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline)
             from adverse events of such agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Phase II: has had prior therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

          -  Surgery within 4 weeks prior to study treatment except for minor procedures: NOTES:

             as determined by the treating physician.

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to
             exclude brain metastasis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to study
             registration. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is
             excluded regardless of clinical stability.

             chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however,
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are
             not allowed.

          -  History of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis unless controlled
             by anticoagulant treatment.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs).

        NOTE: Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
        replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form
        of systemic treatment.

          -  Received prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1
             or at baseline) from adverse events from previously administered agents. NOTE:
             Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and can still be
             considered for the study.

          -  Any clinically significant infection defined as any acute viral, bacterial, or fungal
             infection that requires specific treatment. NOTE: Anti-infective treatment must be
             completed ≥ 7 days prior to study registration.

          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease, history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would exclude the
             subject from receiving bevacizumab. Examples may include but are not limited to:

               -  Hemoptysis (defined as &gt; ½ teaspoon of blood)

                  registration

               -  Any drugs or supplements that interfere with blood clotting can raise the risk of
                  bleeding during treatment with bevacizumab. These drugs include vitamin E,
                  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil,
                  Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), warfarin (Coumadin), ticlopidine
                  (Ticlid), and clopidogrel (Plavix).These agents should be used with caution.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

          -  Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to study
             registration.

             the subject or interfere with protocol compliance.

          -  Any mental or medical condition that prevents the subject from giving informed consent
             or participating in the trial.

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, Gleason ≤ grade 7 prostate cancers, or
             other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least 5 years.

          -  Received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy and the subject must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of
             the regimen.
