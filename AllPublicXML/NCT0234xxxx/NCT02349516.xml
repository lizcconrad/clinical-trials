      A randomized, controlled study of the safety and efficacy of Squalamine Lactate eye drops in
      combination with Ranibizumab intravitreal injections in patients with diabetic macular edema.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms:

        1. Squalamine Lactate Ophthalmic Solution administered twice a day for 52 weeks in
           combination with monthly injections of ranibizumab from baseline through week 20 and
           ranibizumab as needed from week 24 through week 52.

        2. Vehicle Ophthalmic Solution administered twice a day for 52 weeks in combination with
           monthly injection of ranibizumab from baseline through week 20 and ranibizumab as needed
           from week 24 through week 52.

        3. Squalamine Lactate Ophthalmic Solution administered four times a day for 52 weeks in
           combination with monthly injections of ranibizumab from baseline through week 20 and
           ranibizumab as needed from week 24 through week 52.

        4. Vehicle Ophthalmic Solution administered four times a day for 52 weeks in combination
           with monthly injection of ranibizumab from baseline through week 20 and ranibizumab as
           needed from week 24 through week 52.
