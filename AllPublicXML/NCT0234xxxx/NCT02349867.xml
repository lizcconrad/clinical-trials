    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of concurrent chemoradiation using a regimen of sorafenib and
      vorinostat with gemcitabine and radiation following chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic
      cancer to find the RP2D of the concurrent chemoradiation combination. A traditional 3+3
      dose-escalation design will be conducted for the sorafenib and vorinostat dose escalation.
      Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without distant metastasis that has been treated with ≥ 1
      prior therapy (not including radiation) encompassing at least 2 months. Adequate hematologic,
      hepatic, and renal function. Ability to take oral medication. To determine the doses and
      schedule appropriate for phase 2 study of sorafenib and vorinostat with concurrent
      gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer
      following chemotherapy.

      To determine the doses and schedule appropriate for phase 2 study of sorafenib and vorinostat
      with concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic
      cancer following chemotherapy. RP2Ds and schedule of sorafenib and vorinostat defined as the
      doses and schedule that are the same as or less than the MTDs and schedule.

      This is a dose-escalation trial employing a standard &quot;3+3&quot; schema of sorafenib and
      vorinostat.

      The sample size with a total of 5 proposed dose levels and starting at dose level 1B for dose
      escalation, the number of patients evaluable for DLT ranges from 4-30. To account for about
      20% patients anticipated to subsequently be found to be not evaluable for toxicity,
      authorization for enrollment of 36 patients will be sought from regulatory authorities.
      Likely scenarios probably involve 12-24 evaluable patients and therefore 15-30 patients will
      be enrolled in the study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2-3
      months up to 2 years or until death.

    <description>Patients must receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (multiple regimens are acceptable) prior to enrollment onto this clinical trial. Chemoradiation study treatment should start within 6 weeks of completing chemotherapy. Patients receive gemcitabine IV infusion over 30 minutes (200 mg/m2 weekly) x 6, concurrent administration of oral sorafenib and oral vorinostat (both per dose-escalation schema), and concurrent RT( 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy or Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy) administered at 1.8-Gy fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy over 5 ½ weeks (28 daily fractions). Correlative studies will be performed by collecting peripheral blood samples at several time-points for circulating tumor cells (CTC) enumeration and to evaluate CD95 density. Samples will be analyzed by negative-selection techniques (RosetteSep) or with ApoStream dielectrophoretic field-flow fractionation (DEPfff) enrichment device.</description>
