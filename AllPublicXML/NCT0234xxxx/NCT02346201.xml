  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a Phase III, placebo-controlled,
      masked, 6 month, 10-center randomized clinical trial sponsored by National Institutes of
      Aging involving 200 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADMET 2 is designed to
      examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant
      apathy in AD participants. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as
      outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of
      methylphenidate on apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the
      treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia.
      Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI
      apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months.

      ADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically
      significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs,
      electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms. Safety will also be
      measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory (NPI).

      Changes from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using
      the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed.

      Cost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and
      cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)
      and other scales.
