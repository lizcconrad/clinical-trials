  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) is increasingly being reported as an effective and
      safe method of respiratory support for children with severe asthma exacerbations unresponsive
      to standard therapies and with impending respiratory failure. Much of the evidence base
      supporting its use comes from retrospective observational studies, and there is currently a
      lack of data from randomized controlled trials to inform this practice.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of BiPAP in children with moderate to severe
      asthma exacerbations could reduce the length of hospital stay, need for invasive ventilation,
      and use of intravenous bronchodilators. The investigators aim to test this hypothesis by
      randomizing children attending the Emergency Department with a moderate to severe clinical
      severity score refractory to inhaled bronchodilators to receive either BiPAP in addition to
      standard asthma care, or standard care alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children aged 2 - 18 years presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with a moderate or
      severe asthma exacerbation (Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) of &gt; 3) who fail
      to improve clinically with standard ED management with inhaled salbutamol and ipratropium
      will be randomized to receive either standard asthma management according to our local severe
      asthma guideline or management with BiPAP in addition to standard care. Both groups will
      receive a comparable dose of systemic steroid and hourly salbutamol inhalers with subsequent
      weaning according to PRAM score. Patients randomized to receive BiPAP will be admitted to the
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and those randomized to the control group will be
      admitted to the medical ward. Both groups will be monitored with 3-hourly PRAM scoring
      through the duration of their admission.
