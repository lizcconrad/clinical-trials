          -  Acceptable medical history and physical examination including:

        no particular clinically significant abnormality in X-ray and ECG results within six months
        prior to study. no particular clinical significance in general disease history within two
        months prior to study.

          -  Acceptable vital signs (within normal limits or considered by the investigator or
             physician to be of no clinical significance) at screening, which includes pulse rate,

          -  Acceptable clinical chemistry determinations (within normal limits or considered by
             the investigator or physician to be of no clinical significance) within two months
             prior to study, which includes AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase,
