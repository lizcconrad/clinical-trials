  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to compare - in a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded trial - a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol to misoprostol used
      alone for missed abortion.

      The primary aim of this trial is to compare the efficacy of mifepristone-misoprostol versus
      misoprostol alone for treatment of missed abortion. This will be a randomized controlled
      double-blinded trial of 416 women comparing misoprostol alone to mifepristone plus
      misoprostol for treatment of missed abortion less than 13 weeks+ 0 days LMP. All women in the
      trial will undergo routine screening (including ultrasound) and pre-medical induction care
      per standard practice at the hospital. All eligible women agreeing to participate in the
      study will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens: 1) STUDY GROUP ONE: 200mg
      mifepristone followed in 24 hours by 800mcg sublingual misoprostol; 2) STUDY GROUP TWO:
      placebo followed in 24 hours by 800mcg sublingual misoprostol.
