  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of renal function on the plasma,
      urine, and dialysate pharmacokinetic profile of CB-238,618 in humans. The study will also
      assess the safety profile and tolerability of CB-238,618 in subjects with varying degrees of
      renal impairment and in healthy subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single dose of CB-238,618</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose through Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single dose of CB-238,618 will be determined. The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters to be evaluated include, but are not limited to, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax), area under the curve (AUC), clearance (Cl), terminal half- life (t½), volume of distribution (Vd). These parameters will be used to determine potential differences in exposure when study drug is administered in healthy versus renally impaired subjects. The urine and dialysate pharmacokinetic parameters to be evaluated include, but are not limited to, the cumulative amount eliminated (Ae), the fraction eliminated (fe), and clearance (Cl) in humans.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with adverse events (incidence, severity, and type), changes in clinical laboratory tests (including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examination, and any concomitant (non-study) medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from the time of study drug administration (study day 1) through the last study follow up (may occur from study day 9 to study day 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by examining the incidence, severity, and type of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests (including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examination, and any concomitant (non-study) medications.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with renal impairment are to have mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment,
             or ESRD requiring HD. ESRD subjects requiring HD should have been receiving HD on a
             three times/week schedule for at least three months preceding the initial dose in this
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For healthy subjects (Group A): history or presence of any clinically significant
             illness (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic,
             musculoskeletal, or psychiatric) or any other condition, including clinically
             significant anemia, which in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the
             safety of the subject or the validity of the study results

          -  For renally impaired subjects (Groups B to E): as above, except that renal
             insufficiency and other medical conditions commonly associated with renal impairment
             (eg, hypertension, diabetes, which should be stable for at least three months
             preceding the initial dose of study medication in this study) are allowed

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination, medical history, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, or laboratory values, as judged by the
             investigator or designee. Subjects with renal impairment should have clinical
             laboratory values consistent with their disease and approved by the investigator

          -  Evidence of clinically significant hepatic impairment including alanine
             aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or
             bilirubin &gt; 1 × ULN

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL, unless considered stable and not clinically significant in the
             opinion of the investigator in subjects with ESRD and on HD;

          -  Subjects with renal impairment who are not on a chronic stable drug regimen, defined
             as starting a new drug or changing dosage within 14 days prior to administration of
             study medication, except for drugs administered in relationship to HD

          -  Subjects with fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating renal function. Assessment of the
             stability of the subject's renal function will be determined by the investigator

          -  Subject has a currently functioning renal transplant and/or has been on significant
             immunosuppressant therapy, as determined by the investigator, within the last six
             months
