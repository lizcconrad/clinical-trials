  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to analyse the role of a neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a
      putative biological marker of the cognitive recovery in schizophrenia following a Cognitive
      Remediation Therapy (CRT). Additionally, the role as outcome predictors of BDNF serum levels
      and the Val66met polymorphism and data from functional and structural neuroimaging will be
      studied.

      Forty patients with schizophrenia disorder and twenty healthy volunteers will be recruited.
      Patients will be randomly allocated either the experimental group, undergoing an individual
      CRT for 40 hours during 16 weeks, or the control group following a psycho-educational
      intervention without any neurocognitive work, both lasting the same amount of hours and
      period of time. Blood samples will be obtained from participants in four moments: before
      treatment, at week 4, at week 16, and at 32 week follow-up. In addition, repeated
      measurements will be obtained with a neurocognitive battery based on the MATRICS consensus
      battery and the Positive And Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Assessments will be conducted
      by trained personnel who will remain blind to the group assignment. A factorial model will be
      performed conducting a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to study the effects
      of CRT on the levels of BDNF, neurocognition, symptoms and social functioning, adding the
      necessary co-variants. Finally, a linear regression model to determine the predictive role of
      serum levels of BDNF and data from functional and structural neuroimaging on the effects of
      CRT will be performed.

    <description>The program has a duration of 40 sessions (one hour of duration), with two sessions for week during four months. It is carried out individually and utilizes paper and pencil tasks. The main technique utilized is the scaffolding (to provide strategies when the patient cannot carry out the task and to withdraw him when he is yet able of doing it alone) in a context of learning without errors.</description>
