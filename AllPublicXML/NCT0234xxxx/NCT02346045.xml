  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor and numerous treatment strategies have
      been developed to treat hypertension properly and reduce cardiovascular risk.

      B. However, there is a subgroup of hypertension which are resistant to treatment.

        1. Resistant hypertension is associated to sympathetic hyperactivity

        2. Renal sympathetic nerve is known to be associated with systemic sympathetic activity

        3. According to research of recent years, catheter based renal sympathetic denervation is a
           safe and effective treatment modality to treat resistant hypertension C. Resistant
           hypertension is observed in end stage renal disease (ESRD) frequently.

      D. Sympathetic hyperactivity is observed in ESRD patients E. Catheter based renal sympathetic
      denervation is expected to improve resistant hypertension in ESRD patients

      F. The aim the present study is to evaluate the effects and safety of catheter based renal
      sympathetic denervation on resistant hypertension in ESRD

    <description>In the experimental arm, Intervention is renal sympathetic denervation using SymplicityÂ® system (Medtronic Ardian Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) and antihypertensive medications previously prescribed
After femoral puncture guiding catheter is engaged in renal artery
Symplicity radiofrequency ablation catheter is inserted into renal artery and by circular sequence, from distal to proximal portion, ablation energy is applied to the wall of renal artery
4-5 ablations are applied in each renal artery.
In the sham comparator, intervention is renal angiogram and continue antihypertensive medications previuosly decribed</description>
