    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of ImmunoPulse IL-12® in
      treatment-refractory metastatic and unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (HNSCC). ImmunPulseIL12® is the combination of intrtumoral interleukin-12 gene (also known as
      tavokinogene telseplasmid [tavo]) and in vivo electroporation-mediated plasmid
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] vaccine therapy (tavo-EP) administered using the OncoSec Medical
      System (OMS). Intratumoral tavo is a gene therapy approach to directly induce a
      pro-inflammatory response within a tumor to initiate and/or enhance anti-tumor immunity.

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) by RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is defined as the percentage of participants with evaluable lesions that achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first study treatment to 30 days after the last study treatment (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could have, therefore, been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined an any untoward medical occurrence that at any dosage resulted in one or more of the following: death, A life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) by Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is defined as the percentage of participants with evaluable lesions that achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using irRC criteria. CR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and the absence of new lesions for at least 4 weeks duration, confirmed by additional scan and visit 4 to 6 weeks after first documentation of CR. PR: ≥50% decrease in the product of the diameters from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Regression Rate of Treated and Untreated Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The treated (injected, electroporated) lesion regression rate is defined as the percentage of patients who had at least one treated lesion that decreased in longest dimension by ≥ 30%. The untreated (non-injected, non-electroporated) lesion regression rate is defined as the percentage of patients who had at least one untreated lesion that decreased in longest dimension by ≥ 30%.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) time is defined as the duration between the date of treatment initiation (Study Day 1) to the first date of either disease progression at either local or any distant sites, or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Patients were censored at their date of last assessment, if they were alive and without evidence of disease progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment weeks until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to 14.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTP is defined as the number of days between the treatment initiation date (Study Day 1) and the earliest date of documented disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 or death that is not associated with prior disease progression. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

        <description>BORR is defined as the percentage of participants with evaluable lesions that achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions.</description>

          <title>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) by RECIST v1.1</title>
          <description>BORR is defined as the percentage of participants with evaluable lesions that achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could have, therefore, been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined an any untoward medical occurrence that at any dosage resulted in one or more of the following: death, A life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage.</description>
