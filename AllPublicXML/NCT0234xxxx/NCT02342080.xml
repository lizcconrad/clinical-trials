      The objective of this project is to verify the effects of suspended robotic gait training
      (Lokomat) in recovery of functional capacity of the lower limbs patients with incomplete
      spinal cord injury.

    <description>A group with spinal cord injury will be trained in a 30-minute session 5 times weekly for 6 weeks. Each session will be supervised by qualified staff. Patients will undergo training with gradual increase in load and speed, according to the tolerance of each patient. The body weight support progression will start at 50 % of the patient body weight. It will be changed every 2 weeks and the load will decrease 10%. The progression of speed may be accompanied during the training period. For the robot locomotion therapy, the Lokomat system (Hocoma AG Switzerland) will be used.</description>
