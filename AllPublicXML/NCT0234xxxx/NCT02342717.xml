    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG,
             and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10
             halflives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc
             interval

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Male subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming
             pregnant from the first dosing day until two month after the trial completion.
             Acceptable methods of contraception comprise barrier contraception and a medically
             accepted contraceptive method for the female partner (intra-uterine device with
             spermicide, hormonal contraceptive for at least two month prior trial participation)

          -  Known fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or saccharose-isomaltase
             deficiency

          -  History of relevant liver diseases such as disturbance of liver function, jaundice,
             drug induced liver injury, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or liver tumours
