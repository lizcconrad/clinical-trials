      therapy with pembrolizumab, following initial treatment with concurrent chemoradiation in
      patients with inoperable or unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC. No randomization or

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Eligible patients must have completed concurrent chemoradiation with a standard chemotherapy
      regimen (either cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/paclitaxel) and a dose of radiation
      ranging from 59.4-66.6Gy, with restaging completed 28 days to 56 days post-chemoradiation.
      Patients with progressive disease will not be eligible for investigational treatment.
      Patients with stable disease/response will be eligible to register for investigational
      treatment of consolidation therapy to begin a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 56 days
      from completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

           upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X
           institutional ULN (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of
           creatinine or CrCl)

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects
           with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 institutional ULN

           transaminase (ALT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X institutional ULN

             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Interstitial lung disease or history of pneumonitis requiring treatment with
             corticosteroids

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy

          -  History of psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Clinically active infection as judged by the treating investigator (≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE

             B or C

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator
