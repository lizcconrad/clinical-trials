      This phase I clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety of autologous Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells (MSC) injected intracavernously.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellgram-ED is autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo expanded for
      approximately 30 days. Ten patients (Diabetes -associated ED; 5 patients, Postprostatectomy;
      5patients) will be injected Cellgram-ED directly into the intracavernous. Patient will be
      evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of MSC.
