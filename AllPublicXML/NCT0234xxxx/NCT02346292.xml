      The study is an observational multicenter descriptive study. It is planned to enroll
      approximately 1250 subjects with severe and very severe COPD hospitalized for the reason of
      COPD exacerbation into departments of pulmonology or therapy. The study will be conducted in
      approximately 20-25 institutions of treatment and prevention in Russian Federation and will
      include about 50 to 60 subject at each clinical site.

      The study is an observational multicenter descriptive study. It is planned to enroll
      approximately 1000 subjects with severe and very severe COPD hospitalized for the reason of
      COPD exacerbation into departments of pulmonology or therapy. The study will be conducted in
      approximately 20-25 institutions of treatment and prevention in Russian Federation and will
      include about 50 to 60 subject at each clinical site.

      This is an observational study, so there is no treatment protocol or subjects' management
      recommendations required. The study subjects receive medical treatment according to the
      routine practice for their disease in Russian Federation. A subject's participation in this
      clinical study should not affect character and amount of care provided according to the
      routine clinical practice.

      The study includes 5 clinical visits: Study Enrolment Visit, Month 3 Visit, Month 6 visit,
      Month 9 Visit, Month 12 visit / End of Study Visit.
