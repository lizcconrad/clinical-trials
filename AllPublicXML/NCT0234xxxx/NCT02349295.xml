  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Minimal Disease Activity (MDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>It uses a composite of 7 key outcome measures (includes PASI) used in PsA to encompass all of the domains of the disease to measure the overall state of a patients' disease. The LEI is used to assess tender entheseal points. Patients are classified as achieving MDA if they fulfill 5 of 7 outcome measures: 1. TJC ≤1, 2. SJC ≤1, 3. PASI total score ≤1 or BSA ≤3, 4. patient pain VAS score of ≤15, 5. patient global VAS score of ≤20, 6. HAQ-DI score ≤0.5, 7. tender entheseal points (6 entheseal points) ≤1.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Complete Resolution in Enthesitis as Assessed by the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The LEI was developed specifically for use in PsA. It measures enthesitis at 6 sites (lateral epicondyle, left and right; medial femoral condyle, left and right; Achilles tendon insertion, left and right). Each site was assigned a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present); the results from each site were then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 6). So, &quot;0&quot; indicates good score here.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a participant reported questionnaire that measures disease-associated disability(physical function).It consists of 24 questions with 8 domains: dressing/grooming,arising,eating,walking,hygiene,reach,grip and other daily activities. The disability section scores the participant's self-perception on degree of difficulty (0=without any difficulty,1=with some difficulty,2=with much difficulty,3=unable to do)covering the 8 domains.The HAQ-DI is a composite ranging from 0-3 with lower scores indicating less functional disability.The reported use of special aids/devices and/or the need for assistance of another person to perform these activities is assessed.Least Square (LS) mean calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) analysis with treatment,baseline score,geographic region, TNFi experience,visit, treatment-by-visit interaction(itcn), geographic region-by-visit itcn,TNFi experience-by-visit itcn and baseline score-by-visit itcn.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</title>
        <description>The Itch NRS is a participant-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst itch imaginable.&quot; Overall severity of a participants itching from psoriasis was indicated by circling the number that best described the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, TNFi experience, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, geographic region-by-visit interaction, TNFi experience-by-visit interaction, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count (TJC)</title>
        <description>TJC is the number of tender and painful joints determined for each participant by examination of 68 joints. Joints were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Participants were asked for pain sensations on these manipulations and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any positive response on pressure, movement, or both was translated into a single tender-versus-nontender dichotomy.

        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in 28 joints that consists of a composite numerical score with the following variables: TJC28, SJC28, hs-CRP (measured in mg/L), and Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity recorded by participants on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) VAS. For DAS28-CRP, the Tender Joint Count 28 (TJC28) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC28) are a subset of TJC and SJC, and include 14 joints on each side of the body: 2 shoulders, 2 elbows, 2 wrists, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, the 2 interphalangeal joints of the thumb, the 8 proximal interphalangeal joints, and the 2 knees. DAS28 values range from 0 to 9.4. Higher values indicate more severe symptoms and greater functional impairment. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, TNFi experience, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, geographic region-by-visit interaction, TNFi experience-by-visit interaction, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Score</title>
        <description>The BASDAI is a self-administered measure used to answer 6 questions with a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) VAS pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of axial activity. To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI Score. BASDAI ranges from 0-10. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, TNFi experience, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, geographic region-by-visit interaction, TNFi experience-by-visit interaction, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Score</title>
          <description>The BASDAI is a self-administered measure used to answer 6 questions with a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) VAS pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of axial activity. To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI Score. BASDAI ranges from 0-10. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, TNFi experience, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, geographic region-by-visit interaction, TNFi experience-by-visit interaction, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had baseline axial involvement defined as baseline BASDAI score &gt;4, baseline BASDAI score and post baseline BASDAI score data.</population>
