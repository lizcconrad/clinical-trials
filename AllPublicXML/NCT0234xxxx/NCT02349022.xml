      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M PET/CT
      with that of [111In]-capromab pendetide as an immuno PET tracer in the detection of prostate
      cancer pre-prostatectomy as confirmed by pathology.

      Individuals participating in this study will have a [111In]-capromab pendetide scan, as well
      as a PET scan following the injection of [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a &quot;Minibody&quot;) chelated
      with Desferroxamine and radiolabeled with 89Zr. [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M targets the extracellular
      domain of Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen (PSMA) expressed on most primary and metastatic
      prostate cancer lesions.

      [111In]-capromab pendetide (Prostascint®) is an FDA approved imaging agent targeting the
      intracellular domain of PSMA. It is anticipated that [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M will outperform
      Prostascint® because of this targeting difference.
