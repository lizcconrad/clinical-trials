      An open label study in 9 male and 9 female healthy subjects to determine the pharmacokinetics
      of parent compound and metabolite after eight days of dosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 9 male and 9 female healthy subjects. Following informed consent and
      satisfactory screening, each will be dosed for seven consecutive days on an outpatient basis
      with OC000459 50 mg daily taken before breakfast. On the seventh day, subjects will report to
      the clinical unit. Following an overnight fast, blood samples will be drawn for baseline
      safety and pharmacokinetic measurements and a urine specimen will be obtained for urinalysis
      and baseline metabolite measurements and subjects will be dosed with 50 mg OC000459. Blood
      samples will then be drawn at selected intervals for 120 hours post dosing and will be
      analysed for OC000459 parent compound and its metabolite. Urine collections will be obtained
      over the same period to determine the excretion of the metabolite and parent compound in
      urine.
