      The purpose of this study is to compare the added effects of TENS and Supervised Motor
      Control Exercises (SMCE) over Unsupervised Home Exercise Program (UHEP) on disability, pain
      and other outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common problem causing disability and high economic burden
      in globally as well as in Nepal. There is no consensus on treatment of CLBP, however motor
      control exercises have good evidence on improvement in pain and disability in CLBP
      population, whereas transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a common treatment
      of choice with some evidence. But, we do not know if supervising these motor control
      exercises (SMCE) and TENS have any added benefit over home exercise program (HEP) which is
      commonly prescribed mode of exercises. We plan to conduct a three armed randomized control
      trial to answer this question to compare effects of SMCE, TENS and HEP versus SMCE and HEP
      versus HEP alone on disability and pain at two weeks and six months follow up. Three
      way-mixed model analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used as the statistical test.
      Appropriate post hoc analysis will be done to compare within group and between group
      differences.

Equipment- TENS (CEFAR Basic TENS Machine)
Electrodes- Four channel electrode to cover the site of pain
Site of electrode placement- will be decided by the physical therapist to best suit or cover the area of pain based on complaints of patient based on the body chart.
Intensity- the intensity will be increased progressively until maximum tolerable intensity is reached. This stimulation may cause visible muscle contraction. This type of current is also referred to as Motor-level TENS, which is effective for chronic pain. The intensity will not be increased beyond 25 milli Amperes if no sensation is perceived by the patient.
Frequency- 5 Hertz
Duration- 30 minutes</description>

    <description>Six sessions of supervised Motor control exercises will be provided over the period of two weeks. Exercises will be provided in order to target the function of core muscles of the spine. Each participant in the SMCE group will be trained by a physical therapist to recruit the deep muscles of the spine and reduce the activity of superficial muscles.
Initially participants will be taught how to contract the transversus abdominis and multiﬁdus muscles in isolation from the more superﬁcial trunk muscles, but in conjunction with the pelvic ﬂoor muscles. Pressure biofeedback will be used in order to provide feedback about muscle recruitment to the participant. Exercises will be provided to the participants in the progressive manner. Later, movement of limbs will be incorporated with the contraction of the core muscles. Finally, these core muscle activation will be emphasized during the functional activities.</description>
