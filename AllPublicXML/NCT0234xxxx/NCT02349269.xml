      The aim of the investigators trial was to evaluate association between new onset
      postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and late cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      The material of this retrospective study consist patients without preoperative history of
      atrial fibrillation, participated in three different randomized controlled trials previously
      . A total of 519 consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, aortic valve
      replacement or combined aortic valve with coronary bypass surgery in Kuopio University
      Hospital from 2004 to 2008. Patients with previous episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) or
      flutter and also patients with mitral valve surgery were excluded. All patients had
      continuous postoperative ECG monitoring for at least 48 hours. AF episodes lasting longer
      than 5 minutes were registered. Thereafter 12 lead ECG was recorded daily and in case of
      symptoms of rhythm disturbances.

      Medical records were reviewed during 2012 using standardized data collection protocol.
      Statistics Finland database was used for mortality data.
