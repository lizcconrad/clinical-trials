  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fraud and waste is estimated to cost the American health care system nearly $200 billion each
      year, and the public Medicare and Medicaid programs about $60 billion each year. This study
      will evaluate a new method for fighting fraud: mailing informative letters to outlier
      providers to notify them of their aberrant behavior. These letters are targeted at high
      prescribers of schedule II controlled substances in Medicare Part D. The investigators will
      look at the effects of these letters on the behavior of providers and their patients. These
      effects are of substantial policy interest as they suggest how to best design anti-fraud
      policies. They are also of academic interest, shedding light on the behavior of physicians
      and their patients.

    <description>The prescribing of schedule II controlled substances over the 3 months following the initial sending of the letters. Prescribing is defined as the total &quot;days supply&quot; of schedule II controlled substances attributed to the prescriber, expressed in &quot;30-day equivalents&quot; i.e. divided by 30.</description>
