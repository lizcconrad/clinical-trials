  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a blend of berries and probiotics in
      reducing low-grade inflammation and intestinal permeability in the elderly. The intervention
      period is one month. Blood and fecal samples will be collected for analysis at baseline and
      at the end of the intervention with the aim to analyse possible changes in different
      parameters at the two timepoints. The participants will also be asked to keep a study diary
      throughout the study period for the documentation of their intestinal health and as a means
      for checking compliance.
