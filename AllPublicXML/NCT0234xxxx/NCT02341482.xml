    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. Collected at Day 3 for PF-04958242 0.025 mg Arm and Day 17 for PF-04958242 0.025 mg + itraconazole 200 mg Arm.</description>

Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling.

          <title>Number of Participants With Positive Response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
          <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment [C-CASA]) is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced the following: completed suicide (1), suicide attempt (2) (response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (3)(“Yes” on “preparatory acts or behavior”), suicidal ideation (4) (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), any suicidal behavior or ideation, self-injurious behavior (7)(“Yes” on “Has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior”).</description>
