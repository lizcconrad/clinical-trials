      Purpose of the Study Critical illness requiring life support affects over 150 000 people in
      Ontario every year. With aggressive support, the number of people who die from critical
      illness is decreasing. However, people who survive often have neurological problems. These
      neurological problems often include difficulties with memory, concentration, and attention.
      These problems are associated with poor quality of life among survivors of critical illness.
      The aim of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to these neurological
      deficits. Specifically, the investigators are testing whether changes in oxygen delivery to
      the brain during critical illness are related to both short- and long-term neurological
      complications.

      Procedures involved in the Research When patients are diagnosed with a critical illness such
      as shock or respiratory failure, they are treated with intravenous fluids, medications to
      raise their blood pressure, and can be placed on a ventilator to assist with their breathing.
      They are observed in an intensive care unit (ICU). This research protocol does NOT interfere
      with the normal treatment of patients with critical illness. The procedure involved in this
      research protocol requires the placement of two stickers to either side of the patient's
      forehead, and information about oxygen delivery to the brain will be recorded. When the
      patient has recovered from the critical illness, they will be asked to perform several
      neurological tests. Some of these tests will be done with a pencil and paper, while others
      will use a robotic device to test arm movements, reaction time, and concentration.

      Potential Harms, Risks or Discomforts:

      This research study involves the placement of a sticker sensor to either side of the
      forehead. Rarely, patients may develop a rash to these electrodes. The investigators monitor
      patients very carefully for rashes, and if a rash is to occur, the sticker sensor will be
      removed. With regards to the neurological testing, rarely patients can have some mild muscle
      stiffness after moving their arms in the robot. The investigators do not expect any other
      further harms, risks, or discomforts.

    <measure>Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Proportion of ICU stay spent delirious. The average ICU stay is 7 days at our institution, however, some patients may stay much longer. We will perform delirium screening to a maximum of 30 days after ICU admission.</time_frame>
    <description>The CAM-ICU and ICDSC are used to screen for delirium in critically ill patients. On the basis of these two validated screening tools, patients will be categorized as either comatose, delirious, or intact. The percentage of ICU stay that the participant spends delirious is the primary outcome measure.</description>
