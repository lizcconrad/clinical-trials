  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a disabling chronic disease and the most frequent discharge diagnosis
      for hospitalization among older adults.The American Heart Association (AHA) 2006 update on
      heart disease reported that 5 million Americans are believed to have symptomatic HF, and
      550,000 patients are newly diagnosed each year. The estimated direct and indirect cost of HF
      in the United States (U.S.) for 2006 was ~$29.6 billion. Despite the significant resources
      expended on the treatment of this disease, outcomes remain poor. The five-year survival for
      individuals diagnosed with HF is less than 50%, and in end-stage HF, the one-year survival
      may be as low as 25% regardless of medical therapy.

      Recent studies suggest that the failing heart is not refractory to treatment, as was
      previously believed. For example, the observation that a small percentage of subjects with
      left ventricular assist devices can be permanently weaned from their device strongly suggests
      that damaged hearts are capable of recovering lost function.

      Celladon Corporation (Celladon) is investigating gene transfer as a method to restore calcium
      ion (Ca++) cycling in HF patients. The gene therapy vehicle uses a recombinant
      adeno-associated viral vector (AAV), which consists of an AAV serotype 1 capsid and contains
      the human sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ ATPAse (SERCA2a) complementary DNA (cDNA) flanked by
      inverted terminal repeats derived from AAV serotype 2 (AAV1/SERCA2a). MYDICAR® refers to
      AAV1/SERCA2a drug product intended for administration by percutaneous delivery. Phase 1/2
      clinical trials have demonstrated initial safety and evidence of improvement in clinical
      outcomes at MYDICAR doses of up to 1 x 10^13 DNase-resistant particles (DRP). The trial
      described here is designed to investigate the safety profile and preliminary activity of
      MYDICAR at a dose of 2.5 x 10^13 DRP; this dose is 2.5-fold higher than previously
      investigated doses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unless otherwise specified, screening must be performed within 30 days prior to
             enrollment (phase 1) or enrollment/randomization (phase 2) except as noted below.
             Subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

               1. AAV1 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) negative (titer &lt;1:2 or equivocal) within 60
                  days prior to screening.

               2. Age 18-80 years, inclusive, at the time of signing the first informed consent.

               3. Chronic ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, except for hypertrophic
                  cardiomyopathy. Toxic or alcoholic cardiomyopathies are allowed as long as toxin
                  or alcohol exposure has been eliminated and a sufficient amount of time has
                  elapsed to rule out spontaneous recovery. Similarly, patients with viral or
                  peripartum cardiomyopathy will not be enrolled until sufficient time has elapsed
                  to rule out spontaneous recovery. Subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy must have
                  at least 1 major coronary vessel with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
                  (TIMI) grade 3 flow. (If a subject has not undergone recent coronary angiography,
                  TIMI flow may be assessed during the study angiography just prior to
                  investigational medicinal product [IMP] infusion).

               4. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%.

               5. Diagnosis of New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure (HF) for a
                  minimum of 60 days prior to screening.

               6. For phase 2 only, the presence of at least one of the following risk factors:

                    1. Hospitalization for HF within 6 months of screening, or in lieu of
                       hospitalization, at least 2 outpatient interventions for the intended
                       treatment of signs and symptoms of worsening HF (e.g., intravenous [IV]
                       diuretics, peripheral ultrafiltration).

                    2. N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) &gt;1200 pg/mL
                       within 30 days of screening; if subject is in atrial fibrillation, NT-proBNP
                       &gt;1600 pg/mL within 30 days of screening.

               7. Individualized, maximal, optimized HF therapy consistent with American College of
                  Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines for the treatment of
                  chronic heart failure (ACC/AHA HF guidelines) and as updated from time to time:

                    1. Medical therapy, as appropriate to the individual subject, including oral
                       diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or, if ACE
                       intolerant, angiotensin-receptor blocker and beta blocker at approved
                       dosages as labeled in the respective package insert and optimized for the
                       subject.

                         -  The choice of beta blocker is limited to those approved for HF
                            (bisoprolol, carvedilol or metoprolol succinate). Metoprolol tartrate
                            is not approved for HF and is not allowed.

                         -  Unless contraindicated or not tolerated, the addition of an aldosterone
                            antagonist should be considered in the absence of hyperkalemia and
                            significant renal dysfunction and according to evolving standards.
                            However, the final decision is at the discretion of the investigator.

                         -  Dosing of the above medications must be stable for a minimum of 30 days
                            prior to screening, although up- or down-titration of diuretics, as
                            medically indicated, is permitted.

                         -  Patients requiring IV diuretics during this period will be required to
                            undergo an additional 30 day period of stabilization on oral diuretics.

                         -  Enrollment of any subject with any deviation from these criteria must
                            be preapproved by the medical monitor.

                    2. Resynchronization therapy, if clinically indicated according to ACC/AHA HF
                       guidelines, must have been initiated at least 6 months prior to screening.

                    3. If the subject is already participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program,
                       it should be consistent with the current clinical practice and guidelines
                       and continue at least through the 12-Month Active Observation Period. This
                       does not imply that the potential candidate must be enrolled in a cardiac
                       rehabilitation program at screening or in the future.

               8. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator is required and must have been implanted a
                  minimum of 30 days prior to screening.

               9. All male subjects regardless of fertility status or the fertility status of their
                  partner must agree to use a condom and spermicide during any sexual relations for
                  6 months following IMP administration to protect their partner from potential
                  viral shedding.

              10. All subjects regardless of fertility status or the fertility status of their
                  partner must agree to have any male partner use a condom and spermicide during
                  any sexual relations for 6 months following IMP administration to protect their
                  partner from potential viral shedding.

              11. All subjects capable of procreation with their partners must agree to use
                  adequate contraception for 6 months following IMP administration to avoid
                  pregnancy (defined as oral or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
                  surgical sterilization in addition to/or a combination of a condom and
                  spermicide).

              12. Agree to not donate sperm or oocytes for 6 months following IMP administration.

              13. Ability to sign Informed Consent Form and Release of Medical Information Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

               8. Likely need for an immediate heart transplant or MCSD implant due to hemodynamic
                  instability.

               9. Prior coronary artery bypass graft(s) is not necessarily exclusionary. A
                  potential candidate should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the treating
                  interventionist, taking into account the dominance of the system, the
                  accessibility of the graft(s) orifice, and the contribution of the graft
                  vessel(s) and native coronary arteries to viable myocardial perfusion. The case
                  and tentative infusion strategy must be discussed with the medical or safety

                  current glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤20 mL/minute/1.73 m^2 estimated by
                  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for calculating the GFR MDRD
                  calculation.

                  subject has been disease free for at least 5 years since the time of diagnosis
                  and treatment).

              17. Previous participation in a study of gene transfer; however, if the study was
                  unblinded or documentation otherwise exists that the subject was randomized to
                  the placebo control group and did not receive active gene transfer agent, the
                  subject may be considered for this study.

              18. Receiving investigational intervention or participating in another clinical study
                  within 30 days or within 5 half-lives of the drug prior to screening. Exception
                  may be made if the individual is enrolled in a non-therapeutic observational
                  study (registry) or the observational portion of a therapeutic study where the
                  sponsoring authority authorizes enrollment.
