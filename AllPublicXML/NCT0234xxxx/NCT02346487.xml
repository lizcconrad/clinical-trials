  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out to provide supportive clinical data on the feasibility,
      efficacy, safety, and PK of LPV based therapies in routine treatment setting and will be
      based on the existing LPV/r pellets which already represent a clear advantage in comparison
      with the liquid formulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of LPV/r pellets in addition to
      AZT/3TC (or ABC/3TC) paediatric fixed dose combination (FDCs) tablet under routine treatment
      conditions in HIV infected infants and young children who cannot swallow tablets.

      As secondary objectives:

        -  Document the safety of LPV/r pellets and AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC

        -  Assess the population pharmacokinetics of LPV/r and NRTIs when administered as LPV/r
           pellets plus AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC

        -  Measure adherence to the new formulation

        -  Evaluate children acceptability of the LPV/r pellets and associated dual NRTIs as well
           as ease of use by the care giver.

        positive assays from two different samples taken at a different date as preferred option.

          -  At any age: HIV-1 DNA PCR positivity

          -  At any time &gt;4 weeks of age: HIV-1 p24 antigen detection or HIV-1 RNA viral load &gt;
             5,000 copies/mL plasma

          -  At any age &gt;18 months: HIV-1 antibody reactive on two different manufacturers'
             licensed rapid tests based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test
             principal, or repeatedly reactive on a licensed enzyme immune assay (EIA)and confirmed
             on a second sample by any one of the following assays: rapid test (a third
             manufacturer), licensed EIA, Western blot, chemi-luminescence assay, or plasma RNA
             with a viral load &gt; 5,000 copies/mL

        One single positive PCR assay result will be acceptable for inclusion of a child less than
        18 months in the study Although the 2nd PCR assay would not be performed at the time of
        treatment initiation/treatment switch,

          -  In case the test is RNA PCR viral load), the sample should be taken before treatment
             initiation and analyzed as soon as possible thereafter,

          -  In case the child is already on treatment, the test should be DNA PCR based, the blood
             sample can be taken while on treatment and the results be made available as soon as
             possible.

          -  ARV treatment eligible children with LPV-based treatment indication* as defined by
             country-specific guidelines or the WHO pediatric treatment guidelines confirmed by

               1. ARV naïve, or

               2. Already on first line liquid lopinavir based treatment, or

               3. Failing first line NNRTI based therapy

          -  Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide written informed consent. *Age is
             not an inclusion criterion. Children older than 5 years who need a LPV/r based
             treatment and cannot swallow tablets are eligible. Analysis will be stratified
             according to study entry point (naïve, first line, failure)

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Planned or concurrent use of NNRTIs, integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, or PIs
             other than LPV/r.

          -  PIs treatment failure with the presence or strong suspicion of a PI resistance
             mutation.

          -  Clinical condition requiring the use of a prohibited medication in association with
             LPV/r
