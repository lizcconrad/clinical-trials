  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to investigate which components of the quadriceps femoris muscle are affected
      following an ACB with different volumes (10, 20 and 30 ml) of 1% lignocaine evaluated by
      electromyography. Both a placebo treatment (20ml saline) and the femoral nerve block (20ml
      lignocaine 1%) as an active comparative will be used for model control. Further, we want to
      investigate the effect of volume on motor block. This will be evaluated by measuring the
      Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) of the quadriceps femoris muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ACB has a well-proven analgesic effect after TKA, but we do not know which nerves that
      are affected by the block. Aside being a motor nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis of the
      quadriceps femoris muscle, contains the second largest sensory contribution from the femoral
      nerve. It is probable that some of the analgesic effect of the ACB arises from blocking this
      nerve.

      Even though the ACB is mainly a sensory nerve block, a study in healthy volunteers showed a
      small decline by 8% in quadriceps muscle strength(10). It is speculated that the decline in
      muscle strength was caused by the spread of local anesthetic to the nerve supplying the
      vastus medialis of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Three out of eleven of the volunteers
      experienced an even larger decline of 25 % in quadriceps muscle strength. It has been argued
      that this decline likely was caused by a proximal spread of the local anesthetic to the
      femoral triangle thereby resulting in an affection of the femoral nerve. In this study, a
      volume of 30 ml of local anesthetic was used.

      We do not know the optimal volume for the ACB and we find it relevant to investigate to what
      extent and which parts of the quadriceps muscle gets affected when different volumes of a
      local anesthetic are injected into the adductor canal. Selective affection of the different
      components of the femoral quadriceps muscle can be assessed by non-invasive EMG recordings.
      Further, the quadriceps femoris muscle strength will be evaluated by measuring the MVIC
      following the different volumes. The EMG recordings will be voluntary (vEMG) measured during
      MVIC and stimulated (sEMG). sEMG is measured during transcutaneous electrical stimulation of
      the femoral nerve.

    <description>For each subject a series of 5 voluntary EMG recordings during MVIC will be made to estab-lish the variability of the EMG recordings. This will be done prior to the blocks on each day resulting in 300 EMG recordings from the vastus medialis and 300 recordings from the vastus lateralis. From this variability we will establish a cut-off point (how large a decline in EMG amplitude is &quot;synonymous&quot; with affection of the nerve?). After the cut-off point has been established the EMG data will be presented in dichotomous form: affected/not affected</description>
