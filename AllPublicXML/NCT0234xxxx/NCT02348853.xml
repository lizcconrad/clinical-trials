      U.S. Army Medical Research &amp; Materiel Command Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research
      Center (TATRC) is sponsoring the HF2 (Healthy Families, Healthy Forces) Study. This is a
      randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss.
      Specifically, the investigators will compare a &quot;current best practice(CBP)&quot; intervention that
      includes standard dietary advice with a new, &quot;Healthy Weight for Living (HWL)&quot; intervention
      that includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber, low glycemic
      index carbohydrates and low calorie foods. The objective of this study is to compare the CBP
      and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of active duty (AD) military
      personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and the AD military
      personnel they live with.

      This is a randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss.
      Specifically researchers will compare a current best practice (CBP) intervention that
      includes standard dietary advice with a new Healthy Weight for Living (HWL) intervention that
      includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber and low glycemic index
      carbohydrates. The population will be adult dependents of Active Duty (AD) military personnel
      or retired military personnel (direct intervention participants) and the AD or retired
      military personnel they live with (indirect intervention participants). The primary outcome
      will be weight change from baseline to 2 years in the adult dependents. The objective of this
      study is to compare the CBP and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of AD or
      retired military personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and
      the AD or retired military personnel they live with. The working hypothesis is that that the
      HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 2 years than the CBP
      intervention in an intent-to-treat analysis in adult dependents and their AD or retired
      military personnel, and that the greater weight loss in HWL will be associated with improved
      management of hunger and greater adherence to the goal of reducing energy intake.

      The researchers plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the study objectives with
      the following technical objectives:

        1. Conduct a randomized trial comparing the HWL intervention to the CBP intervention over 2
           years in adult dependents of AD or retired military personnel. The primary outcome will
           be weight change from baseline to 2 years. The working hypothesis is that randomization
           to the HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 2 years
           than randomization to the CBP intervention, and that greater weight loss in the HWL
           intervention will be associated with greater adherence to the goals of reducing energy
           intake and hunger.

        2. Examine the effects of the interventions delivered to adult dependents of AD or retired
           military personnel on the weight of AD or retired military personnel themselves. The
           working hypothesis, based on preliminary data, is that there will be a &quot;ripple&quot; effect
           of program benefits from intervention participants to the AD or retired military
           personnel they live with; specifically, overweight and obese AD or retired military
           personnel will lose more weight if their partner is randomized to the HWL intervention
           compared to the CBP intervention, because the weight loss of AD or retired military
           personnel indirectly exposed to the intervention will be proportional to the weight loss
           of their adult dependent who is directly exposed.

        3. Compare the effects of the two interventions on changes in cardiometabolic risk factors.
           The working hypothesis is that there will be significantly greater improvements between
           baseline and 2 years in key cardiometabolic risk factors in adult dependents enrolled in
           the HWL intervention compared to the CBP intervention, and differences between groups
           will be predicted by differences in weight loss.

    <description>HWL is a behavioral intervention designed to effectively facilitate hunger suppression with several concurrent approaches. Hunger suppression is a core behavioral goal of the intervention, and strategies will be used to support that goal, for example increasing meal frequency and encouraging the use of highly satiating low-energy foods to reduce hunger acutely. A unique combination of healthy dietary goals will be recommended that support hunger suppression and/or maintenance of satiety: high total dietary fiber, moderately high protein, moderately low glycemic load (GL) and low energy density.</description>

    <description>This intervention is an adapted version of Group Lifestyle Balance which is a validated weight loss program for community groups and military populations that is an official adaptation of the gold standard Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Balance intensive research intervention. It has both training programs for interventionists and program material available on the web and is also slightly modified from the Diabetes Prevention Program study to take into account changing national nutrition recommendations.</description>
