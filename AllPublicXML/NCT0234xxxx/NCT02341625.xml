  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamics of BMS-986148 administered alone and
      in combination with nivolumab in patients with mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer,
      ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer.
