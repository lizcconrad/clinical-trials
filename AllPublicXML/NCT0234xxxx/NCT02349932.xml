  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A person's blood type is defined by the types of sugars they express on their red blood
      cells, with antibodies being made to non-self sugars and excluding blood cells expressing
      these sugars (the basis of blood transfusion reactions). These same sugars can be expressed
      by commensal bacteria in our gut lumens. The investigators hypothesize that a person's
      antibodies to non-self sugars also attach to and exclude non-self sugar-expressing bacteria
      in our guts. Supporting our hypothesis, a person's blood type correlates with the overall
      composition of their gut flora. Because these sugars are also used by certain pathogens to
      initiate infection, this information could directly inform our understanding of host
      susceptibility to various infectious organisms.

      A member of the study staff will collect a small volume of blood sample through a finger
      prick and 2-3 milliliters of saliva from you. Using these samples, we will determine your
      blood type (defined by your expression of specific sugars on your red blood cells) and your
      expression pattern of these sugars in body secretions (e.g., saliva). You will provide us
      with a fecal sample collected the day of your appointment. The fecal sample should be
      collected in a pre-provided collection container and should be collected within 12 hours of
      drop-off. Using your fecal sample, we will determine the types of bacteria present in your
      normal gut flora and whether they express the same sugars expressed on your blood cells.
      Tests will be done only for research purposes and will not be evaluated or used to diagnose
      or treat any of your medical problems. Sample collection may need to be repeated if required
      for your medical care in the future.

      Blood, saliva, and fecal material will be collected from subjects. The blood and saliva will
      be used for typing sugar expression. DNA will be extracted from stool samples and used for
      characterization of the gut flora.
