  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study proposes to utilize a novel, wearable device, QI Device, which has multiple
      sensors embedded in a &quot;wrist-watch&quot; in order to explore its monitoring capabilities in
      individuals with congestive heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The QI Device is a self-contained, reusable, rechargeable, battery-powered, wrist-watch that
      simultaneously tracks and records a number of physiological health related parameters such as
      heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and motion/position. One advantage
      of this device over current home diagnostic systems is the capability for longitudinal
      monitoring.
