  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study protocol is to develop and test a culturally sensitive,
      community-based intervention, ESENCIAL Para Vivir (Essential for Life) to promote weight loss
      and diabetes prevention among overweight or obese Latina immigrants. We chose to focus on
      Latinas because Latinas are at especially high risk for developing diabetes and currently
      there are not Spanish programs available in our area that provide education about weight
      management and diabetes prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 8-week weight loss program, ESENCIAL Para Vivir (Essential for Life), is comprised of 6
      groups sessions and 2 individual sessions delivered by a bilingiual, bi-cultural Community
      Health Advisor. All sessions are interactive with activities that build on educative content
      and most contain an interactive DVD component. We propose an innovative approach that will
      employ the DVD in tandem with our education sessions delivered by a Community Health Advisor
      to maximize buy-in from participants as well as provide access to community health leaders
      (medical professionals - endocrinologists, internists, nutritionists). Participants will be
      over 19 years of age, self-identifying as Hispanic women without diabetes, not pregnant or
      have given birth within the previous six months. The participants will be recruited from
      Jefferson County through community agencies and organization. Participants will be recruited
      and screened with an initial contact sheet to ensure that they meet our criteria, then they
      will be consented and complete baseline measurements. At the completion of the program,
      participants will repeat measures done at baseline, and 6 months post program completion.
