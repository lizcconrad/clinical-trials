  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A very common complication following distal pancreatectomy is leakage from the pancreas, or
      what is called a pancreatic fistula. We hypothesize that operative drains which create
      suction may contribute to the development of leakage from the pancreas. This study evaluates
      the effect of using non-suctioning drains to prevent the development of this complication.

      The most common complication following distal pancreatectomy is the developement of leakage
      from the remaining pancreas gland, which results in significant morbidity. Most surgeons
      leave dains at the time of surgery to prevent complications from pancreatic leakage. However,
      we hypothesize that drains which create continous negative pressure may contribute to the
      development of a pancreatic fistula. This study randomizes patients to suctioning versus
      non-suctioning drains. The primary endpoint is the development of pancreatic fistuale, as
      defined by the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery.
