    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a national multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial
      involving more than 70,000 children and adolescents aged 7-18 years from 7 provinces in
      China. In each center, about 12-16 primary and secondary schools, with totally at least 10000
      participants were randomly selected (Primary: Secondary=1:1). All of the selected schools
      were randomly allocated to either intervention or control group (Intervention:
      Control=1:1).The multi-components school-based and family-involved scheme was conducted
      within the intervention group for 9 month, while students in the control group followed their
      usual health practice. The intervention consisted of four components: a) Create supportive
      school and family environment, b) Health lifestyles education and related compulsory physical
      activities, c) Instruct and promote school physical education, d) Self-monitor obesity
      related behaviors. Four types of outcomes including anthropometric, behavioral, blood
      chemical and physical fitness were measured to assess the effectiveness of the intervention
      program.
