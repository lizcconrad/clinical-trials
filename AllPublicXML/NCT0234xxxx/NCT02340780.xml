  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, buparlisib, has on chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buparlisib has been shown to shrink tumours in animals. It has been studied in some people
      and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard
      treatment.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is chemotherapy, targeted therapy or
      radiation, either alone or in combination.
