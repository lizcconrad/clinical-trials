  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will determine whether Tai Chi is an effective and practical intervention
      to improve overall function and lower health care utilization in an expensive, vulnerable
      population of seniors that is more representative of many US communities than those
      previously studied. If the results are favorable, our study will also provide the necessary
      training and protocol manuals to replicate Tai Chi programs in senior housing facilities
      across the nation to help prevent, better manage, and overcome frailty among seniors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people living in low-income housing facilities represent one of our nation's largest,
      most functionally impaired, economically disadvantaged, and understudied populations that
      account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending. This revised competitive renewal
      application aims to improve the health and reduce the health care utilization of this
      population by conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi exercises vs.
      health education and social calls in 16 housing facilities in cities surrounding Boston. The
      proposal builds upon previously successful studies by Drs. Lipsitz, Wayne, and others showing
      multiple benefits of Tai Chi exercises in elderly people with a variety of diseases and
      disabilities. A randomized, controlled pilot study supported by the current R37 grant that
      this application seeks to renew, showed that 12 weeks of Tai Chi exercises tailored to the
      abilities of frail seniors living in supportive housing facilities can improve balance, gait,
      and physical function. The proposed study aims are to determine the effects of Tai Chi
      exercises conducted at least twice weekly over a 6-month period on 1) functional performance
      measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery and 2) health care utilization determined
      from self-reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations in poor, multiethnic, elderly
      residents of low income housing facilities. Secondary outcomes will include person-centered
      measures such as physical function, cognition, psychological well-being, falls, and
      self-efficacy. We hypothesize that compared to the control intervention, Tai Chi will
      significantly improve physical function and reduce health care utilization. This study will
      prepare the necessary training and protocol manuals for widespread dissemination of Tai Chi
      programs in housing facilities across the nation. It will also provide estimates of potential
      Medicare cost savings that can be used to justify future health insurance payments for this
      intervention. The previous experience of the Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues
      at Harvard Medical School and Brandeis University in aging research, clinical trials,
      functional assessment, Medicare claims analyses, and Tai Chi interventions will help assure
      the project's success.

    <description>This arm will receive a 6-month Tai Chi training intervention. Tai Chi training will include gentle dynamic stretching and strengthening, slow integrated movements, efficient posture, heightened body awareness and inner focus, active relaxation of body and mind, mindful diaphragmatic breathing, and healing imagery and intention. Participants will be asked to complete two formal group classes each week for at least 6 months, led by senior Tai Chi instructors. Additionally, participants will be given practice DVDs (and DVD players if necessary) and instructions for daily home practice a minimum of 20 minutes on 3 non-class days each week.</description>
