  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is heterogeneity in patients with depression. Many scholars propose that
      individualization of antidepressant achieves better outcomes. However, the scientific
      theoretical basis of individualized treatment is still quite weak. Different clinical
      subtypes of depression and their possible biomarkers are critically needed to provide the
      individualization with theoretical base. Diagnostic types of major depression disorder (MDD)
      based on the Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and possible differentiations in
      neurobiochemistry, metabonomics and neuroimaging could be one of ways to explore the
      biomarkers and support the theory of the individualized treatment.

      The hypothesized results will be of help to clarify the biological basis of MDD with LDQS and
      with DBHS, to provide the TCM with further scientific evidence, to explore the pathogenesis
      of depression, to improve the objective diagnosis of depression, and to promote targeted
      interventions by Western medicine, TCM or both.

      The objectives of this study is to explore if there are any differences in neurobiochemistry,
      metabonomics and neuroimaging (1) at the baseline, between the subjects who are the normal
      controls (C Group) and who both meet diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of 5th edition (DSM-V) on MDD and TCM criteria of 'pattern of Liver Depression and Qi
      Stagnation (LDQS)' or'pattern of Deficiency of Both Heart and Spleen (DBHS)' (T Group); (2)
      at the baseline, between the MDD subjects of LDQS and DBHS; (3) after 6-week venlafaxine
      administration, between the MDD subjects of LDQS and DBHS. 50 subjects in T Group and 25 in C
      Group are recruited in the study and the main laboratory tests include High Performance
      Liquid Chromatography(HPLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrum(GCMS) and neuroimaging DTI
      technology.
