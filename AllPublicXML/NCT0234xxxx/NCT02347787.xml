  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of community
      health worker (CHW) vs. usual clinician support in helping chronically-ill patients with low
      socioeconomic status to improve their health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community Health Workers (CHWs) have the potential to improve chronic disease outcomes among
      patients with low socioeconomic status (SES). Yet, widespread use of CHWs has been hampered
      by lack of standardized, scalable and evidence-based models. Our community-academic-health
      system team used participatory action research with low-SES patients to design IMPaCT
      (Individualized Management for Patient-Centered Targets). A randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      of 446 hospitalized patients with varied diseases demonstrated that a 2-week dose of IMPaCT
      improved access to care, mental health, activation, and quality of communication, while
      reducing recurrent hospital readmissions. We have adapted IMPaCT for use among low-SES
      primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions.

      This RCT is designed to evaluate the newly adapted IMPaCT model in 3 primary care settings -
      academic, federally qualified health center, and VA. Upon enrollment in the trial, patients
      will collaboratively set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider.
      Patients will then be randomized to collaborative goal-setting versus goal-setting augmented
      by 6 months of support from an IMPaCT CHW. Follow-up will be conducted at 6- and 9- months
      post-enrollment.

      The study design is a single-blinded, 2- armed, multi-site randomized controlled trial
      involving three clinic sites and 444 patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 PCS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The main dependent variable is mean change in standardized score for self-rated physical health. We assess this outcome using the SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score. The PCS is a measure of perceived physical health that predicts several objective outcomes including future hospitalizations and mortality. It is relevant across age, disease, and treatment group. We will measure the between-arm Page 12 of 27 difference in mean change in SF-12 PCS between baseline and 6-month follow-up assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic disease control</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will asses this outcome using biometric testing (HgA1c, manual blood pressure, weight, and anabasine tobacco assay). We will measure both change in these clinical parameters (continuous) and achievement of each patient's chronic disease management goal (dichotomous: yes/no). At six months after enrollment, all patients will undergo a clinic visit and the appropriate laboratory testing depending on their chronic conditions: HgbA1c, manual blood pressure, weight, and self-report of tobacco use and anabasine assay which indicates tobacco cessation.
Patients' measurements on these parameters will be used to determine their change in standardized score for their outcome of interest. All outcome measures will be ascertained by a team of blinded outcomes assessors (the Research Coordinator and Research Assistants) at 6 months after study enrollment. We will use EMR data +/- 4 weeks of baseline or 6-month f/u to replace missing data if we are unable to obtain study labs or measurements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived mental health</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess this outcome using the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. The MCS reliably detects differences in mental health over time. We will measure the between-arm difference in mean change in SF-12 MCS score between baseline, 6- and 9- month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of patient-centered care</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess this outcome using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Patient- Centered Medical Home (CAHPS PCMH) survey. This survey assesses quality of patient-centered primary care and can be used by any practice (not just PCMH practices). We will measure the CAHPS PCMH domains pertaining to Self-Management Support and Comprehensiveness of Care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital admission</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure admission to hospital at 30 days, 6- and 9 months after enrollment.
This data will be obtained through 1) self-report, 2) the Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council (PHC4), a state-based initiative that tracks utilization data across the state of Pennsylvania, 3) the Veterans Affairs electronic medical record, 4) the Penn electronic medical record</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessment of intervention and mechanisms affecting achievement of primary outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At 6-months post-enrollment, a trained qualitative interviewer on our study team will conduct an in-depth qualitative semi-structured interview with 40 intervention arm patients and their CHWs. Qualitative interviews will be audio-taped and transcribed. Patients will be purposively sampled across each study site in order to be able to make comparisons between those who achieved a minimally important improvement in the primary outcome and those who did not. These interviews will be guided by the Integrative Behavior Model (IBM).</description>

    <description>The IMPaCT intervention has three stages:
Goal-setting: CHWs will help patients to deconstruct the chronic disease management goal they set with their PCP into patient-driven short-term goals and action plans.
Tailored Support: CHWs will conduct weekly follow-up for 6 months through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of patients' short-term goals.
Connection with longitudinal support: IMPaCT CHWs will also facilitate a weekly patient support group.</description>
