    <textblock>
      The investigators are asking subjects to take part in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce
      Readmissions among Black Men with Heart Disease (NAVI-HF) research study. This research study
      will test how well trained laypeople working as patient navigators will help patients
      recently hospitalized for heart failure avoid future hospitalizations. NAVI-HF is a new
      program sponsored by funding from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health
      Disparities. People who enter into the study will work with a patient navigator to undergo
      the full program or work with a trained layperson to receive general education on heart
      disease treatment and prevention. The purpose of the study is to determine whether a patient
      navigation program will be effective in reducing the number of hospitalizations in the future
      for program participants. This study will enroll 416 participants from UAB.

      Therefore, in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce Readmissions among Black Men with Heart
      Disease (NAVI-HF) study, the investigators propose to recruit 416 AA men with Heart Disease
      receiving inpatient care at UAB Hospital and randomize them either to Heart Disease self-care
      education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan (Education + PN arm) or to Heart
      Disease self-care education alone (Educational Control arm). The investigators will compare
      participant outcomes such as all-cause and Heart Disease readmission rates, Heart Disease
      self-care adherence as well as cost effectiveness across the two intervention arms. Our
      Specific Aims are:

        1. To assess the 30-day all-cause readmission rates among male African American Heart
           Disease patients receiving Heart Disease self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care education alone

        2. To assess the Heart Disease self-efficacy and heart failure self-care adherence among
           male African American Heart Disease patients receiving Heart Disease self-care education
           plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care
           education alone

        3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Heart Disease self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus Heart Disease self-care education alone
