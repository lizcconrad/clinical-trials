      The overall objective of the study is to compare and assess the clinical outcomes of the
      standard of care hybrid ablation using epicardial ablation in conjunction with endocardial
      PVI alone versus epicardial ablation in conjunction with endocardial ablation using PVI with
      additional RF ablation in a randomized, prospective population of patients with persistent AF
      of at least 6 months duration. All devices that are used are being utilized under the
      approved labeling of the devices.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the leading causes of stroke and heart failure. It is also
      a major cause of hospitalizations and mortality (Stewart, Wattigney, and Wolf). Patients with
      atrial fibrillation (AF) who are intolerant to Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs often
      require endocardial ablation, which can include pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation or cryoballoon ablation (Medtronic, MN) and reported
      success rates vary (Calkins et al). In patients with persistent and long standing persistent
      AF success rates may not be as high (Akoum et al) and there is little data analyzing outcomes
      for patients in this population (Calkins et al). Using an epicardial-endocardial, or hybrid,
      approach Gehi et al describes a 66% 12 month arrythmia-free survival rate following the
      procedure, with 37% patients still on antiarrythmic drug therapy at 12 months. Furthermore, a
      paper by Anderson et al reports that the hybrid ablation results in lower costs and higher
      quality adjusted life years for patients with non-paroxysmal AF as reported by the studie's
      results of fewer repeat ablations and maintenance of sinus rhythm at 5 years. Conflicting
      reports exist on how much endocardial catheter ablation is needed for patients in persistent
      and long standing persistent AF. Verma et al reports results for patients in persistent AF
      having endocardial PVI compared to P VI plus additional linear lesions. Eighteen month
      success rates for these patients were 59% and 46% respectively.

      Success of surgical hybrid ablation using epicardial ablation cocontaminent with endocardial
      PVI alone versus the hybrid approach using epicardial ablation with endocardial ablation
      consisting of PVI ablation and RF ablation has not been studied using a randomized,
      prospective approach.

      If it is found that the PVI alone is as effective as PVI plus additional catheter ablation
      for patients receiving a hybrid ablation, it may reduce the need for extensive catheter
      ablation, thereby reducing the radiation exposure, procedure time, and radiofrequency
      ablation time.

    <description>The primary endpoint is success or failure in patients with persistent AF of at least 6 months duration to be AF/Atrial tachycardia (AT)/Atrial flutter (AFL) free and free of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) except for a previously failed or intolerant AAD in the same class following the 3 month blanking period through the 12 months post procedure follow-up visit. A failed AAD is defined as recurrence on that particular AAD.
Crossover: After the three month blanking period, if the patient is in persistent AF, the patient may undergo DCCV and antiarrhythmic medication started. The follow up will start after this date.</description>
