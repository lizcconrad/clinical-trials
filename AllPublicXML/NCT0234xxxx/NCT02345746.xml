      In this study, Hepatic Arterial Infusion will be combined with systemic therapy for patients
      with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one line of systemic
      chemotherapy.

      In this phase II study, investigators will combine the HAI with systemic therapy for patients
      with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one line of systemic
      chemotherapy. We hypothesize that combination therapy will be able to convert some patients
      to surgical resection candidates, or/and to overcome chemo-resistance of liver metastases to
      systemic i.v. chemotherapy for some clinically fit, heavily pre-treated patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Performance status ECOG 0-2 and a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.

          2. Patients were required to have measurable disease in the liver, defined as lesions
             measuring &gt;1 cm in largest diameter on spiral-computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI)

          3. Histologically confirmed metastatic advanced solid tumors involving the liver, liver
             replacement less than 70%

          4. No bevacizumab (avastin) use within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Absence of portal vein thrombosis

          6. Not a surgical candidate or patients refuse surgery

          7. Loss of response to at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy including FU,
             Oxaliplatin or irinotecan in metastatic setting

          8. An asymptomatic extra-hepatic disease is allowed, provided that the extent of the
             metastatic disease in the liver represented the bulk of the metastatic disease.

          9. History of liver-directed therapy is eligible at the investigator's discretion.

         10. Adequate renal function with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min.

         11. Hepatic function as follows: Total Bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL, AST ≤5 times upper normal
             reference value, or ALT ≤ 5 times upper normal reference value.

         12. Adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥1500 cells/uL; PLT ≥ 100,000 cells/uL) before each
             therapy.

         13. At least three weeks from previous immunotherapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy before
             being enrolled in this study.

         14. All females in childbearing age MUST have a negative serum HCG test unless patients
             have prior hysterectomy. Women of childbearing potential must take adequate
             precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment.

         15. Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical or radiographic evidence of moderate amount of ascites.

          2. History of cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B or C.

          3. Pregnant or lactating females.

          4. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to protocol treatment plan
             and follow-up requirements.

          5. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          6. Patients with bleeding diathesis (clinical bleeding, prothrombin time =/&gt; 1.5 X upper
             institutional normal value, INR =/&gt; 1.5, activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT
             =/&gt; 1.5 X upper institutional normal value), active gastric or duodenal ulcer.

          7. History of thrombophilia, recurrent DVTs, diagnosis of phospholipid syndrome.

          8. Past or current history of malignancy other than colon cancer with the exception of
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other cancers
             cured by local therapy alone and a DFS ≥5 years.

          9. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements.

         10. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease: myocardial infarction or
             unstable angina within 6 months, New York Heart Association Grade II or greater
             congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, unstable
             angina pectoris, clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

         11. Patients have untreated brain metastasis or leptomeningeal metastases requiring
             immediate intervention.
