  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, blinded, randomized, controlled study designed to examine
      phytochemical absorption, metabolism and excretion, as well as vascular health and satiety,
      after ingestion of 4 different bean varieties (pinto, navy, red kidney, black). Eligible
      participants will attend 6 in-person clinic visits for comparative testing of the 4 bean
      varieties versus lentils and rice.

      This is a single site, blinded, randomized, controlled study designed to examine
      phytochemical absorption, metabolism and excretion, as well as vascular health and satiety,
      after ingestion of 4 different bean varieties (pinto, navy, red kidney, black).

      Recruitment will consist of a total of 8 volunteers. Volunteers will be recruited through
      advertisement from the local community.

      The study will be conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute,located at the St.
      Boniface Hospital. Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to
      participation in the study. Participants who have provided written consent will be asked to
      attend an in-patient visit to provide a fasting blood sample. Should the participant be
      eligible to participate, they will be scheduled for six study visits to assess the
      bioavailability, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in beans compared to
      lentils and white rice.

      Uptake, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in different varieties of beans
      during acute phase testing in healthy individuals will be examined. Possible relationships
      between phytochemical composition of the beans, arterial function and satiety will be
      investigated as the secondary objective.

    <description>At one of the six visits, participants will consume a ¾ cup of cooked navy beans. Participants will be provided with 100 ml of water with the food, and will be allowed to drink water whenever necessary during the 6 hour test period. The participants will not be blinded to the order and the type of food product they receive at a visit, however, the samples will be assigned a number to ensure the analytical team is blinded to the test product until the end of the study. Should the need to re-administer a test product arise, the participant will receive the test product from the same treatment number again at an extra visit after the original 6 visits have been completed.</description>
