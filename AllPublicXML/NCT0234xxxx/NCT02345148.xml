    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      intranasally administered esketamine in elderly participants (greater than equal to [&gt;=] 75
      years of age) and younger healthy adult participants (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 2-cohort, single-dose, open-label study. The duration of study will
      be approximately 42 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is,
      28 days before study commences on Day 1) and open-label Treatment (Day 1) and Follow-up (up
      to Day 13). Esketamine will be administered by intranasal route (delivery of medications
      through the nasal mucosa) on Day 1. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
