    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the effects of aspirin and zileuton on genes related
      to tobacco use in current smokers. Aspirin and zileuton may interfere with genes related to
      tobacco use and may be useful in preventing lung cancer in current smokers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze the impact of combined treatment of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (aspirin) and
      zileuton on smoking-related gene expression signature in the nasal epithelium in current
      smokers and to analyze any difference between the ASA and zileuton intervention and placebo
      control.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of ASA and zileuton on three lung cancer gene signatures (an 80-gene
      bronchial signature, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K] pathway gene signature and a
      nasal diagnostic gene signature) and to compare this to placebo control.

      II. To determine whether the change in the smoking-related gene expression signature and the
      three lung cancer gene signatures of nasal epithelium persists 10-14 days off agent
      intervention.

      III. To measure urinary prostaglandin E metabolite (PGE-M) and leukotriene E(4) (LTE[4])
      levels in current smokers after ASA and zileuton.

      IV. To assess the safety in current smokers of 12 week exposure to ASA and zileuton.

      V. To evaluate a gender effect in the modulatory effects of ASA and zileuton on smoking
      related-gene expression signature.

      VI. To explore the effect of ASA and zileuton on the metabolomics profile of the arachidonic
      acid pathway.

      VII. To explore, in a discovery-driven fashion, the effect of ASA and zileuton on
      whole-genome gene expression.

      VIII. To analyze the impact of ASA and zileuton on karyometric analysis of buccal cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and zileuton PO twice daily (BID)
      for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive aspirin placebo PO QD and zileuton placebo PO BID for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.

    <description>A two-sided two-sample t test will be used to test whether or not there are significant differences in changes in smoking gene signature score (changes from baseline) between the treatment and placebo groups. Exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate whether the effect of ASA and zileuton on smoking-related gene expression signature is modulated by gender and whether gene expression changes are associated with ASA and zileuton exposure and changes in PGE-M and LTE(4) levels.</description>
