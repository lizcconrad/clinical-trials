    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of stem revision rate in
      subjects implanted with the REDAPT™ System with a revision rate of less than 9.8% at the 5
      year mark assuming an observed rate of 6.5% at 5 years. Additional data will be collected as
      outcomes of safety and effectiveness data up to 10 years post REDAPT revision surgery.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, consecutive series study of subjects treated with
      REDAPT™. The safety and effectiveness of the REDAPT™ revision stem will be assessed over a
      maximum of 5 years with additional follow up to 10 years to assess outcomes. The objective of
      this study is to establish if the REDAPT™ stem revision rate is less than 9.8% at 5 years
      with an observed rate from literature review of 6.5% at 5 year.
