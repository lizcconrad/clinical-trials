  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial designed to translate and deliver programs via social media for a
      healthy body weight to university students. Specifically, in this trial, we will randomly
      assign 450 overweight/obese (BMI between 25-45kg/m2) university students (ages 18-35)
      enrolled at two colleges (George Washington University and University of
      Massachusetts-Boston) to one of two social media weight loss treatments (personalized or
      generic) or a contact control. The social media treatments consist of Facebook groups to
      provide social support, connectedness and intervention content, as well as daily text
      messages. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months post baseline, with
      the primary outcome being weight loss at 18 months. We hypothesize that: a) Tailored Social
      Media will lose significantly more weight at the above time points compared with Targeted
      Social Media. b) Both the Tailored Social Media and Targeted Social Media groups will have
      greater weight loss at the 6, 12, 18 month follow-ups than Contact Control. The secondary aim
      is to evaluate changes in metabolic risk factors among those participants who have maintained
      at least 5% weight loss at 18 months. We hypothesize that participants who achieve a 5%
      weight loss at 6 and 18 months will have significantly lower triglycerides, higher HDL
      cholesterol, and lower blood pressure than those who do not achieve and maintain that weight
      target. Finally, we will conduct additional formative work to evaluate the implementation
      feasibility of this intervention on college campuses, including an assessment of costs as
      well as the sustainability infrastructure using the PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation
      and Sustainability Model) model as a guide. The results of this study have the potential to
      significantly impact the delivery of obesity treatment services on college campuses.

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to this treatment arm will receive weight loss materials via text messages, Facebook postings, on-line videos, and weekly reports. The topics relate to relate to behavioral and lifestyle changes associated with weight-loss (e.g., nutrition, exercise, social support, and self-monitoring). Calorie and physical activity targets also are set. Participants will receive a suggestion to track diet, physical activity, and weight.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to this treatment arm receive all of the same weight loss materials (as well as weight, calorie, and physical activity targets) as the Targeted group above. Weekly reports will be more personalized to help participants track diet, physical activity, and weight. Additionally, participants will be asked to report on their weight, exercise and calorie goals, and receive feedback.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to this treatment arm receive health information via text messages, Facebook postings, on-line videos, and weekly reports. Topics relate to having a healthy body weight through a healthy mind, body, and energy. Some topics include stress management, importance of sleep, and importance of accepting one's body. Participants will receive a suggestion to track stress, body image, and energy levels.</description>

    <description>Each of the three intervention groups offers information that has been shown to be important for college students to have a healthy body weight. All three groups provide information on topics that we know are related to having a healthy body weight, like managing stress, keeping track of how you spend your time, and increasing self-awareness of certain health behaviors. Two of the three programs are focused on weight loss for a healthy body. The third group focuses on having a healthy mind, body and having energy during college.</description>

          1. Untreated hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or type 2 diabetes, unless permission is
             provided by their health care provider. During screening visits, blood pressure will
             be assessed. Individuals with blood pressure levels &gt;140/90 mmHg, will be informed of
             these levels and recommend that they contact their HCP. Study participation cannot
             commence or resume without HCP consent Note: Since weight control is an appropriate
             initial treatment for these medical issues, individuals can participate in the trial
             if they receive permission from their HCP, and the HCP indicates that he/she will be
             managing these risk factors. Participants who do not currently have a HCP will be
             connected with Student Health Services on each campus.

          2. Heart disease, heart problems, or participants who report being prescribed drugs for
