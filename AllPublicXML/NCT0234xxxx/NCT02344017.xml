  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-man study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ODM-204 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile of ODM-204 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-204 to recommend the dosing
      regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM-204 will be
      evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels.
