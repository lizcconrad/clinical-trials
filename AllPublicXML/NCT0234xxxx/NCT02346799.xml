      The purpose of this study is to determine whether healthy habits can be formed more
      effectively when people are rewarded for repeated engagement in a given healthy behavior at a
      specific, routinized time each day rather than at any time.

    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to examine the effect of incentives for routine exercise on the
      development of persistent exercise habits. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to
      determine whether healthy habits can be formed more effectively when people are rewarded for
      repeated engagement in a given healthy behavior at a specific, routinized time each day
      rather than at any time. Through a partnership with a Fortune-500 company, the investigators
      plan to run a large-scale, randomized field controlled trial with approximately 3,000-4,000
      participants aimed at increasing exercise rates (as measured by gym visits). During an
      incentivized four week intervention period, the investigators will encourage participants to
      select a two-hour window during the day when they feel they are most willing and able to
      exercise. Depending on condition, participants will [a] receive no further instruction or
      incentives (control condition), [b] receive a $3 or $7 bonus for each day they exercise
      during the incentive period (flexible incentive condition), or [c] receive a $3 or $7 bonus
      for each day they exercise if and only if they exercise within their specified &quot;workout
      window&quot; (routine incentive condition). Additionally, participants in a fourth condition, the
      social routine incentive condition, will face the same incentives as those in the routine
      incentive condition, but will be required to coordinate the workout window they select with a
      partner in their office. The investigators predict that the less flexible incentives will
      lead to greater habit formation than flexible incentives, producing larger and longer-lasting
      increases in exercise post-intervention. The investigators further predict that coordinating
      with a workout partner will produce even stronger habit formation. The investigators will
      collect and analyze data from participants' worksite gyms, which track gym entries and exits,
      as well as pedometer data when available.

      Our experiment will recruit employees at a Fortune-500 company who wish to exercise more.
      Recruitment will be done through an email and poster campaign. The registration stage will
      take approximately four weeks. All employees at all offices with on-site gyms will be
      eligible to enroll and upon enrollment will be asked to select a partner who works in the
      same office and who is also enrolling. Enrolling employees will also be asked to indicate
      their preferred daily workout time (a two hour &quot;workout window&quot;) and to provide basic
      demographic and exercise-related information (e.g., gender, age, height, weight, number of
      gym visits per week). If registration exceeds the target sample size (4,000 employees),
      priority for enrollment will be given to employees who do not already exercise regularly (at
      least twice a week). The remaining participants will be assigned to a &quot;holdout control&quot;
      condition. Once registration is closed, participants will be assigned randomly (at the pairs
      level) to one of the four experimental conditions.

    <description>Participants in the control group will not receive any additional treatment, apart from receiving daily emails 15 minutes before the start of their self-reported workout window. This is to control for reminder effects that may be present in the other treatment conditions. Participants in this condition will also receive a lump payment upon completion of an exit survey at the end of the intervention to equalize overall compensation.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the flexible incentive condition will be paid $3 or $7 for each workout they complete during the treatment period (with a limit of one incentivized workout per day, and twelve incentivized workouts during the four-week treatment period). These participants will receive daily emails 15 minutes before the start of their self-reported workout window, but they can work out anytime of the day and still receive their incentive payment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to the routine incentive condition will receive the same treatment as those in the flexible incentive condition except that, in order to receive their incentive payment, they must begin their workout within their two-hour workout window. For instance, if an employee chooses a 2pm to 4pm workout window, she will receive a reminder to exercise at 1:45 pm and must swipe into the gym between 2pm and 4pm in order to receive the $3 or $7 incentive payment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will have an identical experience to those in the routine incentive except that both partners who sign up for the study will be required to coordinate and select a common workout window. Thus, both partners will receive their daily reminders at the same time (and will be incentivized for working out at the same time). The incentive payment, however, will not be linked to whether or not a participant's partner completes a workout - only to the participant's own exercise decision.</description>
