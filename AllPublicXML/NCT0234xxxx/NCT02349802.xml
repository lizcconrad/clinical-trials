      Phase I study to determine the device-related injection failure rate of the single-use,
      pre-filled autoinjector.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I multi-cohort study will employ a flexible study design to accommodate multiple
      cohorts. Healthy male or female subjects &gt;or= 18 years with no significant health issues will
      be included. Each cohort will employ an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose design. Injection
      failure rates will be continually assessed. Injection pain will also be assessed.

               3. If of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have had a
                  menstrual period within 1 year), must practice and be willing to continue to

                  failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly,
                  such as implants, injectables, hormonal contraceptives, some intrauterine
                  contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, tubal ligation or occlusion, or a

               1. History of, or currently have, acute or chronic pancreatitis, or have
                  triglyceride concentrations

                    -  500 mg/dL at Visit 1 (Screening)

               2. Presence of medullary carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN II) OR a
                  family history of medullary carcinoma or MEN II

                  infarction, clinically significant arrhythmia, unstable angina, coronary artery
                  bypass surgery, or angioplasty; or are expected to require coronary artery bypass
                  surgery or angioplasty during the course of the study. Subjects with stable
                  cardiac disease are not excluded.

             investigational drug, whichever is greater) prior to Visit 1 (Screening)

          -  Has donated blood or had a significant blood loss within 2 months of first dose of
             study drug or is planning to donate blood during the study
