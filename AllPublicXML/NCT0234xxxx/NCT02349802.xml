  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I multi-cohort study will employ a flexible study design to accommodate multiple
      cohorts. Healthy male or female subjects &gt;or= 18 years with no significant health issues will
      be included. Each cohort will employ an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose design. Injection
      failure rates will be continually assessed. Injection pain will also be assessed.

                  failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly,
                  such as implants, injectables, hormonal contraceptives, some intrauterine
                  contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, tubal ligation or occlusion, or a

               1. History of, or currently have, acute or chronic pancreatitis, or have
                  triglyceride concentrations

                    -  500 mg/dL at Visit 1 (Screening)

               2. Presence of medullary carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN II) OR a
                  family history of medullary carcinoma or MEN II

                  infarction, clinically significant arrhythmia, unstable angina, coronary artery
                  bypass surgery, or angioplasty; or are expected to require coronary artery bypass
                  surgery or angioplasty during the course of the study. Subjects with stable
                  cardiac disease are not excluded.
