    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Voluma and see what effects it has on HIV
      facial lipoatrophy. The hypothesis is that Voluma will be safe, efficacious and positively
      impact the quality-of-life in the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in patients with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV facial lipoatrophy (volume loss) is an increasing concern with patients on Highly Active
      Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) because it affects the quality-of-life and adherence to
      medication regimen. Treatment of HIV facial lipoatrophy helps to improve patient wellness by
      removing the social stigma associated with HIV facial lipoatrophy. Currently, there are few
      medical therapies that can treat HIV facial lipoatrophy and are FDA-approved for this
      indication. Juvéderm Voluma (Allergan) may benefit patients on HAART because it may provide a
      more immediate aesthetic enhancement and potentially has fewer adverse effects, which results
      in a more natural appearing facial enhancement outcome. Voluma is the only agent that is
      FDA-approved for facial volume loss. We anticipate Voluma having less adverse effects than
      current FDA-approved drugs for HIV lipoatrophy as Voluma is a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based
      agent. The benefit of using hyaluronidase to &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;modify&quot; facial HA-based volume
      therapy is also a benefit for HIV patients, which currently does not exist as a
      post-injection modification option for other FDA-approved filling agents used to treat
      patients with HIV facial lipoatrophy. Voluma is currently FDA-approved for correction of
      age-related volume loss in the midface, and there's no alteration in the chemical or
      biophysical properties of Voluma that is being used in our proposed study. In addition to
      conventional injection techniques, we will implement the 'smile and fill' technique pioneered
      by our clinical research group to achieve better mid-face aesthetic outcomes.

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of Voluma injections as a treatment for HIV-associated lipoatrophy over 12 months by assessing changes in the Carruthers Lipoatrophy Severity Scale (CLSS) based on pre/post intervention photography by principal investigator (PI). CLSS is a 4-point grading scale (1 to 4, with a greater number indicating higher severity of HIV FLA). Grade 1: mild and localized facial lipoatrophy. Grade 2: deeper and longer atrophy, with the facial muscles beginning to show through. Grade 3: atrophic area is even deeper and wider, with the muscles clearly showing. Grade 4: lipoatrophy covers a wide area, extending up toward the eye sockets, and the facial skin lies directly on the muscles.</description>

The DLQI is a validated 10-item questionnaire encompassing six different domains of QOL, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Each question has four possible responses: &quot;not at all/not relevant,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; &quot;a lot,&quot; and &quot;very much&quot; that corresponds to scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and a higher score suggests a higher level of QOL impairment. DLQI total score may range between 0 to 30.</description>

CLSS is a 4-point grading scale (1 to 4, with a greater number indicating higher severity of HIV FLA). Grade 1: mild and localized facial lipoatrophy. Grade 2: deeper and longer atrophy, with the facial muscles beginning to show through. Grade 3: atrophic area is even deeper and wider, with the muscles clearly showing. Grade 4: lipoatrophy covers a wide area, extending up toward the eye sockets, and the facial skin lies directly on the muscles.</description>

The DLQI is a validated 10-item questionnaire encompassing six different domains of QOL, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Each question has four possible responses: “not at all/not relevant,” “a little,” “a lot,” and “very much” that corresponds to scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and a higher score suggests a higher level of QOL impairment. DLQI total score may range between 0 to 30.</description>
