      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      treatment (teduglutide) in Japanese patients with PN-dependent SBS. This study will also look
      at how teduglutide moves through the body (pharmacokinetics).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, 16 years of age or older at the time of signing the Informed Consent
             Form (ICF)

          -  Subjects with SBS as a result of major intestinal resection (eg, due to injury,
             volvulus, vascular disease, cancer, Crohn's disease) that resulted in at least 12
             continuous months of PN/I.V. dependency prior to signature of ICF.

          -  For subjects with a hisotry of Crohn's disease, the subject should be in clinical
             remission for at least 12 weeks prior to dosing as demonstrated by clinical
             assessment.

          -  PN/I.V. requirement of at least 3 times per week during the week before screening and
             during the 2 weeks prior to baseline to meet caloric, fluid, or electrolyte needs.

          -  Stable PN/I.V. requirements for at least 4 consecutive weeks immediately prior to the
             start of teduglutide treatment.

          -  Subjects who complete 24 weeks of dosing and still meeting the above criteria will
             continue into Stage 3 and Stage 4 of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a clinical study using an experimental drug within 30 days or an
             experimental antibody treatment within 3 months prior to signing informed consent, or
             concurrent participation in any clinical study using an experimental drug that would
             affect the safety of teduglutide.

          -  Previous use of native GLP-2 or human growth hormone within 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Previous use of intravenous glutamine, octreotide, GLP-1 analog, or dipeptidyl
             peptidase-IV inhibitors within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Previous us of teduglutide.

          -  Serial transverse enteroplasty or any other bowel lengthening procedure performed
             within the past three months.

          -  Subjects with active Crohn's disease or subjects who require biological therapy.

          -  Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease who require chronic systemic
             immunosuppressant therapy that was introduced or changed during the last 3 months.

          -  Unstable absorption due to cystic fibrosis, untreated Hirschsprung's disease or known
             DNA abnormalities (ie, Familial Adenomatons Polyposis, Fanconi syndrome).

          -  Radiographic or manometric evidence of pseudo-obstruction or severe known dysmotility
             syndrome.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant obstruction on upper GI series with small bowel
             follow-through done within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Major GI surgical intervention within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Unstable cardiac disease, congenital heart disease or cyanotic disease, with the
             exception of subjects who had undergone ventricular or atrial septal defect repair.

          -  Currently diagnosed with cancer or a history of any cancer except basal cell carcinoma
             within 5 years.

          -  Active clinically significant pancreatic or biliary disease.

          -  More than 4 SBS-related or PN-related hospital admissions within 12 months prior to
             screening visit.

          -  Hospital admission, other than scheduled, within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Signs of severe hepatic impairment at time of stabilization.

          -  Signs of disbturbed renal function at time of stabilization.

          -  Clinical signs of abnormal pancreatic condition, with abnormal laboratory results at
             time time stabilization.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Female subjects who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal or who are not using
