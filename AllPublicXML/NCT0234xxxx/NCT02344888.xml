  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of
      prednisolone during use of clomiphene citrate (CC) for induction of ovulation in infertile
      lean women having CC resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will be randomly divided into two groups; CC-Prednisolone group and CC group. Women in
      the CC-Prednisolone group will receive CC (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of
      cycle) and prednisolone (5 mg/day for 10 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle). Women in the
      CC group will receive CC alone (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle).
      Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed regularly for monitoring of follicular
      growth (folliculometry); starting from day 10 of the stimulation cycle and repeated every 2-3
      days. When there will be at least one follicle ≥ 18 mm in diameter, final oocyte maturation
      will be induced by intramuscular administration of 10000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin
      (HCG) and timed intercourse will be advised. If there will be no follicle ≥ 12 mm by day 16
      of the cycle, monitoring of follicular growth will be discontinued and the cycle will be
      presumed to be anovulatory. Ovulation will be documented by TVS scan one week after
      triggering of oocyte maturation and will be confirmed by assessing the midluteal serum
      progesterone level. Each woman will be subjected to ovarian stimulation for a maximum of 3
      consecutive cycles except if she gets pregnant in the first or second cycle
