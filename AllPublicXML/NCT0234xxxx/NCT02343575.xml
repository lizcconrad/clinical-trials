  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is the most often encountered psychiatric diagnosis in the general hospital, with
      incidence up to 85% in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and with significant
      consequences on patients' morbidity and mortality. Currently, although not FDA approved,
      antipsychotics are often considered the first-line pharmacological treatment. However, there
      can be limitations to their use, including side effects or lack of efficacy. Valproic acid
      (VPA) is one of the alternatives at times used in such patients which from limited case
      series data appears to be helpful and tolerated. VPA can provide relief from agitation that
      poses a threat to the safety and recovery of the patient. Moreover, mechanistically it
      addresses the neurochemical and cellular abnormalities inherent in delirium (it has
      NMDA-antagonist, anti-dopaminergic, GABAergic,anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and histone
      deacetylase inhibitor properties, among others). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and tolerability of the VPA in the first known to us randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of scheduled VPA as
      compared to placebo with as needed basis (PRN) haloperidol (as a back-up in both arms) for
      treatment of hyperactive or mixed delirium. Patients will be randomized to scheduled VPA or
      placebo (normal saline) and both arms will have flexible PRN dosing of haloperidol. Thus, the
      investigators plan to learn the time to delirium resolution in patients treated with VPA
      versus placebo; percentage of patients responding to VPA versus placebo; tolerability of VPA
      versus placebo. If addition of scheduled VPA proves to shorten time to delirium resolution as
      compared to placebo, lead to less use of haloperidol, and/or have fewer side effects, it
      would provide a very important addition to our limited evidence-based repertoire of delirium
      treatment. Moreover, this pilot study would then pave the way for the bigger randomized
      control trial powered to detect its effect size.
