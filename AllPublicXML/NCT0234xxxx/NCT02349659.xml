      24-SMI-2014 is a Randomised Controlled Trial with an optional one way cross-over comparing
      Conservative Medical Management (CMM) to treatment with the Axium neurostimulator + CMM.
      Subject population is chronic inguinal pain refractory to previous surgical intervention
      (neurectomy).

          2. Subject is able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule and protocol

          3. Chronic inguinal pain following Pfannenstiel Incision or Open Inguinal Hernia Repair
             for at least 6 months

          4. Previously undergone neurectomy procedure as a treatment for chronic inguinal pain

          5. Minimum daily average baseline pain rating of 5 out of 10 in the inguinal area on an
             11-point NPRS

          6. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

          7. Meets of the inclusion criteria for the implantation of a neurostimulation system as
             set out by the Dutch Neuromodulation Society

          8. Subject has been screened by a multi-disciplinary panel including the designated
             psychologist of the Máxima Medical Center and deemed suitable for implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant/nursing or plans to become
             pregnant during the course of the Trial

          2. Escalating or changing pain condition within the past month as evidenced by
             investigator examination

          3. Subject has had injection therapy or radiofrequency treatment of a target neural
             structure within the past 3 months

          4. Subject currently has an active implantable device including implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator, pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump

          5. Subject is unable to operate the device

          7. Subject has participated in another clinical investigation within 30 days

          8. Subject has a coagulation disorder or uses anticoagulants that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, precludes participation

          9. Subject has a current or on going condition, which will probably require MRI
             investigation sometime in the following 2 years
