  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate is stored in the body as glycogen, which is mainly found in the liver and
      muscle. During endurance exercise, muscle glycogen is used as fuel for the working muscles
      and liver glycogen is broken down to provide glucose to maintain blood glucose (sugar)
      levels. Both liver and muscle glycogen are important for our ability to perform
      intense/prolonged endurance exercise. Therefore, it is important to replete these stores
      after an intense/prolonged endurance exercise session in order to recover and perform
      optimally during a subsequent exercise bout, especially if the next exercise session is
      within 24h (e.g. stage races such as the Tour de France, tournament-style competitions such
      as the Olympic games and ultra-endurance events).

      Carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the availability of glycogen in the muscle and
      liver after exercise. The carbohydrates typically found in sports drinks are glucose and
      sometimes fructose. It has been observed that the ingestion of glucose will lead to a maximum
      rate of absorption of approximately ~1 g/min. However, if we also provide a different source
      of carbohydrate (fructose) then this is absorbed through a different pathway and therefore we
      can absorb up to ~1.75 g/min of carbohydrate. In addition, both carbohydrate sources are
      metabolised differently in the human body. By supplementing both glucose and fructose, we can
      potentially replenish the liver and muscle glycogen stores at a faster rate than ingestion of
      glucose only.

      Sucrose is a naturally occurring sugar that is made up of a single glucose and single
      fructose molecule. Therefore, theoretically, this can use the two different pathways of
      absorption and also maximise carbohydrate delivery. It is not yet known however, what impact
      this has on our liver and muscle glycogen stores post-exercise when supplemented in
      relatively high amounts. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess whether relative high
      amounts of sucrose ingestion will improve liver and muscle glycogen repletion after endurance
      exercise.
