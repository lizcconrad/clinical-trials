  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, are implicated in 10-15% of ovarian cancer cases, increased to 22%
      germline BRCA1/2 mutation frequency in patients with high grade serous histology subtype,
      including those women who have no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. With the rapid
      advancement of therapeutics targeted this population, this protocol seeks to provide genetic
      BRCA1/2 screening to all patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer. This information may
      help in selection of future treatment options and genetic testing for BRCA1/2 may be used to
      potentially prevent a proportion of cancer for the family members.

      This study will be an opportunity for patient to improve access at genetic and molecular
      testing for BRCA1/2 mutation which could impact her future treatment option. Moreover, this
      study will allow to prospectively assess the proportion of patients with BRCA mutation in
      ovarian cancer and describe the type of mutations identified in a large population.

      Primary Objectives

      · To provide genomic profiling for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational status in patients' with high
      grade serous ovarian cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To track the number of women with high grade serous ovarian cancer who are being
           screened in Princess Margaret Cancer Center for mutations in BRCA1/2

        -  To track accrual rates and clinical outcomes in patients with high grade serous ovarian
           cancer who are BRCA1/2-positive

        -  To correlate impact of BRCA1/2 mutational status on clinical outcome

        -  To track utilization of genetic counseling services at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre
