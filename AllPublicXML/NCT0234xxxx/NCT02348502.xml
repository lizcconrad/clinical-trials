  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBsAg loss/seroconversion is considered to be
      the ideal endpoint of antiviral therapy in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, and
      the ultimate treatment goal in CHB, However HBsAg loss occurred rarely by interferon
      treatment. Although It was reported that in nature history HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml can bring
      good long term outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B. it was not clear whether
      patients who achieved HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml by interferon treatment could maintain sustained
      viral response and the state of HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml.

      The patients with chronic hepatitis B and achieved HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml after completed
      interferon treatment will be enrolled and observed for 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg,
      anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will be measured every 3 months during the observation period,
      liver function tests were performed every 3 months also. The liver ultrasonic examination
      would be taken every 3-6 months. The primary endpoint is HBV DNA reaction. The secondary
      endpoints is HBsAg loss.

    <description>The serum HBV DNA will be tested every 3 month for 96 weeks after completed treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients who achieved serum HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml with HBV DNA undetectable by interferon therapy. The rate of sustained viral response defined HBV DNA level maintaining undetectable during observation period will be evaluated, and HBV reaction is defined as serum HBV DNA reverse back to detectable level.</description>

        the study population in this study were composed of patients who had chronic hepatitis B
        and achieved HBsAg level≤100 IU/ml with undetectable HBV DNA level after interferon
        treatment, and serum HBsAg and HBV DNA would be tested every 3 months for 96 weeks after
        finished treatment. Sustained viral response defined as serum HBV DNA maintaining
        undetectable during the observation period. HBsAg loss is defined as HBsAg level reached
        the value lower than the low limited value.
