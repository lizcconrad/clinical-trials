    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of PF-06747775 as a single agent and in combination with other
      cancer treatments in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC. The overall clinical study consists
      of a Phase 1 single agent dose-escalation and expansion part to determine the RP2D of
      PF-06747775 single agent in patients with previously-treated EGFRm NSCLC followed by
      sequential evaluations of PF-06747775 at the RP2D in 3 different clinical scenarios as
      detailed below:

        -  Cohort 1: Phase 2 evaluation of PF-06747775 as a single agent in previously untreated
           patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC,

        -  Cohort 2: Phase 1b single arm evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib
           (Cohort 2A) followed by Phase 2 randomized evaluation of PF 06747775 in combination with
           palbociclib vs PF-06747775 single agent (Cohort 2B) in previously-treated patients with
           EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M), and

        -  Cohort 3: Phase 1b evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with avelumab in
           previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and
           T790M or L858R and T790M).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There remains an unmet medical need to develop EGFR TKI agents that effectively target both
      the single activating mutations of del 19 and L858R, and the secondary resistance mutation
      T790M, while sparing WT EGFR. Drugs active against the resistance mutation will enable
      molecularly targeted therapy with a more favorable toxicity profile than the current standard
      of cytotoxic chemotherapy platinum based doublets. Furthermore, by having a wide margin of
      selectivity favoring the EGFR mutants versus WT EGFR, PF 06747775 is likely to be positioned
      to improve patient outcomes from an efficacy and safety perspective.

    <description>Cohort 1 is an evaluation of PF 06747775 single agent at RP2D Cohorts 2A and 3 will determine the RP2D of PF-06747775 in combination with either palbociclib or avelumab, respectively, based on safety and tolerability.
Determination of the RP2D will be performed using the mTPI design. For Cohort 2A, after determination of the RP2D for the PF-06747775 and palbociclib combination, a randomized evaluation of the combination vs PF-06747775 single agent (2:1 ratio) will be initiated (Cohort 2B). For Cohort 3, after determination of the RP2D for the PF-06747775 and avelumab combination, the dose level will be expanded to enroll an overall total of approximately 20 patients to further explore the safety, PK, and antitumor activity of the combination.</description>

        Evidence of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or
        metastatic EGFRm (del 19 or L858R) NSCLC:

          1. As detected by local EGFR mutation test that includes QIAGEN therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR
             kit, Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test or a sponsor-approved laboratory developed test
             that is validated in a CLIA laboratory (with tissue submitted for central laboratory
             confirmation via FDA approved QIAGEN therascreen RCQ PCR kit).

          2. T790M disease as follows:

             Phase 1 If a repeat biopsy was performed on the tumor following prior EGFR TKI
             therapy, then T790M positive disease must be present. Patients of unknown T790M status
             following EGFR TKI progression (ie, no post EGFR TKI progression biopsy was performed)
             are eligible.

             In the PK sub-studies involving food/antacid and CYP3A4 effects, patients with EGFRm
             (del 19 or L858R) with any T790M status are eligible to enroll.

             Studies at RP2D Cohort 1: Patients may have de novo T790M mutation, but it is not
             required. Cohort 2 and Cohort 3: Patients must have EGRFm (del 19 AND T790M or L858R
             AND T790M) NSCLC tumors as detected by local EGFR mutation test that includes QIAGEN
             Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit, Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test or a sponsor-approved
             laboratory developed test that is validated in a CLIA laboratory, which will then be
             retrospectively confirmed by the central validated Thermo Fisher Scientific Oncomine
             Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) cancer panel test. Patients will also be enrolled if
             they solely test positive for EGFR (del 19 AND T790M or L858R AND T790M) NSCLC in
             plasma detected by local EGFR mutation test that includes QIAGEN Therascreen EGFR
             Plasma RGQ kit, Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test v2 (US-IVD) or Sysmex Inostic's
             OncoBEAMTM EGFR test or a sponsor-approved laboratory developed test that is validated
             in a CLIA laboratory, which will then be retrospectively confirmed by a validated
             cfDNA test as determined by the Sponsor.

          3. Prior treatment for EGFRm NSCLC as follows:

        Phase 1 Has progressed after at least 1 prior line of therapy including and EGFR TKI.
        Patients may have also received other lines of therapy before or after the EGFR TKI.

        Studies at RP2D Cohort 1: no prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm
        NSCLC. Cohorts 2 and 3: must have had disease progression on treatment with an approved 1st
        or 2nd generation EGFR TKI. Patients who have been treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI
        are ineligible for this study. Patients may have had multiple lines of therapy; however,
        the last therapy prior to study treatment must have been an approved EGFR TKI and received
        within 6 weeks prior to study registration.

        Patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1 that has
        not been previously irradiated.

        Tumor tissue available. Requesting formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block or 15
        unstained sections (5 micron). If a lesser amount of tissue is available, contact the
        sponsor. An archival specimen is acceptable for Phase 1; a de novo specimen is required for
        Cohorts 2, and 3 if the T790M status was confirmed by tissue biopsy.

        Partial Exclusion Criteria:

        For All Phases/Cohorts Previously diagnosed brain metastases, unless the patient has
        completed the treatment that is clinically indicated, if any, and has recovered from the
        acute effects of any treatment that was delivered prior to study registration, have
        discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases prior to registration, and are
        neurologically stable.

        registration excluding EGFR TKIs. Patients on EGFR TKIs must discontinue the agent for a
        minimum of:

          -  2 days prior to registration for erlotinib or afatinib, or 3 days for gefitinib if
             they will be part of the lead-in single dose PF-06747775 PK study (Phase 1 Dose
             Escalation Single and Multiple dose PK and ECG Assessments; Phase 1 Sildenafil at MTD;
