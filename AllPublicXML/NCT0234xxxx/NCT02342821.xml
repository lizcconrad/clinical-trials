      Specific Aims

        1. Provide HBV education at community sites where immigrants at risk for HBV could be
           informed of the risks related to HBV, in a culturally and linguistically sensitive
           manner.

             1. Chelsea, Charlestown, and Revere MGH Community Health Centers: posters, pamphlets,
                and telephone line to provide HBV education

             2. Senegalese Community Center: community meeting, posters, and pamphlets

             3. African Students' Association, Suffolk University: community meeting, posters, and
                pamphlets

             4. Revere Cambodian Community Centers: community meeting, posters, and pamphlets

        2. Provide at-risk persons with the tools to develop an HBV diagnosis plan with his / her
           provider.

             1. Provide counseling on the significance of different testing results prior to
                testing

             2. Connect to testing, and appropriate post-test follow-up appointments

        3. Provide an education hub for patients and providers to return to with questions
           regarding: test interpretation, available treatments for those who test positive, and
           screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in those who are infected.

             1. Provide copy of an easy to understand US HBV treatment algorithm in native
                languages

             2. Provide information related to genotype-specific risks for HCC (increased with GT
                C).
