      In the field of cancer treatment, it is generally accepted that the enhancement of oxygen
      delivery to tumors can augment the effect of anti-cancer therapies. In the case of
      chemotherapy, this enhancement might lead to a larger amount of a given dose of treatment
      reaching the tumor and having an effect.

      While the benefits of exercise on overall health are widely documented, little is known about
      how exercise affects the progression or treatment of malignant neoplasms. Tumors have a
      complex vascular network which is likely affected by the global changes in hemodynamics and
      perfusion that occur during moderate exercise. Increased tumor oxygenation is clinically
      relevant as it may counteract the hypoxic tumor environment which is known to contribute to
      resistance to chemo- and radiation therapies, angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis,
      genomic instability, and resistance to cell death.

      The researcher can use noninvasive optical imaging technology called diffuse optical
      spectroscopy to safely and non-invasively quantify the dynamics of blood flow and metabolism
      in tumors and normal tissue of subjects undergoing supervised cycling exercise. The
      researcher can determine that exercise will measurably increase tumor oxygenation, and that
      this effect will be proportional to the intensity and/or duration of the exercise performed.
