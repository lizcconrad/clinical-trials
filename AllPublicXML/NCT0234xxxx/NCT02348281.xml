      This prospective, single center, phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      bicalutamide as a treatment in androgen receptor (AR)-positive metastatic triple-negative
      breast cancer (mTNBC) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as the absence of estrogen and progesterone
      receptor expression as well as ERBB2 amplification. It has no response to endocrine or
      anti-ERBB2 therapies. Recent studies have found some potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.
      However, it still has a poor outcome. It was reported that TNBC has six subtypes, including 2
      basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal
      stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Different subtype may be
      sensitive to different treatment. Bicalutamide is an oral, non-steroidal, androgen receptor
      (AR) antagonist. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment
      of metastatic prostate cancer. Recently, a study explored the efficacy of bicalutamide in AR
      positive, estrogen receptor negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which showed a high
      clinical benefit rate (CBR) and a good safety profile. Based on the above reasons, we
      initiate this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide in AR
      positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females elder than 18

          2. Histological proven unresectable or metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent at
             least one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease

          3. Patients with androgen Receptor (AR) positive (IHC &gt;10% nuclear staining) either for
             primary tumor or metastatic lesion

          4. Triple-negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progestogen receptor (PR), and human
             epithelial receptor-2 (HER2) by IHC (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1% and Her2 negative). A negative
             Her2 gene amplification should be verified by FISH test for those patients with Her2
             (2+). For those with Her2 (1+), FISH test might be considered by the investigator.
