  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in children and
      severely affects quality of life (QoL) of patients and their parents. The application of
      topical medications and emollient is the mainstay of the treatment, but complexity of the
      treatment and lack of self-care knowledge cause poor adherence, leading to therapeutic
      failure. Adequate education about the chronic disease and its treatment was known to improve
      the treatment adherence. There are a variety forms like generalized information leaflets and
      video clips for imparting information to patients and individualized tailoring education was
      considered more effective way to improve patients' adherence. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of tailored education in dermatology area, especially the emollient
      usage in patients with atopic dermatitis.
