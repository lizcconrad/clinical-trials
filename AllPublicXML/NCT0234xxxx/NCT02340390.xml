      Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of patients who received G7 Acetabular system in
      conjunction with Ceramic on Ceramic articulation and Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem
      compared to patients who received the Exceed ABT Acetabular system with the same combination

      This study will be a multi-center randomized controlled study. Eligible patients will be
      randomly assigned to receive a combination of G7 Acetabular system with CoC articulation and
      Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem or Exceed ABT Acetabular system with CoC articulation and
      Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem. Patient demographics, preoperative clinical outcomes,
      operative information, postoperative clinical outcome, radiographic assessment, incidence of
      squeaking, incidence of dislocation, implant survivorship and adverse events will be
      collected prospectively.

    <description>The Biomet G7 Acetabular System is a modular acetabular system, offering two types of acetabular shells. The shells are available in either a solid shell design, with an apical plug, or a limited hole with an apical plug and optional screw holes. Components are available in numerous designs and sizes intended for both primary and/or revision applications.</description>

    <description>The Exceed ABT Acetabular System has been designed for cementless fixation and consists of an acetabular shell and an acetabular insert. The acetabular insert/bearing includes a tapered outer geometry that matches the inner geometry of the acetabular shell and an inner hemispherical geometry to suit the varying modular head diameters. Inserts/bearings are inserted into the acetabular shell intra-operatively and are available in varying sizes to match the acetabular shell diameters. The insert/bearings are available in Biolox Delta ceramic (CeramTec AG).</description>

    <description>The Biomet G7™ Acetabular System has been designed to provide more options to surgeons for treatment of patients needing total hip arthroplasty, while concurrently simplifying the surgical process with well-designed, modular components and corresponding instruments. The G7™ Acetabular System includes three liner types; ArComXL highly-crosslinked or E-1 Vitamin E-infused polyethylnene and a Biolox Delta (Ceramtec, Plochingen, Germany) ceramic liner.</description>
