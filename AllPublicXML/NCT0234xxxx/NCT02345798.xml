    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a video-assisted intervention in improving recovery of
      patients undergoing surgery to remove lung cancer or cancer that has spread to the lung and
      their caregivers. The intervention uses educational videos to prepare patients and families
      for surgery and teach them how to manage the symptoms after surgery. Teaching patients and
      their families what to expect before and after surgery may help improve patient and caregiver
      quality of life, help patients recover better from surgery, and support families in their
      role as caregivers after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To pilot test a video-assisted intervention designed to enhance post-operative recovery by
      preparing patients and informal caregivers for lung surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe preliminary effect of the video-assisted intervention on patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs), informal caregiver-reported outcomes, and clinical/system outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their caregivers are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients and caregivers receive standard care during routine clinic visits.

      ARM II: Patients view Parts 1 and 2 of the video program, which focus on what to expect
      before surgery and after surgery in the hospital, on a tablet over approximately 8 minutes at
      a scheduled pre-operative visit. Patients then receive an educational handbook and discuss
      the video with a nurse. After surgery and before hospital discharge, patients view Part 3 of
      the video over approximately 6 minutes, which focuses on what to expect after going home.

      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up at approximately 2-4 weeks
      and 2 months.
