  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allograft transplants are offered to people with haematological cancers sometimes as the best
      chance of a cure. However, the survival rates for these procedures can be quite poor, as the
      transplant, in itself, can be lifethreatening.

      In addition, these procedures usually involve a period of lengthy hospitalisation accompanied
      by a host of debilitating conditions which patients must cope with in isolation due to their
      increased risk of serious infection. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is considerable evidence
      that mood plays a role in the way people recover.

      I wish to investigate the psychological impact of providing testimonies from survivors of
      transplants to patients undergoing the procedure.

      The plan is initially to collect about 10-15 testimonials from past transplant patients using
      a videotaped structured interview then to collate these testimonials into a booklet format
      and DVD.

      This booklet and DVD would be used as an intervention where 40 consecutive patients who are
      going ahead for transplant are invited to receive the testimonial intervention.

      Patients will be asked to complete one mood measure (the HADS), the Life Orientation Test
      (LOT), and a questionnaire about expectations of treatment in clinic once a decision to
      proceed to transplant has been made. Patients will receive the testimonies upon admittance to
      the transplant unit and then receive the HADS and a structured interview within the first
      week of being admitted to the transplant ward (just prior to receiving the transplant) and
      within the first two weeks following the transplant.

      Comparative analyses of the measures between the three time points would be performed and
      qualitative analysis of the structured interview data.

      Around 80 people undergo transplant each year, it is estimated that the project will be
      completed by September 2016. The intention would be to publish following completion.
