    <textblock>
      Physical activity exerts a variety of long-term health benefits in older adults.This
      randomised controlled trial investigates the effect of a 12-week physical exercise program on
      the change in cerebral metabolism as assessed with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging.
      Follow-up lasts for 6 months.

    <measure>Change in cerebral metabolism (assessed by MRSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by MRSI, Primary hypothesis is that aerobic exercise leads to an increase of cerebral N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA; mediated by plasma neurotrophins).
Secondary hypothesis stipulates an increase of markers of neuronal energy reserve: i.e. the ratio of phosphocreatinin to creatinine and of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP) to ~di-phosphate (ADP).
Third hypothesis is an increase in the volume of cortical grey matter</description>

    <description>During the first 4 weeks of intervention two of the three weekly training sessions are offered as group training supervised by the respective qualified exercise physiologist of the Department of Sports Medicine. After 4 weeks, participants' physical performance is reassessed at the Department of Sports Medicine. If necessary, workload is readjusted to achieve the initially defined exercise intensity.</description>
