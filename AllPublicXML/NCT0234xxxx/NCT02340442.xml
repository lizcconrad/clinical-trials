  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal obesity, overweight and hypertensive disorders are among the most important risk
      factors for complications during pregnancy. Several lines of evidence indicate that
      overweight or obese women, as well as women with hypertensive disorders show increased risks
      of preterm birth before 32 weeks. However, an easy to determine, common reliable prognostic
      factor which allows for the early identifications of risk patients is still lacking.
      Recently, it has been reported that assessment of endothelial function may be a new promising
      tool for predicting the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. As such evidence has been provided
      that endothelial dysfunction is prevalent among women with preeclampsia and is able to
      identify women at increased risk of preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age (SGA)
      births. Several lines of evidence indicate that functional and structural changes of retinal
      vessels are altered in vascular related disease and may predict cardio-vascular events.
      Consequently, the current study seeks to investigate whether flicker induced vasodilatation,
      a well established parameter to test vascular function in-vivo is altered in women with low
      and high risk pregnancies when compared to a healthy control group. The data gained from this
      study may provide the basis for a larger longitudinal trial to assess whether vascular
      changes in the retina may predict the risk for complication during pregnancy.
