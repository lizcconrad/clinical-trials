  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a responsive mobile-web app, &quot;Jauntly,&quot; which was designed to
      take advantage of the known connections between positive emotions, stress reduction and
      stress resilience. The app's goal was to lead users through research-proven positive
      emotion-enhancing exercises and relevant educational materials. Intervention activities
      covered five well-being-generating content areas: 1) promoting the experience and recognition
      of gratitude; 2) encouraging positive social relationships and feelings of social support; 3)
      improving stress resilience via mindfulness and other relaxation-focused activities; 4)
      focusing and capitalizing on individual strengths (as opposed to limitations and weaknesses);
      and 5) general positive mood inducing activities. Program content was adapted from a variety
      of stress-relevant research areas including health psychology/psychosomatic medicine,
      social/personality psychology, positive psychology, and clinical psychology.

      The overarching goal of the Jauntly mobile app was to experience exercises that encourage one
      to take care of oneself emotionally, improve positive emotions, and decrease stress and other
      negative emotions. The user interacted with the app through evidence-based activities (e.g.
      writing gratefulness notes, helping others, practicing mindfulness). The activities were
      selected based on the goals the user selected upon initiation of program and throughout
      engagement with the app. In order to promote sustained use of the program and mastery of the
      positive emotion based skills, the design of the program included activities that range in
      difficulty so that the user could progress and improve (i.e., simple &quot;1 and done&quot; types of
      goals versus multi-week goals).

      Research in positive psychology interventions suggests that increases in well-being are
      highest when the activity: 1) fits the person's interests and values and 2) is performed
      neither too frequently nor too seldom. Because of our desire to have a product with
      long-lasting usability and sustained engagement, it was critical that there were a diverse
      number of activities from which individuals could choose based on interest, current mood, and
      past success. The Jauntly user experience is structured around free use of the app partnered
      with regular emails, in-app messaging, videos, and articles. Emails remind users to utilize
      program content (including users in the control group who were reminded to visit the
      stress-management website). Use of the app and viewing of videos and other content is not
      restricted and users are able to self-tailor use according to their interest.

    <description>The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) assessed perceptions of feeling like you can not cope with things in your life and feelings of &quot;stress&quot; and nervousness on a scale of 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The PSS is the most widely used self-report stress scale available, and has been shown to predict many important well-being outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological well-being assessed as positive and negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative affect over the past few weeks was assessed at each time point using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale-expanded version, with a few nonrelevant items (e.g., surprise) removed, resulting in a total of 53 emotion adjectives on a scale of 1 (not at all/very slightly) to 5 (extremely). Subscales assessing positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) were created as well as specific basic emotion scales assessing fear (6 items), hostility (6 items), guilt (6 items), sadness (5 items), joviality (8 items), self-assuredness (6 items), attentiveness (4 items), fatigue (4 items) and serenity (3 items).</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the self-reported Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD-10). Participants are asked to rate each symptom on a scale of rarely/none of time to (1) to all of the time (4).</description>

    <description>The 10-statement UCLA Loneliness Scale asked users to respond to the root statement &quot;How often do you feelâ€¦.&quot; in conjunction with various statements describing social relationships; e.g., &quot;How often do you feel as if nobody really understands you?&quot; Responses were on a 4-point scale (1-often; 4=never)</description>

    <description>Eleven items were selected from the SF-36, a measure of functional status which contains 8 subscales. Items from 2 of the subscales were included: bodily pain and general health perceptions. Response scales were different for each of the subscales.</description>

    <description>Absenteeism and presenteeism were assessed using the Workplace Outcomes Suite. A score from a 9-item work engagement assessment including questions about hours of missed work due to absenteeism, lateness, leaving early, and questions about lost productivity due to lack of concentration or personal distractions involving disrupting phone calls, email.</description>

    <description>Treatment participants completed the System Usability Scale, a quantitative measure of program ease of use (Sauro, 2011). The scale includes 10 items and users were asked to what degree they agreed or disagreed with program use and satisfaction statements on a 6-point scale (1=strongly disagree; 6=strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>User satisfaction with the app experience</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
