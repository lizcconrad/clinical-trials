  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this project are to determine the impact of an implicit priming
      intervention, designed to alter food perceptions, on both brain responses to food and on food
      intake behaviors in overweight/obese individuals. The investigators hypothesized that this
      bottom-up sensory-level conditioning approach would effectively result in reduced preference
      for high-calorie foods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One factor that may contribute to susceptibility to obesity is a high responsivity to
      high-calorie foods in terms of cognitive factors such as emotional associations, reward value
      or reinforcing properties of food. Many of these processes involve learned associations
      thought to develop via classical conditioning through repeated pairings with external
      stimuli, which can influence food preferences and intake. As such, improving our
      understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these processes and attempting to modify
      them may be a useful strategy to promote weight loss and maintenance. Therefore, the proposed
      study aims to investigate the effects of altering food perception on neuronal responses and
      food intake behaviors by using implicit priming, in which positively or negatively valenced
      images are presented immediately prior to food images, but are not consciously perceived.

      The project goals are to determine the impact of the implicit priming intervention on both
      brain responses to food cues and on food intake behaviors in overweight/obese individuals.
      Food image ratings and neuronal responses to visual food cues will be assessed before and
      after either (a) an active implicit priming intervention or (b) a control intervention.
      Following fMRI, food intake will be measured.
