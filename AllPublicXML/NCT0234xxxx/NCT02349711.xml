  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, participants with seasonal
      allergies will receive a daily probiotic or placebo for 8 weeks. Questionnaires will assess
      health-related quality of life, stress, physical activity, gastrointestinal symptoms, adverse
      events, and compliance. In a subset of subjects, stool and blood samples will be collected at
      baseline and at week 6 of the intervention (estimated to be peak allergy season) to
      characterize microbial communities and immune function.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from the Gainesville, FL area, including the University of Florida campus. Recruiting began in January of 2015 and took place in facilities within the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department at the University of Florida. Participants were enrolled from 1-20-15 to 3-12-15.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Before randomization, participants provided anthropometric measurements and demographic information. Out of the 224 participants who consented to participate, only 173 remained at randomization due to the participants no longer being interested or not coming to their study visits to be randomized.</pre_assignment_details>
