      The first aim of the study is to prove that after starting the therapy with crushed tablets,
      the platelet inhibition will be as expected after starting therapy with intact tablets.
      Gurbel et al. showed that 100% of the patients on ticagrelor treatment have a decrease from
      baseline platelet aggregation of &gt;10% 4 hours after last maintenance dose. So the
      investigators expect that after 3 days of treatment, all of our patients will have a closing
      time of more than 106seconds.

      The investigators will observe two different clinical conditions of Acute Coronary Syndrome.
      First after semi-urgent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, secondly in patients
      after cardiac arrest.

      Both are clinical situations in which crushed tablets are needed to give. The second
      objective is to determine plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (active
      metabolite of ticagrelor) in these two patient populations after receiving 180mg or 90mg
      start-dose. Determination of plasma concentrations is done after protein precipitation, by
      using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Measurements will be determined
      before intake (0h) and at 0,5; 1; 2; 4; 8; 24h and at day 4 +4h.7 The first 24h this will be
      a crushed tablet and 4 hours after the first intake at day 4 of therapy, this will be a non
      crushed tablet.

      This study is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised longitudinal study in which the
      effect of ticagrelor, both crushed and non-crushed will be evaluated in two separate clinical
      conditions. The plasma concentrations after a crushed intake will be used to determine the
      maximum plasma concentration and time to achieve this maximum concentration.

      50 patients of each condition:

      Condition A: patients who received CPR because of cardiac arrest. A gastric tube is inserted.
      Subjects receive 2 crushed tablets of ticagrelor (180mg) with 10 ml water and a flush of 20
      ml water. The first blood sample is taken before administration. The following samples are
      taken at 30minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h. The ninth sample is taken 24 hours after
      stopping sedation and 4h after administration of ticagrelor with 10 ml water and a flush of
      20 ml water via nasogastric tube. The tenth sample is taken 4 days and 4hours after first
      intake of ticagrelor, this last sample is mostly after a non-crushed intake of ticagrelor
      (this depends on the neurological condition of the patient). Only the first dose is a loading
      dose of 180mg, hereafter a normal dose of 90mg is given.

      At each blood sampling moment 1 or 2 samples are taken (see also flow chart). At time 0, 2,
      4, 8, 12, 24h, 24h after sedation stop and at 4 days and 4hours after first intake of
      ticagrelor: a Platelet Function Analysis and an Aggreguide aggregometry is done. For each
      analysis 3,6ml of blood is needed, this makes a total of 28,8ml for the clotting analyses. At
      time 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24h and 4 days and 4h; 4ml of blood is needed for the plasma
      concentration measurements, a total of 28ml.

      Condition B: Patients in need of semi-urgent coronary bypass surgery, allowing interrupting
      the administration of ticagrelor 3 days before surgery. A nasogastric tube is inserted during
      surgery. On intensive care the patients will receive crushed tablets of ticagrelor with 10 ml
      water and a flush of 20 ml water via gastric tube, the first dose will be a loading dose. The
      first blood sample is taken just before surgery (weak effect of ticagrelor because
      administration has stopped 3 days). The following samples are taken at 30minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8,
      12, and 24h. The ninth sample is taken 24 hours after stopping sedation and 4h after
      administration of ticagrelor with 10 ml water and a flush of 20 ml water via nasogastric
      tube. The tenth sample is taken 4 days and 4hours after first intake of ticagrelor, this last
      sample is mostly after a non-crushed intake of ticagrelor (this depends on the neurological
      condition of the patient). Only the first dose is a loading dose of 180mg, hereafter a normal
      dose of 90mg is given.

      At each blood sampling moment 1 or 2 samples are taken (see also flow chart). At time 0, 2,
      4, 8, 12, 24h, 24h after sedation stop and at 4 days and 4hours after first intake of
      ticagrelor: a Platelet Function Analysis and an Aggreguide aggregometry is done. For each
      analysis 3,6ml of blood is needed, this makes a total of 25,2ml for the clotting analyses. At
      time 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24h and 4 days and 4h; 4ml of blood is needed for the plasma
      concentration measurements, a total of 28ml.

    <description>Patients, after CPR because of an ACS, will receive 2 crushed tablets of ticagrelor (180mg) through a gastric tube. After this dose twice a day 90mg is given for the duration of 1 year. The 1st blood sample is taken before administration. In total 10 blood samples are taken for determination of platelet aggregation and plasma concentrations.
When patients receive a semi-urgent CABG, ticagrelor has been interrupted for 3 days. Postoperative the patients get crushed tablets of ticagrelor, the 1st dose will be 90mg, and every 12h 90mg is given, for the duration of 1 year. The 1st blood sample is taken before the 1st dose. In total 9 blood samples are taken for determination of platelet aggregation and plasma concentrations.</description>
