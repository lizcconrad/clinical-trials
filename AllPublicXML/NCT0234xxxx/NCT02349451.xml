    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active- and
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability,
      efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of multiple doses of ABT-122 in participants

    <description>Percentage of participants with an ACR20 response, defined as at least 20% improvement (compared to baseline values) in tender and swollen joint counts and at least 20% improvement in 3 of the remaining 5 core set measures (subject global assessment of pain, subject global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity, subject assessment of physical function and acute phase reactant high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]). Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agresti-Coull method.</description>

    <measure>ACRn at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ACR measures percentage improvements in tender and swollen joint counts, patient assessments of pain, global disease activity and physical function, physician global assessment of disease activity and acute phase reactant. ACRn is a continuous variable based on the ACR criteria. Improvement from baseline in a component of the ACR composite variable was computed as the difference between the baseline value and the value at a given post-baseline visit. A positive value for improvement from baseline for an individual component indicates lesser severity of disease. The 95% confidence interval for mean is constructed using T-statistic with significance level alpha=5%.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28[hsCRP]) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PASDAS is a continuous compound disease activity state score determined by the combined values of tender or swollen joint counts, participant-reported outcome and hsCRP lab test. The PASDAS is unitless, with a typical score range between 0 and 10. Smaller values on PASDAS indicate a better condition; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Target Lesion Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Target lesion score for psoriasis in participants with psoriatic arthritis is calculated by adding the scores of plaque erythema, scaling and thickness. Scores range from 0 (no erythema or evidence of plaque thickness) to 10 (severe erythema and evidence of plaque thickness).</description>

          -  Have active psoriasis defined by at least 1 psoriasis lesion &gt;= 2 cm diameter in areas
             other than the axilla or groin.

          -  Have active arthritis defined by minimum disease activity criteria:

               1. &gt;= 3 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) at Screening

               2. &gt;= 3 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening

          -  On a stable dose of methotrexate (MTX) defined as:

               1. Oral or parenteral treatment &gt;= 3 months

               4. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x the ULN

               5. Platelets &lt; 100,000 cells/[mm^3] (10^9/L),

        <title>ACRn at Week 12</title>
        <description>ACR measures percentage improvements in tender and swollen joint counts, patient assessments of pain, global disease activity and physical function, physician global assessment of disease activity and acute phase reactant. ACRn is a continuous variable based on the ACR criteria. Improvement from baseline in a component of the ACR composite variable was computed as the difference between the baseline value and the value at a given post-baseline visit. A positive value for improvement from baseline for an individual component indicates lesser severity of disease. The 95% confidence interval for mean is constructed using T-statistic with significance level alpha=5%.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28[hsCRP]) at Week 12</title>
          <description>The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.</description>

        <description>PASDAS is a continuous compound disease activity state score determined by the combined values of tender or swollen joint counts, participant-reported outcome and hsCRP lab test. The PASDAS is unitless, with a typical score range between 0 and 10. Smaller values on PASDAS indicate a better condition; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

      <desc>A TEAE is defined as any AE with onset or worsening reported by a participant from the time that the first dose of adalimumab or ABT-122 is administered until 5 half-lives (70 days) have elapsed following discontinuation of adalimumab or ABT-122 administration. TEAEs were collected whether elicited or spontaneously reported by the participant.</desc>
