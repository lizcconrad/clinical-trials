    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of the intra-articular injection of TissueGene-C in
      patients with degenerative arthritis of the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of non-transduced chondrocytes and
      transduced chondrocytes that express Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1 to regenerate the
      damaged cartilage.

      During the clinical trial Phase 2A, we compare low dose or high dose TissueGene-C in 6 months
      trial with 28 outpatients who have degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized to two
      dose levels of TisssueGene-C by 1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded for
      alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse
      events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 45 years or more

          2. With grade 4 degenerative arthritis of the knee [based on the International Cartilage
             Repair Society(ICRS) evaluation criteria from the MRI results]

          3. With less than 6 cm2major lesions

          4. With major lesions (grade 4) concentrated in only one section of the knee and
             considered the main cause of the clinical symptoms

          5. Unresponsive to conventional symptomatic treatment

          6. Healthy and with no major physical examination, hematology, serum chemistry, and urine
             test findings and no significant medical history

          7. Agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the study period

                  insipidus, Cushing's disease)

               -  insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
