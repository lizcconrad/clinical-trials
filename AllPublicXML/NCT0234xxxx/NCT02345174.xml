  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) expression is seen across a wide variety of
      solid malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis. Up-regulation of HER3 expression
      and activity is also associated with resistance to multiple pathway inhibitors. GSK2849330, a
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting HER3, is a new agent for subjects whose tumors express
      HER3. This study aims to characterise the biodistribution and dose-receptor occupancy
      relationship of GSK2849330 in patients with advanced HER3 expressing solid tumours via the
      use of PET imaging. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will be the imaging
      phase where each subject will receive two doses of GSK2849330 containing both Zirconium-89
      (89Zr) labelled GSK2849330 and unlabeled GSK2849330. The amount of unlabeled GSK2849330
      present in each dose will be varied to explore the effect on target mediated uptake of 89Zr
      into HER3 expressing tissues and tumors. Subjects will then proceed to the continuation phase
      (Part 2) for continued treatment with unlabelled GSK2849330. The study is planned to enroll
      approximately 12-15 subjects.
