  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide knowledge regarding the effect of early intervention
      and prevention on the development of anxiety and depression in children. The focus of the
      intervention is to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and help children develop skills
      to enhance self-esteem in order to improve life quality. Gender and ethnicity will be studied
      as moderating factors. Primary care givers will be trained in the use of evidence based
      methods for children with internalizing difficulties. Children in need will be identified and
      receive improved services, based on international standards. Active collaboration will be
      established nationally between three Centers for child and adolescent mental health
      (RKBU/RBUP) and internationally with Philip C. Kendall at the Temple University in
      Philadelphia and Kevin Stark at University of Texas at Austin.

      Primary aims are to examine if an indicated group and school based program, Coping Kids, is
      more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing high levels of symptoms of both
      anxiety and depression among 8-12 year old schoolchildren, and if the the effects are stable
      over 12 months.

    <description>A Program for Managing Anxiety and Depression (P.C Kendall et al., 2013) is a newly developed group intervention targeting children aged 8 to 13 years who experience difficulty with symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both. The program is designed as an indicated prevention intervention to reduce the symptom levels and reduce the likelihood of the development of an anxiety disorder and/or depression.
The youth-focused sessions are designed for implementation in school settings, and the program includes parent group meetings.
All groupleaders participate in a three days training, followed by supervision. Manuals and workbooks are provided by the project. In addition is the same presentation as in TAU offered to the schools.</description>

    <description>The teachers and school-nurses in the control schools will conduct treatment as usual (TAU).The project offers a 2,5 hours presentation to the schools, providing general information about the research study, the prevalence of emotional disorders and how to handle emotional disorders in treatment as usual.

    <intervention_name>Coping Kids</intervention_name>
    <description>The first half (10 sessions) of Coping Kids focuses on building skills that are common to both anxiety and depression. The children practice strategies to regulate their mood, learn problem-solving, and behavioral activation is used to break the cycle of withdrawal. The second half of Coping Kids (10 sessions) is focused on the youth's specific problem; for depressive symptoms, building a positive self-schema and behavioral activation; for anxiety problems, gradual exposure to fear-inducing situations. Cognitive restructuring directed at different maladaptive thoughts is also emphasized.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children at the intervention schools indicating a symptom level of, at minimum, one

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who for different reasons may not benefit from a group-process intervention
             (e.g. mental retardation) will be considered individually and the reasons for
