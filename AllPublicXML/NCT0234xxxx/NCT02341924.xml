  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to investigate the ability to affect cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risk factors through a novel, easily implemented functional food-based
      approach. The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the effect of a range of
      proprietary products specifically formulated to deliver convenient pre-packaged
      condition-specific foods to positively impact blood cholesterol levels in statin intolerant
      and/or statin unwilling participants. The specific aim of this project is to evaluate the
      changes in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride (TG) glucose,
      insulin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations over a 4 week regimen
      using healthy tasty foods which are self-selected by a statin intolerant patient group.

    <description>A portfolio of functional foods provided as packaged shelf-stable food products (Step One Treatment) which will include foods such as oatmeal, pancakes, cranberry bars, chocolate bars, smoothies, and a sprinkle offering which can be added to almost any food to enhance its nutritional impact.
All products are interchangeable in terms of their nutrients of interest and contain a minimum of 5 g of fibre, 1800 mg of omega-3 fatty acids, 1000 mg of phytosterols and 1800 Âµmol antioxidants per serving. Calorie counts range from 110-190 kcal per serving.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants aged &gt; 21 to &lt; 65 years will be recruited on the basis of ability to give
        informed consent and being unwilling to use or intolerant of at-least one statin
        medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they are unable to speak/read in English or are unable or
        unwilling to temporarily hold all statin/lipid lowering therapies including supplements
        throughout the study period.

        Participants with diabetes or severe obesity (body mass index, BMI, &gt; 35 kg/m2) will be
        excluded.

        Women who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant during the study period will not be
        eligible for the study.

        religious or philosophical reason - including Kosher, vegan, vegetarian, high protein,
        low-carbohydrate, low-phosphorus, etc. other than attempting to follow an eating plan as
        generally advocated by the American Heart Association (low sodium, low cholesterol, reduced
        fat, etc.) will be excluded.

        Participants will not be eligible if their baseline fasting LDL-C is &lt; 100 mg/dL or &gt; 190
        mg/dL; or evidence of tissue cholesterol deposition; if their baseline fasting TG is &gt; 400
        mg/dL or baseline fasting blood glucose is &gt; 126 mg/dL.

        Consumption of more than 2 alcoholic drink/day or history of alcoholism or drug dependence
        will also serve as an exclusion criterion.

        chronic rheumatologic condition, history of advanced cardiovascular disease (moderate or
        greater valvular disease, history congestive heart failure, known coronary artery disease,
        history dysrhythmias requiring medical or surgical intervention), , known chronic liver or
        renal disease, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, uncontrolled thyroid
        disease, hormonal supplementation(other than thyroid), pancreatitis, gallbladder or biliary
        disease, neurological/psychological disease, and gastrointestinal disorders that could
