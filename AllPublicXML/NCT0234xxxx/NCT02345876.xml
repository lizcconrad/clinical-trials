  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of central auditory processing disorders has been advanced to explain the
      anomalies of the grapheme/phoneme combination in some dyslexia. These phonological disorders
      may be linked to abnormalities of the efferent (medial olivocochlear) system modulation and
      of cortical asymmetry. Indeed, the efferent system has an asymmetry in relation to
      handedness. Thus, in right-handed subject, it is predominant on the right side. In contrast,
      in the subject-handed dyslexic, the efferent system tends to be right-lateralized or
      non-lateralized. However, after an audio-visual training, normal lateralization can appear.
      This maturation of the efferent system lateralization during reading acquisition seems to
      have a particular profile in dyslexics with phonological disorder, especially if it is
      persistent. This finding allows to consider new prognostic evaluation and speech therapy
      rehabilitation in the dyslexic child.

    <description>The change of the Asymmetry Index of the efferent system The Asymmetry Index is the difference between the equivalent attenuation measured on the right ear and the left ear. Evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded monaurally at five stimulus intensities ranging from 57 to 69 dB SPL in 3 dB steps, in random presentation order, with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation consisting of 30 dBSPL continuous broadband noise (speech-like noise) produced by an audiometer</description>
