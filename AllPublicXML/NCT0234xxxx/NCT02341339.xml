      Prospective Feasibility Study:

      Fallopian tube cells will be obtained from patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery during
      their surgical evaluation of infertility. Of note, these patients are already scheduled to
      undergo surgery as part of their standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical technique will involve laparoscopic brush and tissue biopsies of the fallopian
      tube lumen. A small piece of the fallopian tube lining will be removed during the surgery.The
      biopsy is a minimally invasive and relatively pain free procedure. Co culture blood serum
      will be drawn at least one day prior to the biopsy and during the IVF cycle. The fallopian
      tube sample is sent to the Center for Reproductive Medicine (CRM) lab where it is treated,
      purified and frozen. The next month or whenever the physician deems appropriate, the patient
      will then undergo a typical IVF cycle and will be given standard medication protocol
      determined by her physician to stimulate egg growth in her ovaries. The patient's eggs will
      be retrieved and mixed with sperm. At this time, the lab will begin to thaw and grow the
      fallopian tube cells. Once fertilization is confirmed, the patient's embryos will be placed
      on top of her own (now thawed) fallopian tube cells and allowed to grow. Subsequently, the
      embryos will be placed on top of her uterus for implantation and pregnancy.
