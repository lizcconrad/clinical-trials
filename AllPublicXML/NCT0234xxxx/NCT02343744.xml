  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CNTO1959
      (Guselkumab) in the treatment of participants with GPP or EP. Participants will receive 50
      milligram (mg) guselkumab subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. At Week 16 up to Week 52
      participants who will be defined &quot;Very much improved&quot; or &quot;Much improved&quot; in Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) will continue to receive guselkumab 50 mg every 8 weeks from Week 20 to the
      study end (Week 52). At each visit timing from Week 20, participants who will be defined &quot;No
      change&quot; or &quot;Worsened&quot; will receive guselkumab 100 mg and continue 100 mg every 8 weeks dosing
      until Week 52. Participants who are &quot;Minimally improved&quot; will also receive guselkumab 100 mg
      only if investigator considers it necessary. Participants will primarily be assessed for the
      treatment success. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16, 28, 36, 48 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score less than (&lt;) 6 indicates that psoriasis has small or no effect at all on participant's life. In addition to evaluating overall quality of life (QOL) can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment.</description>

    <description>Investigator's global assessment (IGA) score is Investigator's assessment of the participant's psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 to 72.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical and Mental Component Summary Scores of SF-36 Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16, 28, 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) having 2 measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). It consists of 8 subscales. The PCS is represented by 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. PCS and MCS scores are constructed as a T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 and no minimum or maximum score; higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Psoriasis (PSO) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16, 28, 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). The WPAI questionnaire is used to measure productivity loss associated with psoriasis during the past 7 days. It consists of six questions about absence from work because of psoriasis, hours actually worked, reduction in productivity at work attributed to psoriasis and reduction in productivity while performing daily activities. This instrument generates four scores between 0 and 100: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced productivity while working), work productivity loss (overall work impairment /absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment, which were expressed in percentage of impairment.</description>
