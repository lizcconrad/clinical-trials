      This study evaluates the combination of trametinib and pazopanib in patients with advanced
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trametinib and pazopanib are independently approved for other cancers. Both drugs work to
      inhibit tumor development in different ways. Combining these drugs may lead to improved
      disease control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of
      both drugs on advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

             within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Fertile men and women of childbearing potential must
             agree to use effective contraception as defined in Section 7 during the study and for
             4 months following the last dose of study drugs in both sexes.

             patients who have previously-treated CNS metastases (surgery +/- radiotherapy,
             radiosurgery, or gamma knife) and who meet both of the following criteria:

        are asymptomatic and have no requirement for steroids or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants in
        at least 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for
             gastrointestinal bleeding

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption of
             investigational product
