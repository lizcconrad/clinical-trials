  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative Cognitive Disorders (POCD) are common in hospitalized people &gt; 60 year old,
      especially in orthopedic patients. Etiology of POCD is complex, and in some aspects still
      remains unclear. The role of thromboembolic events in etiology of POCD was discussed. The
      incidence of such events in patients who underwent big joints arthroplasty can be as high as
      40 to 60%, although some cases are subclinical. Thromboembolic material can block a blood
      flow through a vessels in the brain. As a consequence cerebral neurons can be damaged or
      destroyed. After neuronal damage specific substances, such as S100B protein, glial fibrillary
      acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) are released to the blood. The serum
      concentrations of these biomarkers can be measured. Moreover, the block of blood flow will
      decrease regional cerebral saturation in affected parts of the brain.

      In this project the authors would like to analyze the correlation between the regional
      cerebral saturation and serum concentration of both S100B protein and GFAP in orthopedic
      patients scheduled to primary hip arthroplasty.
