  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US obesity epidemic is being transmitted to the next generation. Growing evidence
      suggests that both a mothers' weight at pregnancy onset, and excessive weight gain during
      pregnancy, are associated with increased risk of pregnancy-related complications such as
      gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, and an increased risk that her child will become
      obese and face obesity-related health issues in later life.

      Currently, over one-third of reproductive-aged women in the U.S. are obese [body mass index
      (BMI) ≥ 30]. Our research team has shown that we can improve birth weight outcomes in babies
      of obese women who start a weight-management intervention program at 14 to 15 weeks of their
      pregnancy (soon after their first prenatal visit). However, organogenesis and metabolic
      programming begin early in the first trimester, well before the first prenatal visit.
      Therefore, waiting to address mothers' weight, physical activity, and diet quality until the
      first prenatal visit is not optimal. Given the need to reach overweight and obese women prior
      to pregnancy, and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) recent recommendation, based on
      observational studies, that women should reach a healthy weight before conceiving, this
      randomized clinical trial will evaluate a comprehensive preconception weight loss program.

      The goals are to help overweight and obese women (BMI ≥ 27) who are considering pregnancy to
      adopt improved dietary and physical activity habits and lose weight prior to becoming
      pregnant, and then help them maintain those habits and prevent excessive weight gain during
      their pregnancy. We model this intervention after successful, frequent-contact interventions
      designed by ourselves and other investigators. We start with face-to-face counseling followed
      by frequent telephone counseling contacts. The expected outcomes for mothers include reduced
      pregnancy-related weight gain (primary) and lower weight at the start of pregnancy
      (secondary) and for babies, decreased risk of exceeding national norms for weight at birth
      (secondary).
