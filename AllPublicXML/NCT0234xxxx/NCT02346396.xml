  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the analgesic effect of tDCS in neuropathic chronic
      pain, to estimate the importance and the duration of this effect, and to improve its
      efficiency by the use at home.

      It is established that the repetition of the sessions of cortical stimulation over a week
      improves their analgesic efficacy. However, this effect does not exceed a few weeks and is
      much lower than that of the stimulation implanted surgically. Implanted stimulation operates
      periodically, several times a day, and this &quot;repetition of doses &quot;, akin to the regular
      taking of a medicine, may explain its longer efficacy for pain relief which, may extend over
      several years (André-Obadia and al 2014).

      No study at this date has estimated the long-term effect of non-invasive stimulation when is
      also periodically repeated on a daily basis, over several weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Patients from 18 to 80 years old, men or women, suffering pharmaco-resistant
             neuropathic chronic pain for more than one year; NVS &gt; 2 during the week S0)
             unilateral pharmacoresistant, whose analgesic treatment is stable for at least 1
             month.

          -  Patients whose pharmacoresistance leads their referent doctor to consider
             non-pharmacological therapeutic alternatives and begin a presurgical assessment.

          -  Patients having an operational Internet connection. The patient or one person of its
             circle of acquaintances will have to be able to connect on the Internet and to reach
             by this way the system of relocated stimulation (&quot;The Cloud&quot;).

          -  Patients having shown pain relief to a single- or whole-week sessions of tDCS are not
             excluded from potential recruitment for this study.

          -  Patients having a social security cover.

          -  Patients having given their written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria :

          -  History

          -  of addiction to drugs,

          -  of epilepsy.

          -  Présence of an intra-cranial ferromagnetic equipment or of an implanted stimulation
             device (e.g. stimulating, central grey pacemaker, stimulation of the basal ganglia or
             of the vagus nerve).

          -  Introduction of a new analgesic treatment for less than a month.

          -  Lack of a effective contraception for all the duration of the study for the patients
             old enough to procreate.

        (No limitation in the inclusion of male patients old enough to procreate).

          -  Patient under legal protective measure.

          -  Pregnant women and nursing mothers
