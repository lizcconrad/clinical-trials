  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will test the effectiveness of a multi-modal behavioral intervention (the
      Oral Health 4 Life program) targeted to smokers who are ready to quit smoking and seeking
      services through tobacco quitlines.

      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to people in the control arm, participants in
      the enhanced intervention will:

        1. Be more likely to quit smoking as evidenced by 7 day point prevalent abstinence rates at
           6 month follow-up [primary outcome] and at 2 month follow-up [secondary outcome].

        2. Be more likely to see a dental care professional in the past 6 months at 6 month
           follow-up [primary outcome].

        3. Exhibit more positive change in relevant oral health knowledge/beliefs and attitudes
           (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation) that could influence future behavior change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers (n = 722; 10 pilot participants and 712 main trial participants) will be recruited
      when they call to enroll in services with their state-supported tobacco quitline program.
      Eligible smokers who provide consent and complete the baseline assessment will be randomized
      to either usual care quitline intervention plus attention-matched text messaging or an
      enhanced program which integrates standard tobacco cessation counseling with a multi-modal,
      behavioral oral health promotion program.

      Follow-up assessments will be conducted by phone at 2 and 6 months post-enrollment. In
      addition to examining primary and secondary outcomes of interest (focused on tobacco
      cessation and utilization of professional dental care), change in potentially relevant
      intermediate process measures and the incremental cost of delivering the Oral Health 4 Life
      program will be examined.

    <measure>Change in Oral Health Knowledge Scale Score From Baseline to 2 Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Oral health knowledge was assessed via the Brennan et al. 2010 scale, adapted from the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire (1985 NHIS; Corbin et al). Seven questions make up the scale:
Seeing a dentist regularly Drinking water with fluoride Regular brushing of teeth Regular flossing of teeth Using fluoride toothpaste Avoiding sweets between meals.
Responses and scoring to the adapted NHIS scale:
Definitely not important = 1 Probably not important = 2 Neutral = 3 Probably important = 4 Definitely important = 5
Scale scores are calculated by summing the responses to the 7 items, with higher scores indicating higher oral health knowledge.
The scores have a range of 7 (minimum) to 35 (maximum).
The study outcome is the change in this score between BL and 2 mos. The outcome is the difference in scores. A positive score indicates an increase in oral health knowledge (larger=better). A negative score indicates a decrease in knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy (SE) for Seeing a Dentist, From Baseline to 2 Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>SE to see a dentist was assessed using the following question:
&quot;As of today, how confident are you that you can…See a dentist in the next 6 months?&quot;
Responses were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=&quot;Not at all confident&quot;, to 5=&quot;Very confident&quot;. Higher scores represented higher SE.
The study outcome is the change in this score, between baseline and the 2-month follow-up. Therefore, the outcome is defined as the difference in score. The theoretical range for the change score is -4 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), with positive scores indicating an increase in self-efficacy, and negative scores indicating a decrease in self-efficacy.</description>

        <title>Change in Oral Health Knowledge Scale Score From Baseline to 2 Month Follow up</title>
        <description>Oral health knowledge was assessed via the Brennan et al. 2010 scale, adapted from the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire (1985 NHIS; Corbin et al). Seven questions make up the scale:
Seeing a dentist regularly Drinking water with fluoride Regular brushing of teeth Regular flossing of teeth Using fluoride toothpaste Avoiding sweets between meals.
Responses and scoring to the adapted NHIS scale:
Definitely not important = 1 Probably not important = 2 Neutral = 3 Probably important = 4 Definitely important = 5
Scale scores are calculated by summing the responses to the 7 items, with higher scores indicating higher oral health knowledge.
The scores have a range of 7 (minimum) to 35 (maximum).
The study outcome is the change in this score between BL and 2 mos. The outcome is the difference in scores. A positive score indicates an increase in oral health knowledge (larger=better). A negative score indicates a decrease in knowledge.</description>

        <title>Change in Self-efficacy (SE) for Seeing a Dentist, From Baseline to 2 Month Follow up</title>
        <description>SE to see a dentist was assessed using the following question:
&quot;As of today, how confident are you that you can…See a dentist in the next 6 months?&quot;
Responses were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=&quot;Not at all confident&quot;, to 5=&quot;Very confident&quot;. Higher scores represented higher SE.
The study outcome is the change in this score, between baseline and the 2-month follow-up. Therefore, the outcome is defined as the difference in score. The theoretical range for the change score is -4 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), with positive scores indicating an increase in self-efficacy, and negative scores indicating a decrease in self-efficacy.</description>

          <title>Change in Motivation for Seeing a Dentist, From Baseline to 2-month Follow-up</title>
          <description>Motivation to see a dentist was assessed using the following question:
&quot;As of today, how motivated are you to…see a dentist in the next 6 months?&quot;
Responses were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=&quot;Not at all motivated&quot;, to 5=&quot;Very motivated&quot;. Higher scores represented higher motivation.
The study outcome is the change in this score, between baseline and the 2-month follow-up. Therefore, the outcome is defined as the difference in score.
The theoretical range for the change score is -4 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), with positive scores indicating an increase in motivation, and negative scores indicating a decrease in motivation.</description>
