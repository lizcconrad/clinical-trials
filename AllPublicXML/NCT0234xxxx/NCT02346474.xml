      Background:

      - It is important for doctors to know how much fat a person has in his or her body. Machines
      called DXAs measure how much fat mass and fat-free mass a person has. Researchers in this
      study have a new DXA machine, and they want to know if it measures body fat as well as the
      old machine. They also want to see how body fat readings from the new DXA compare to readings
      from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

      Objectives:

      - To see if two DXA machines give the same results when measuring body fat. Also, to know
      whether the DXA and MRI give the same results in measuring visceral and subcutaneous fat.

      Eligibility:

      - People 18 years and older who weigh less than 350 pounds.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Women will have
           a pregnancy test. Researchers will make sure participants are able to have an MRI if
           they volunteered to.

        -  Participants will have their body fat measured by each DXA scanner. They will lie
           quietly on a padded table while being scanned. The scan uses X-rays to take pictures of
           the body. Both scans will be done on the same morning and will take 10-15 minutes on
           both machines.

        -  Some participants also will have their body fat measured with MRI. They will lie in a
           long, tube-shaped scanner. The machine uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to
           take pictures of internal organs. Participants will sign an additional consent form for
           this procedure.

      Our Research unit (NIDDK) recently acquired a new x-ray unit (the General Electric (GE) Lunar
      iDXA) for measurement of body composition (how much fat someone has as a percent of their
      weight). This machine provides clearer and crisper images. The unit also has a larger table
      to allow patients up to 450 lbs (204 kg) to be scanned. The larger table allows for easier
      positioning of tall and heavy patients. We would like to use this new machine in the future
      but want to see whether our current DXA unit (the Lunar Prodigy Densitometer by GE) and the
      Lunar iDXA Densitometer (GE) measure the same percentage of a person s body fat. If there are
      measurement differences between the two machines, we will develop a way to convert the new
      results to more closely match the results from the current DXA unit. Thus, in this study, we
      will be asking volunteers to undergo scanning for measurement of body fat on both machines on
      the same day.

      Fat within the belly which is around organs (called visceral fat or VAT) is linked to more
      bad health outcomes than fat which is just underneath the skin (called subcutanoues fat or
      SAT). Along with standardizing the DXA - body composition measurement results we would like
      to compare VAT and SAT estimates from iDXA with values obtained by MRI. The precise MRI
      measurements completely avoid radiation exposure for the volunteers but are far more time
      consuming. Knowing that the results of iDXA match up with or correlate with the MRI results
      would allow us to use iDXA measurements to estimate visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue
      depots in ongoing and the future studies.
