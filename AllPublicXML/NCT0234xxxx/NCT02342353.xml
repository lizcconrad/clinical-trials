    <measure>Dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) - Phase I only</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of cycle 1 of all Phase I patients (estimated to be 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.
A patient is evaluable for DLT assessment only during Cycle 1 of treatment. If the patient is not able to be treated on Day 1 of Cycle 2, then s/he is still considered in Cycle 1 active treatment and can experience a DLT. Once the patient has been treated in Cycle 2, s/he will no longer be evaluated for DLTs in all subsequent cycles.</description>

    <measure>Response rate - Phase II only</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Partial response + complete response per RECIST 1.1 criteria
Study terminated prior to enrolling any phase II participants
Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (toxicities)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post completion of treatment (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients who achieve complete response, partial response, or stable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease (PD) = at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable locally advanced
             NSCLC with known sensitive EGFR mutations. Patients with mutations in T790M are
             eligible if they have progressed after treatment with a third generation EGFR tyrosine
             kinase inhibitor (osimertinib), but otherwise patients must have EGFR T790M negative
             or unknown status. Patients previously treated with third generation EGFR tyrosine
             kinase inhibitor must have achieved a treatment benefit of at least 4 months.

             biologic composition to pacritinib or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with pacritinib. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer within one week of pacritinib

             will be excluded if they have ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of CTCAE grade ≥ 3,
             corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation &gt;450ms, or other factors that increase the
             risk for QT interval prolongation (eg, heart failure, hypokalemia [defined as serum
             potassium &lt;3.0mEq/L that is persistent and refractory to correction], or family

             of oral medication such as ongoing grade 3 or higher diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
             or vomiting.

          -  Active viral hepatitis.
