  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess the feasibility and patient acceptance
      of a Home Automated Telemanagement (HAT) system in multiple sclerosis patients.

      Our hypothesis is that home telemanagement will be effective and useful in the rehabilitation
      of multiple sclerosis patients. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that home
      telemanagement using a daily exercise diary, monitoring of compliance with a tailored
      exercise program and regular assessment of strength and motor functions will: 1. Be feasible
      and acceptable in patients with multiple sclerosis 2. Improve patient compliance with home
      exercise program 3. Increase patient mobility and motor functions 4. Be a feasible and
      effective mechanism for affecting multiple sclerosis patient self-efficacy 5. Improve quality
      of life

    <measure>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>BBS consists of 14 activities common in daily life and is designed to measure balance in a clinical setting. The patient is asked to perform a task or to sustain a given position for a specific time. Points are deducted if the patient did not fulfill the time or activity requirements or touched an external support or received assistance from the examiner. Each item is rated from 0 to 4, 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 indicating the highest level of function. The total score sums up to 56. A score of 45 or above implies that an individual can safely move or walk independently.</description>

    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was developed for rating overall disability in MS. Patients are graded on the basis of presenting symptoms in eight different functional systems (FS), including pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, mental, and other functions. Scoring of the EDSS uses a 0 to 10, 20-step scale, with 0 equal to normal neurological function, 6.0 requires an assistive device for walking and 10.0 equal to death due to MS. The final score is based on grades obtained in the FS assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9-Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Measures finger dexterity
Administered by asking the patient to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible
Patients must then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container
The board should be placed at the patient's midline, with the container holding the pegs oriented towards the hand being tested
Only the hand being evaluated should perform the test
Hand not being evaluated is permitted to hold the edge of the board in order to provide stability
Scores are based on the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds
Alternative scoring - the number of pegs placed in 50 or 100 seconds can be recorded. In this case, results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second
Stopwatch should be started from the moment the participant touches the first peg until the moment the last peg hits the container</description>

    <measure>Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. It was developed by Gronwell in 1977 and later adapted by Rao and colleagues in 1989 for use in MS. The PASAT is presented using audio cassette tape or compact disk to ensure standardization in the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. Shorter inter-stimulus intervals, e.g., 2 seconds or less have also been used with the PASAT but tend to increase the difficulty of the task. Two alternate forms have been developed to minimize possible familiarity with the stimulus items when the PASAT is repeated over more than one occasion.</description>

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is used to measure fatigue. The scale consists of 21 items, with 10 items related to mental fatigue, and 11 items relating to physical and social fatigue. The scoring ranges between 0 and 82, a high score reflecting greater impact. In the literature, a cut-off value of 38 has been used to discriminate fatigued from non-fatigued patients. It has shown good validity when compared with the Fatigue Severity Scale, but also appears to be more sensitive to the cognitive and psychosocial aspects of fatigue.</description>
