      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a Home-based Constraint-Induced
      Movement Therapy (hCIMT) compared to a Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT)
      delivered in a outpatient setting on upper limb motor recovery in stroke survivors.

    <textblock>
      Home-based Constraint Induced Modified Therapy (hCIMT) consist of 2 hours intensive upper
      limb practice with shaping techniques + 2 hours ADLs supervised by a caregiver. Patients are
      supposed to wear a mitt on the unaffected hand for 4 hours daily.

      Modified Constraint Induced Modified Therapy (mCIMT) consist of 2 hours intensive upper limb
      practice with shaping techniques supervised by an experienced physiotherapist + 2 hours ADLs
      at home (supervised by a caregiver) Patients are supposed to wear a mitt on the unaffected
      hand for 4 hours daily.

    <description>This intervention is based on 3 main aspects:
intensive training of functional tasks with the affected arm (massed practice)
constraint of the un-affected hand through a mitt
shaping techniques designed to transfer gains to the real world activities
The 2 hours massed practice will be performed in a outpatient clinic with a supervision of PT.</description>

intensive training of functional tasks with the affected arm (massed practice)
constraint of the un-affected hand through a mitt
shaping techniques designed to transfer gains to the real world activities
In this group, a comprehensive set of the material necessary to perform the training at home and a booklet containing an explanation of the exercises that can be done will be provided to subjects.
In addition, 2 hospital visits will be scheduled to instruct subjects and caregivers on the training and to update activities (1 visit at the beginning + 1 visit after 1 week).</description>
