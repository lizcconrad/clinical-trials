  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) for adults with any type of multiple sclerosis. The secondary objectives are
      to: 1) Explore the ability of MBSR to improve perceived stress and quality of life compared
      to an education control group; and 2) Explore the durability of the effects of MBSR over one
      year.

    <measure>Recruitment: Number of participants enrolled over a ten-month period</measure>
    <time_frame>Recruitment will be tracked monthly with an expected recruitment period of 10 months..</time_frame>
    <description>Feasible recruitment is defined as the ability to recruit and enroll 60 participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) over a ten-month time frame. Recruitment rate will be calculated as the proportion of eligible patients who provided informed consent per month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR): Number of Participants who are present for at least 5 of the classes, including the final class, and complete at least 70% of homework.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be tracked with a sign-in/sign out sheet at each class and with daily homework logs. Attendance will be calculated by a sign in/sign out sheet, being present for at least 75% of a class will count as attended. Homework will be tabulated as both a frequency count (number of days homework was completed) and amount (total number of minutes completed). Participants who are present for at least 5 of the classes, including the final class, and complete at least 70% of homework will be recorded as 'adherent'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption: Qualitative assessment of facilitators of and barriers to participation in the MBSR program.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and week 8 of the 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption is defined as the ability of participants to take part in activities such as yoga poses and meditative exercises. Qualitative outcomes include a brief, semi-structured focus group conducted at the beginning of the MBSR classes during weeks five and eight. Focus groups will address successes and any challenges participants may be experiencing. Focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion: Number of participants with complete follow-up at 12 months post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>A feasible completion rate is defined as complete follow-up in at least 70% of enrolled subjects at 12-months post-intervention. Completion indicates acceptability of a long-term trial and will inform future study designs.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a formalized, experiential, 8-week stress-management program. Participants attend weekly two-hour classes and a half-day retreat during which they learn mindfulness meditation, breath work, yoga postures, self-reflection and awareness.</description>

    <description>The MS Education Control program is matched to MBSR for time and attention yet has no overlap with intervention content. Each two-hour class uses a pamphlet published by the National MS Society to present information about a different MS topic such as Fatigue; Bowel and Bladder Problems; Diet; Spasticity; and Nutritional Supplementation: Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs.</description>
