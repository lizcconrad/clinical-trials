      Effect of intraoperative insufflation of carbon dioxide on the neurologic complications in
      the early postoperative period after open cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial air embolism in cardiac surgery is not a rare complication, leading to neurological
      damage in the early postoperative period of 3-5%. Insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into
      the operative field to prevent cerebral or myocardial damage by air embolism is reported
      since 1967 in open heart surgery (Selman MW et al. 1967).

      Carbon dioxide fills the thoracic cavity by gravity and replaces air if adequately
      insufflated. Because solubility of CO2 is better than that of air, occlusion or flow
      disruption in arteries of the brain or the heart is thought to be diminished. Despite
      carefully performed deairing procedures as puncturing of the ascending aorta and cardiac
      massage, transcranial Doppler studies revealed large amounts of emboli during the first
      ejections of the beating heart (van der Linden J et al. 1991). In patiens with minimally
      invasive approach and redo valve surgery, deairing of the cardiac chambers has become more
      difficult.

      Although the use of carbon dioxide when filling in the surgical field, as the prevention of
      air embolism reduces the number of intracardiac emboli according to transesophageal
      echocardiography there is no evidence of a sustained reduction in cerebrovascular events (G.
      Salvatore al. 2009).

    <description>Procedure: cardiac surgery with opening of heart chambers.
Will be including 167 patients to undergo cardiac surgery. After the main operation phase all heart cavities are sealed, left vent drainage is stopped, ascending aorta is punctured and cardiac massage is performed, ventilation is started and the heart is filled with volume. Operating table is positioned in the Trendelenburg position, and aorta is opened. The amount of air in the cavities is evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography.</description>
