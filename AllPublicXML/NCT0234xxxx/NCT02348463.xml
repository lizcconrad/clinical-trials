    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a known risk factor for preterm delivery. This study was
      conducted in an attempt to investigate if treatment of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy
      could reduce the risk for preterm delivery.

      Women were screened for bacterial vaginosis during the first visits at the maternal health
      care unit with a vaginal sample that were taken by the midwife or by herself. After the
      vaginal samples was air dried it was sent to the gynaecological department and was
      investigated using Hay/Ison classification. Eligible women were those who had lived in
      Skaraborg and delivered at Skaraborg hospital.

      The study has started 2007 and will continue until 2014. Pregnant women that will come to the
      maternal health care units in gestational week 8-11 will be offered to be screened for
      bacterial vaginosis. A vaginal sample will be taken by the midwife or by the women herself.
      The vaginal sample is air-dried and sent to the gynecological. There it is investigated using
      Hay/Ison classification for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

      Women with bacterial vaginosis will be offered treatment with topical clindamycin treatment
      for 7 days if the women has passed the 12th gestational week. A control sample for the test
      of cure will be done after 10 week. If not cured of BV she will be offered a new treatment.

      All women will be followed until delivery.
