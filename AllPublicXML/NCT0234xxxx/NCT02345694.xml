  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised controlled study is to determine the impact of continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus sub-therapeutic CPAP (placebo) on the control of gait
      upon severe sleep apnea patients, based on stride time variability.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As severe sleep apnea patients exhibit gait abnormalities, this is the first randomised
      controlled trial to our knowledge to assess the impact of CPAP upon gait and postural control
      in severe sleep apnea patients. Based on a dual-task paradigm, posture and gait analysis will
      be perform before and after 8 week of intervention.

      Beside gait parameters, the cerebral metabolism will be assessed using a Near Infrared
      Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device during normal walking and during walking while dual-tasking,
      using a visual and a verbal task.

    <measure>Change from baseline of stride time coefficient of variation at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The stride time will be recorded during an overground walking test, under single (walking alone) and dual-task (walking while performing a cognitive task) condition. The cognitive task used in our protocol is an electronic Stroop test, displayed on a screen at the end of the 10 meters walkway. The coefficient of variation allows us to estimate stride time variability, known to be the reflect of gait control efficiency when it exhibits low values.</description>
