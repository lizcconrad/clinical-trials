  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide or
      alternative AA therapy in CRPC participants who were previously treated with a combined
      androgen blockade therapy which included bicalutamide (Bic-CAB). Efficacy and safety of
      enzalutamide and alternative AA therapy will be evaluated, and effective therapy against CRPC
      after treatment with Bic-CAB will be investigated.
