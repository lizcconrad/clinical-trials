  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as a home-based therapy following
      total knee arthroplasty. Measures of interest: lower limb venous hemodynamics, joint range of
      motion, lower limb swelling, walking speed, quality of life, activities of daily living,
      device usability, device compliance, activity levels, and pain (VAS).

      The use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as a home-based therapy following
      total knee arthroplasty. All participants receive and use a research stimulator for
      approximately 5 weeks following total knee arthroplasty. Participants randomised to either a
      stimulation group or placebo-controlled group. Stimulation of the soleus muscle to
      investigate the effects on lower limb venous hemodynamics, joint range of motion, lower limb
      swelling, walking speed, quality of life, activities of daily living, device usability,
      device compliance, activity levels, and pain (VAS) in both groups.
