    <textblock>
      The straight Tenckhoff is the most common catheter for peritoneal dialysis. A new, more
      expensive,self-locating catheter with a heavy tip has been developed by Di Paolo. The
      investigators used these catheters in parallel for several years. To clarify what catheter
      has least problems the investigators performed a comparative study to clarify if outflow
      problems differed between these catheters.

      The straight Tenckhoff catheter (sT) is the most common used catheter for peritoneal dialysis
      (PD). A new, more expensive, self-locating catheter (sLC) has been developed by Di Paolo. The
      investigators had used both in parallel for several years. To clarify what catheter to focus
      on in the future the investigators performed a comparative study to clarify if outflow
      problems differed between these catheters.

      Study design: interventional and randomized at the same hospital Patients: Patients that were
      planned to start PD were informed and asked to participate in the randomized study. All
      patients who were asked accepted and consented to be included in the investigation.

      At the investigators hospital, insertion of pertitnoean dialysis catheters is performed by
      open surgery. This is performed using a three layer suture technique performed in local
      anesthesia. The technique enables immediate start of dialysis after surgery.

      Outflow problems were defined as a delay of flow of more than 40 minutes for 500ml of PD
      fluid.

      The duration of time was calculated by months on PD. Patients who died, were transplanted or
      changed for hemodialysis were censored. End-point was an insufficient drainage/flow of
      dialysis fluid that unabled adequate dialysis and intervention (by surgery) was necessary to
      correct/change catheter.

      Statistical analyses used were Breslow test and Kaplan Meier survival curve.
