      A multicenter, randomized phase III study to compare chemo- versus endocrine therapy in
      combination with dual HER2-targeted therapy of Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and Perjeta®
      (pertuzumab) in patients with HER2 positive and hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Especially for diseases that are not curable such as metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the
      maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are
      well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life.
      Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down
      metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade
      adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the
      combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an
      effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy
      with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations
      derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in
      turn positively affects quality of life.The combination of dual HER2-targeted therapy with
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus endocrine therapy might offer a better treatment option in
      patients with HER2 positive and hormone-receptor positive MBC. However, this combination has
      not been evaluated and compared to the combination of dual HER2-targeted plus chemotherapy in
      a prospective randomized phase III clinical trial.

          -  Previous treatment with pertuzumab

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agents during trial

                  ≥100/min at rest, significant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) or
                  higher-grade AV-block (second degree AV-block Type 2 [Mobitz 2] or third degree
                  AV-block)

               -  angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication

               -  clinically significant valvular heart disease

               -  evidence of transmural infarction on ECG

                  Hg)

               -  any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician would
                  make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient

          -  Dyspnea at rest or other diseases that require continuous oxygen therapy

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or with evidence of clinically significant
