      Trail 11991 is a Phase 1 randomized, open label, single-site trial. Approximately 19
      participants (9 female, 10 male) will be randomized to the 9 female study arms and 4 male
      study arms with 1-3 participants per arm. The randomization will be completed for the product
      sequence and the timing of tissue sample collection.

      All participants will receive both study products by multiple routes of administration (i.e.,
      PO, PR, [and PV for female participants]), and they will be randomized to the order of
      product sequence and specimen sampling schedule. The male participants will receive oral and
      rectal MVC and the female participants will receive oral, rectal, and vaginal MVC, in
      randomized sequence.

      Participant accrual will take approximately 6 months. Male participants will be on study for
      approximately 9 to 12 weeks. Female participants will be on study for approximately 12 to 16
      weeks. The total duration of the study will be approximately 9 months.
