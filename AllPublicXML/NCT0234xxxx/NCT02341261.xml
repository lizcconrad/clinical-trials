    <textblock>
      The proposed study will randomize participants with diabetic peripheral neuropathy into two
      groups. One group of participants will receive standard-of-care counseling while the other
      group will undergo supervised exercise and counseling to increase physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects over 8% of Americans, and half will develop peripheral
      neuropathy, a progressive injury to the very longest nerves of the body. Our previous
      research has found that neuropathy can be detected early in its course and followed by
      examining nerves that reach to the skin using a small punch biopsy. These cutaneous nerves
      can be injured by high blood glucose, obesity and high triglycerides, but have the potential
      to regrow in response to treatments that improve these metabolic conditions. The proposed
      study will randomize participants with mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy to
      receive either generic annual counseling or an integrated program of moderate supervised
      exercise and actigraphy based anti sedentariness counseling.

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention will perform supervised aerobic, resistance and balance training twice weekly for 12 weeks, and weekly thereafter. Actigraphy-based counseling to reduce sedentary behavior will follow a similar taper. Daily text messages, &quot;tweets&quot;, emails, and social media posts at random times during waking hours will be used to provide reminders and motivational messages. Participants will have 11 separate 7-day continuous ActivePAL training session incorporating vibrostimulatory feedback spread across the treatment period.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. T2D defined by ADA criteria.

          2. Peripheral neuropathy based on the Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group consensus
             criteria for &quot;Confirmed diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy&quot;.

          3. Moderate DPN severity with a UENS of 2-18.

          4. Age between 30 and 75.

          5. Under the care of an identified Primary Care Physician (PCP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any alternative cause for peripheral neuropathy. The following tests must have been
             found normal within the last 12 months or will be performed pre-randomization: vitamin
             B12, serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. ANA and TSH may be obtained if
             clinically indicated and not available from clinical records.

          2. Family history of a non-diabetic neuropathy in a first-degree relative.

          3. Severe or longstanding neuropathy: UENS &gt; 18 or history of foot ulceration or
             amputation.

          4. Participants taking Coumadin or oral factor X or thrombin inhibitor therapy will be
             considered on an individual basis by the site investigator.

          5. Severe edema, dermatologic or lower extremity condition that would increase risk of
             skin biopsy.

          6. A serious medical condition that might shorten life span or prevent exercise.

          7. Subjects with obesity or hypertension considered in a dangerous range (BMI&gt; 45,
             systolic BP &gt;170, or diastolic BP &gt;110) and those who fail a medically supervised
             graded maximal stress test will be excluded from the study for safety reasons.

          8. An inability to understand or cooperate with the procedures of the study

          9. Females who are pregnant at screening or actively plan to become pregnant during the
             study period, because of the marked changes in metabolism anticipated during
             pregnancy.

         10. If ,in the investigators assessment, that participation in the study would be limited
             by a person's weight, size, or other physical condition.
