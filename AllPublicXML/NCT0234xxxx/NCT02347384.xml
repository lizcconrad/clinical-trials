      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study in Chinese subjects to compare
      the safety and efficacy of the Delta PLUS Femoral Head and SL-TWIN Stem with BIOLOX forte
      ball head and SL-PLUS Stem in total hip arthroplasty

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the incidence of joint disease continues to increase, an ever growing percentage of the
      affected population will undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA). This recent upward trend for
      THA procedures appears to be directly related to the prevalence of certain health factors.
      Specifically, longer life spans, rising obesity rates, and increasing physical activity
      levels in relatively younger populations are all examples of factors that may significantly
      contribute to hip degeneration. While strategies such as weight reduction, lifestyle change,
      or drug therapy may offer temporary relief from the symptoms of joint degeneration, THA
      remains the standard of care for subjects experiencing significant losses in quality of life
      due to advanced hip disease.

      There has been an increase in imported hip prostheses during the past decade, so that
      surgeons now have more choices of implants. However, the high cost of imported prostheses has
      become a barrier to the development of hip replacement in China and caused many patients
      requiring immediate hip replacement to have to delay or miss their surgery. The development
      and promotion of high-quality domestic joint implants and surgical instruments is the key to
      the development of joint replacement technique in China.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of subjects implanted
      with the Delta PLUS Femoral Head + SL-TWIN Stem compared to a randomized concurrent control
      group of subjects implanted with the BIOLOX forte ball head + SL-PLUS Stem in terms of mean
      Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 1 year.
