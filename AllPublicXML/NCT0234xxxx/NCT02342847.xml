  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, post-authorization, prospective follow-up, multi-centre, national
      study designed to describe the spectrum of health-related quality of life in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer previously untreated with chemotherapy This study is designed to
      observe patients treated in routine clinical practice, without the exclusion limitations of a
      clinical trial. Patients will be enrolled in 7 Spanish sites. In all cases, the decision to
      treat patients will be performed prior to the decision to include the patient in the study.

      Given the observational nature of the study, follow-up of patients will be performed
      according to standard clinical practice of each site.
