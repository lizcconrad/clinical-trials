      The Primary objective of this study is to understand the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population
      in national integrated delivery network who are treated with first- or second-line biologic
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) therapy (with or without Methotrexate) and to
      evaluate switching patterns and reasons for switching to another bDMARD.

        Individual patients with RA will be identified using electronic medical records from
        01/01/2007 to 10/31/2012. The medical file contains data on diagnostic and therapeutic
        services rendered in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The diagnoses and procedures
        for these services are coded using ICD-9-CM, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), and
        Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes with service dates.
