  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis is a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced by an
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated inflammatory response. Treatment may involve pharmacotherapy
      and specific immunotherapy (IT). IT represents the only treatment that might alter the
      natural course of the disease. The amount of administered allergen is crucial for both
      efficacy and safety of specific IT. SUBLIVAC FIX Mite mixture is a preparation for sublingual
      IT (SLIT) and is indicated for the treatment of allergic disorders such as allergic rhinitis
      and rhinoconjunctivitis, caused by sensitisation to house dust mite (HDM) allergens.

      According to the European Medicines Agency Guideline on the clinical development of products
      for specific IT for the treatment of allergic diseases, products should be tested at
      different dosages to provide preliminary data on safety and tolerability with regard to the
      maximum tolerated dose and suitable dose escalation scheme. This trial is designed to
      investigate the tolerability and safety of different dosages of SUBLIVAC FIX Mite mixture.
