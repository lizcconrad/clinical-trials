  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective studies indicate that active surveillance for clinically localized, small renal
      masses (cT1a, &lt;=4cm) is safe. It is our hypothesis that active surveillance is safe and
      efficacious when compared prospectively to patients undergoing immediate intervention for
      their small renal mass.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients are offered active surveillance or immediate intervention, as applicable, prior
      to being offered consent for the DISSRM Registry. All patients are enrolled and followed
      prospectively. Surveillance patients are followed per protocol with serial imaging, blood
      work and quality of life questionnaires. Intervention patients are followed at the discretion
      of the attending surgeon with serial QOL appointments/questionnaires.
