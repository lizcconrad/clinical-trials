  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a Medication Event Monitoring
      System (MEMS®) cap with a liquid crystal display (LCD) reader (a &quot;smart&quot; cap) along with
      additional patient counseling intervention (Arm 3) can improve adherence to dimethyl fumarate
      (DMF) treatment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as compared to a MEMS cap without an LCD
      reader (a &quot;standard&quot; cap) and no patient counseling intervention (standard of care, Arm 1) at
      Month 12.

      The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are: to determine if data
      display on a smart MEMS cap with an LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence as compared to a
      standard MEMS cap without an LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 12; to determine whether the
      addition of patient counseling intervention based on MEMS data (Arm 3), or data display from
      a MEMS cap with an LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence compared to standard MEMS cap
      without an LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 6; to assess persistence and compliance at Months 6
      and 12 for all arms; to assess the association between adherence and patient- reported
      outcomes (PROs) for all arms including Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI): MS v2.0.

    <description>The 29-item MSIS-29 is a participant-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a participants perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>

    <description>The WPAI questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
