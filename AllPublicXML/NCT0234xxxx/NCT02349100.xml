      To determine FDG uptake following uncomplicated EVAR using the Nellix endoprosthesis. Does
      uncomplicated EVAR using the nellix endoprosthesis result in increased FDG uptake and false
      positive PET imaging?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most devastating complications following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is
      infection of the used endoprosthesis. Because of the high mortality of secondary surgery
      following infection, patients with a possible endoprosthesis infection are treated using
      broadspectrum antibiotics during months, years or even life-long. Unfortunately, the
      diagnosis of an endoprosthesis infection is difficult and based upon clinical suspicion and
      non-specific symptoms (e.g. fever and weigth loss) only. Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission
      Tomography (FDG-PET) is often used as a diagnostic tool to identify infection following EVAR.
      Like infection, sterile physiologic inflammation following EVAR is also associated with
      increased metabolism and FDG uptake. This could result in (false-)positive PET imaging
      resulting in diagnostic errors and antibiotic overuse.

      The Nellix endoprosthesis is a relatively new device used for EVAR. In present literature
      there is no data on the degree of physiologic inflammation following implantation of a Nellix
      device and the value of postoperative FDG-PET imaging to detect infection is not known. This
      makes the diagnosis of infection following Nellix implantation extremely difficult. This
      pilot is designed to determine physiologic FDG uptake following uncomplicated EVAR using the
      Nellix endoprosthesis.
