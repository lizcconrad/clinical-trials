  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is the leading attributable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      In rural South Asia, hypertension remains to be a significant public health issue with
      sub-optimal rates of case finding and management. A trial to investigate integrated primary
      care strategies to control hypertension is planned. Packaged interventions for the planned
      full-scale study are varying combinations of 1) home health education (HHE) by trained
      community health workers (CHW), 2) trained government primary health centre mid-level
      providers (MLP) led care and 3) trained private practitioners. The goal of the full-scale
      study is to test which combination of the above interventions is the most effective in
      lowering blood pressure among adults with hypertension in rural communities. In addition, the
      full-scale study aims to quantify the incremental cost- effectiveness of each approach in
      terms of cost per projected cardiovascular disease (CVD) disability adjusted life-years
      (DALYs) averted.

      The rationale for conducting the feasibility study in 3 proposed South Asian countries is
      strong. The South Asian countries are in a unique stage of epidemiological transition with a
      double burden of communicable and NCDs, the latter increasing rapidly. (2) These countries
      also share cultural habits and social structure with an extended family system, and have
      largely similar population characteristics and health seeking behaviours. (10)Moreover, the
      rural health system in all South Asian countries relies on cadres community health workers.
      At the same time there are some differences. Bangladesh and Pakistan have a high proportion
      of people living in extreme poverty (purchasing power parity &lt;US $1.25/day, 49.6% and 22.6%,
      respectively) compared to Sri Lanka (14%) which has relatively better development indicators
      in terms of life expectancy and literacy rates (World Bank 2010). However age-standardized
      death rates from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are uniformly high in all 3 countries. The
      feasibility will allow direct comparison of some of these population (individual) and health
      systems characteristics among countries relevant for hypertension care. Thus, data from the
      feasibility will inform the future design of the trial.

      In order to optimize the trial design of the full study, a mixed-methods feasibility study
      with quasi-experimental pre- and post- evaluation of &quot;triple approach&quot; with all 3 components
      of intervention, survey of pharmacies, and focus group discussions and individual in-depth
      interviews to better inform the strategies for the full-scale trial in rural settings in
      Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
