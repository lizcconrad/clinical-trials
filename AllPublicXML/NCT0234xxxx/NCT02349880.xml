      &quot;Shared decision-making&quot; is being promoted as a promising approach for engaging patients with
      schizophrenia in medical decisions and improving satisfaction and adherence.

      To implement shared decision-making, both physicians and patients should commit to it and
      engage in a mutual decision process. Most research, however, has addressed interventions that
      either focus on the doctors' side (e.g. &quot;communication skills&quot;) or on informing patients
      about treatment options (e.g. &quot;decision aids&quot;). These approaches have been shown to be
      feasible in clinical practice but had no strong effects on treatment patterns or adherence,
      possibly because they were insufficient to motivate and enable patients to engage actively in
      decision-making. Moreover, these interventions still rely on the doctor's willingness to
      share decisions, which has been shown to vary considerably.

      To overcome these limitations and since many patients do not feel competent to participate in
      decision-making we developed an intervention that focuses on patients' communicative
      competencies. this intervention, a five session group-training, will be implemented for
      inpatients suffering from schizophrenia.
