  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether nasal high frequency oscillation ventilation (nHFOV) immediately after
      extubation reduces the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (paCO2) at 72 hours after
      extubation in comparison with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in very low
      birth weight infants (VLBWs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled clinical trial comparing nHFOV vs nCPAP immediately after extubation of
      VLBW infants.

      Intervention and treatment protocol as described for the two study arms.

      Definition of treatment failure (infant meets at least one criterion):

        -  Sustained pCO2 &gt;80 mmHg and pH &lt;7.20 confirmed by arterial or capillary blood gas
           analysis in spite of optimized non-invasive respiratory support with maximum settings as
           defined above.

        -  Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &gt;0.6 to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation as
           measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) at 90-94% in spite of optimized non-invasive
           respiratory support with maximum settings as defined above.

        -  Reintubation (study patients may be intubated at any time, due to clinical
           considerations, with or without reaching another criterion of &quot;treatment failure&quot;).

      Sample size:

      Assuming a variability of the paCO2 as previously reported for difficult-to-wean preterm
      infants in our unit (Czernik C, J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med 2012) and a treatment failure
      rate of 22% within 72 hours after extubation, we calculated a sample size of 34 patients in
      each study arm to detect a difference in the paCO2 of 7 mmHg, using a two-sided significance
      of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.

      Randomization:

      Sequence generation by an independent statistician and a study nurse. Block randomization
      using at least two different block sizes. Allocation concealment using sequentially numbered
      opaque sealed envelopes.

      Data monitoring:

      By an independent statistician.
