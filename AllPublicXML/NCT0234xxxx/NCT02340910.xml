    <textblock>
      This study will enroll people with SCI who have spasticity and some ability to walk. The goal
      is to understand if standing on a platform and receiving WBV results in decreased spasticity
      and improved walking ability.

      Phase 1 of this study has been successfully completed. The results of Phase 1 indicate that a
      single session of WBV lasting for a total of 6 minutes (delivered in eight 45-sec bouts) at a
      high-frequency (50Hz) was associated with the largest decrease in spasticity (as measured by
      the pendulum test).

      The goal for Phase 2 is to determine whether longer doses of WBV result in greater reductions
      in spasticity as well as improvements in walking ability. Two different doses of WBV, a short
      dose and a long dose, will be tested.

          -  have spinal cord injury of at least 6 months duration.

          -  be between the ages of 16 - 70 years old.

          -  be able to stand for at least one minute using the upper extremities for balance only.

          -  be able to move one leg at least a small amount using whatever devices are most
             helpful for you.

          -  have at least mild spasticity affecting the lower extremity muscles.

          -  be able to transfer from sit to stand requiring no more than moderate assistance of
             one person.

          -  be able to understand and provide own consent

          -  You may participate if you use prescription medications, including baclofen pump for
             control of spasticity, as the dosage is stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  progressive or potentially progressive spinal lesions, including degenerative, or
             progressive vascular disorders of the spine and/or spinal cord.

          -  history of cardiovascular irregularities

          -  problems following instructions

          -  orthopedic problems that would limit your participation in the protocol (e.g. knee or
