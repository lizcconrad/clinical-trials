      Phase II Study of Refametinib, a MEK inhibitor, as second-line treatment in advanced biliary
      tract adenocarcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refametinib will be administered orally at the starting dose of 50 mg twice daily on a
      continuous daily dosing schedule.

      Self-administration of refametinib tablets will take place on an outpatient basis. Patients
      experiencing dose-limiting toxicity attributed to study medication should have at least
      1-week treatment breaks inserted into the continuous daily dosing period as needed and/or may
      be interrupted or reduced depending on individual tolerability.
