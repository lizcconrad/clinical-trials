             4 in the 5-stage Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) symmetrically

          3. Those who were informed on the purpose, method, and effect etc. of this study and
             signed the informed consent form

         16. Those who refused to agree not to use a local or systemic pain-relieving agent or
             other pain-relieving method (e.g.: ice pack) from the midnight of the treatment day
