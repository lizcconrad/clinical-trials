      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a Transdiagnostic Internet-based Protocol
      (Emotion Regulation Protocol) for the treatment of unipolar mood disorders (major depression
      and dysthimia) four anxiety disorders (Panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety
      disorder and social anxiety disorder) and obsessive-compulsive disorder in comparison with
      Treatment as Usual in specialized care (Spanish public mental health system).

      Emotional disorders (ED) (anxiety and mood disorders) are among the most prevalent mental
      disorders, with a life prevalence of 29% and comorbidity rates that range between 40 and 80%.
      If they are not adequately treated the course is often chronic, and them significantly affect
      important functioning areas such as work and social relationships. Thus, these data strongly
      suggest efficacious and efficient treatments are needed in order to address this important
      health problem. The classification and differentiation of mental disorders carried out in
      manuals like the DSM and the ICD has played an important role in the emphasis placed on the
      research about the treatment of specific disorders; however, it has also been a problem in
      the dissemination of evidenced-based treatments due to the difficulties in training the
      clinicians in the variety of the available disorder-specific programs. In fact, less than 50%
      of people suffering from emotional disorders receive a psychological treatment; and this is
      also accounted for by its costs and time of application. As a consequence, many people decide
      not to search for psychological treatment. In addition, epidemiological studies have shown
      that at least 55% of people suffering from an anxiety disorder suffer from another anxiety
      disorder at the moment of the assessment, and this prevalence rate is up to 76% when
      different lifespan diagnoses are taken into account. This high comorbidity rate indicates
      that the different ED share important characteristics and it has been proposed that this
      overlapping is accounted for by common biological and psychological vulnerabilities that
      along with psychosocial stress factors leads to different manifestations of the same
      vulnerability, i. e., the different mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, a Transdiagnostic
      approach could help overcome these barriers.

      Transdiagnostic approaches have implications in the treatment of psychological disorders as a
      number of treatment protocols have been developed based on this perspective. Clark has
      distinguished three perspectives in transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy: a) The
      transdiagnostic practice, a pragmatic perspective that includes components of various
      disorder-specific intervention protocols whose aim is to determine which are the active
      components in samples with those disorders. The contributions of Norton, Andrews and Titov,
      and the study: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) belong to this category. b)
      The transdiagnostic theory, that specifies a theoretical framework which outlines the common
      psychological constructs that influence the maintenance of ED. For instance, the tripartite
      model of anxiety and depression, with positive and negative affect as relevant constructs. c)
      The Unified Protocol. The Barlow's team has designed a protocol, adequate for the treatment
      of ED which focuses on four essential aspects: to increase present-focused emotional
      awareness, to identify and modify emotional avoidance patterns, to promote the cognitive
      flexibility and to facilitate exposure to avoided situations and sensations.

      Another aspect that could enhance the dissemination of evidence-based treatments as well as
      considerably reduce the costs is the use of the Internet. A number of sistematic reviews has
      shown that Internet-based treatments yield similar results when compared to face-to-face
      therapy. Nevertheless, most of these programs are focused on a single disorder since a few
      Transdiagostic Internet-based treatments have been developed and tested by means of
      randomized controlled trials so far. Furthermore, no studies on efficacy of Internet-based
      Transdiagnostic vs Treatment as usual (TAU) have been carried out in specialized care.
      Therefore, we have developed a Transdiagnostic Internet-based protocol treatment (Emotion
      Regulation Protocol) based on the Unified Protocol proposed by Barlow, that also includes
      components of emotion regulation and acceptance.

      The aim of this study will be to test the efficacy of a Transdiagnostic Internet-based
      protocol (Emotion Regulation Protocol) for the treatment of emotional disorders by means of a
      randomized controlled trial in a sample made up of participants from specialized care of the
      Spanish public mental health system. The study will include two conditions: a)
      Transdiagnostic Internet-based treatment protocol and b) TAU. The main hypothesis is that the
      Transdiagnostic protocol will be more efficacious than TAU and that will obtain a good
      acceptance by patients and mental health professionals. We also expect the online
      Transdiagnostic protocol to be more efficient when compared with TAU (e. g., a significant
      greater number of patients which receive a psychological treatment, a significant reduction
      of the waiting lists and costs such as hours of clinical assistance and hours of face-to-face
      treatment, etc.).

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used questionnaires to evaluate the severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. It consists of 21 items about the different symptoms characterizing the major depression disorder, summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and a test-retest reliability of around 0.8.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck, &amp; Steer, 1990) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure designed to assess anxiety. Each item has a 4-point Severity scale (e.g., not at all, mildly, moderately, and severely) that addresses symptoms experienced during the past week. The internal consistency of the BAI has been found to range from .85 to .94 and has been found to have adequate convergent and divergent validity.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI-R) (Foa et al., 2002) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OCI-R is a scale made up of 18 items rated 1 to 4 and organized in 6 dimensions (washing, verification, order, obsession, hoarding and mental neutralization) that assesses obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The OCI-R has a good internal consistency (coefficient alpha between .81 and .93), a good to excellent test-retest reliability (between .57 and .91), a good convergent validity and a solid factor structure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Self-Reported Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS-SR) (Houck, Spiegel, Shear, &amp; Rucci, 2002) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures the severity of the panic disorder through measures of panic attack frequency, distress during the panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, fear and agoraphobic avoidance, fear and avoidance of physical sensations, and work and social impairment. The reliability of the scale has proved to be excellent (coefficient alpha of .917) as also has done the test-retest reliability (ICC = .81).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Pen State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) (Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire that evaluates the worry as an incontrollable, generalized and excessive experience. The psychometric properties of the PSWQ have proved to be good, with an internal consistency ranging from .91 to .95, and a good validity and test-retest reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Social Interaction Anxiety Inventory (SIAS) (Mattick y Clarke, 1998) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is made up of twenty items rated 0 to 4 that asses the anxiety experienced by the patient in social interactive situations. The scale has a good internal consistency (alpha coefficient between .88 and .94), good test-retest and discriminant reliability, as well as appropriate construct validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the EuroQoL-5D (Bad√≠a, 1999) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Generic instrument of health-related quality of life. It consists of two parts: Part 1 assesses self-reported problems in each of five domains: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain is divided into three levels of severity corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems Part 2 records the subject's self-assessed health on a VAS, a 10 cm vertical line on which the best and worst imaginable health states score 100 and 0, respectively.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) (V√°zquez-Barquero et al., 1997) at pre, at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CSRI is an interview that allows the clinician to collect quantitative and qualitative information about the use of health and social services, as well as information about the economic impact of the disease (e. g., time off sick from work due to the disease). The CSRI takes about 20 minutes to be administered and includes multiple choice items as well as open questions. The version utilized in this study was designed to assess the use of services in the previous twelve months.</description>
