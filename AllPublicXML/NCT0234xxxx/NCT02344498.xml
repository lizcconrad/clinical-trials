  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral hepatitis kills nearly one million people each year, even though effective treatment
      exists. The aim of this study is to establish a treatment protocol for hepatitis B, which is
      simple and cheap enough to be implemented in resource-limited settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic viral hepatitis is a major health problem globally. Each year nearly one million
      deaths are attributable to either hepatitis B or C. In Ethiopia 5-10% of the general
      population are infected with hepatitis B. Oral antiviral treatment of hepatitis B exists, but
      high costs and advanced laboratory requirements have been barriers to offer such treatment in
      resource-limited settings, resembling the situation in treatment of HIV/AIDS a decade ago.

      The present study will investigate a simplified approach to hepatitis B treatment in
      resource-limited settings, inspired by the recent success of HIV treatment in such settings.
      The critical research question is how to identify patients with expected benefit of treatment
      in the absence of advanced laboratory support. A WHO expert panel recently suggested
      treatment criteria for use in settings without advanced laboratory facilities, but these
      criteria have not yet been tested out in real life. The present study will build on and
      develop the WHO approach to treatment of hepatitis B, aiming to develop a treatment protocol
      that can be feasible in other resource-limited countries. The potential public health benefit
      for poor people in low- and middle-income countries is substantial.
