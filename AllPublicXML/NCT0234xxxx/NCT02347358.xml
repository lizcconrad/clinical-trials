  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test a hypothesis that temporary implantation of JRecanTM blood flow
      recanalisation device within 6.5 hours of symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke due to a
      major intracranial artery occlusion following IV r-tPA can provide a greater rate of early
      successful recanalisation than treatment of IV r-tPA alone.

          3. NIHSS ≥ 8 and &lt; 30 at the time of randomization

          4. Initiation of the correct IV t-PA dose treatment within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke
             symptoms (onset time is defined as the last time when the patient was witnessed to be
             at baseline)

          5. Complement of catheter angiography within 6.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms

          6. Thrombolysis in myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0-1 flow in the intracranial internal
             carotid artery, M1 segment of the MCA, basilar artery, or intracranial vertebral
             artery with contralaterally chronic intracranial vertebral artery occlusion confirmed
             by catheter angiography

          7. The acute occlusion lesion is accessible to the JRecanTM blood flow recanalisation
             device

          8. Functional independence before this time stroke (Modified Rankin Score ≤ 1)

          9. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative has signed and dated an
