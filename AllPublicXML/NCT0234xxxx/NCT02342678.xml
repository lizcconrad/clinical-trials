  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LILA study is a pilot randomized parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy
      program versus physical conditionin control program for treatment of urinary incontinence in
      ambulatory middle-aged and older women. Women aged 50 years and older who meet the criteria
      for frequency of incontinence episodes, are not using other clinical treatments for
      incontinence, and meet minimum physical mobility requirements and other eligibility criteria
      will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area.

             screening 3-day voiding diary

          -  Self-report urgency-predominant (i.e., at least half of incontinence episodes being
             urgency-type), stress-predominant (i.e., at least half of episodes being stress-type),
             or mixed-type (i.e., an equal number of stress- and urgency-type episodes)
             incontinence on the screening voiding diary

          -  Willing to refrain from initiating medical treatments that may affect their
             incontinence or voiding pattern during the study intervention period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in formal or organized yoga classes or instruction within the past 3
             months; or any prior yoga therapy directed specifically at improving urinary

          -  Participation in at least weekly organized physical conditioning classes or
             instruction in the past 3 months involving muscle stretching and strengthening
             exercises (not including aerobic classes that do not emphasize stretching or
             strengthening).

          -  Currently pregnant (by self-report or screening urine pregnancy test), gave birth

          -  Current urinary tract infection (screening dipstick urinalysis with leukocyte estrace,
             nitrites or blood) or a history or 3 or more urinary tract infections in the preceding
             year

          -  Report history of neurologic conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal

             urethral dilation), pelvic cancer, or pelvic irradiation for any reason

          -  Report use of bladder botox, electrostimulation, bladder training, or pelvic floor
             exercise training (with certified practitioners) in the past 3 months

          -  Report other surgery to the pelvis (hysterectomy, oophorectomy, vaginal surgery,
             bladder surgery, colon surgery) within the past 3 months

          -  Report use of medications with the potential to affect incontinence (anticholinergic
             bladder medications, tricyclic antidepressants, selective norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitors, mirabegron, loop diuretics) within the past month

          -  Report starting stopping, or changing the dose of a medication with the potential to

             vagina causing a feeling of bulging, pressure, or protrusion or a sensation like your
             &quot;insides are coming out&quot;?&quot;)

             abuse, significant psychiatric problems, or dementia

          -  Participation in another research study that involves investigational drugs or devices
