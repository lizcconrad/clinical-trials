    <textblock>
      The study will aim to compare the effects of a beverage powder fortified with multiple
      micronutrients and Bacopa monnieri extract (test product) to a non-fortified isocaloric
      beverage powder (control product) on cognitive outcomes of attention and working memory.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in regional brain hemodynamic response during attention, as measured by cognitive Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive fMRI will be conducted at baseline and week 17 to assess the changes in regional brain hemodynamic response during attention task. Participants will be scanned while performing Sustained Attention to a Response Test (SART). During SART, a single digit (1-9) will be presented for 1 second(s). For first 333 miliseconds (ms), digit will be displayed in black font, then gray font for remaining 1s. Participants will be instructed to press a button when each digit turns gray. SART will have hard and easy block. During 'hard' block participants will be instructed to press the button for every digit except '3'. Whereas, during 'easy' block, they will be told that no 3's will be presented and no response needs to be withheld. Four easy blocks will be alternated with four hard blocks, with 15s rest between each. fMRI data will be acquired during the task and estimated by convolving hemodynamic response with task related brain Region of Interest</description>

    <measure>Changes in regional brain hemodynamic response during working memory, as measured by cognitive fMRI</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive fMRI will be conducted at baseline and week 17 to assess the changes regional brain hemodynamic response during working memory. The Participants will be scanned while performing n-back working memory task. They will be presented single digit number (0-9) one-by-one on the screen and will respond to targets and non-targets. Targets will be numbers that match those that occurred on the previous trial (1-back condition), the one before that (2-back condition) or the trial before that (3-back). A control condition will be responding to the target number ('0'). Each condition will be repeated thrice and the total task length will be about eight minutes. fMRI data will be acquired during the task and estimated by convolving hemodynamic response with task related brain ROI</description>

    <measure>Correlation between performance scores on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) attention tasks and performance scores on the fMRI attention tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid visual information processing test from CANTAB will be performed to assess sustained attention at baseline and week 17. The screen will display a box which randomly flashes the numbers 2-9. The participants will press the button on the screen when they see a target sequence of 3-5-7. The test will take approximately 7 min. Mean response data will be extracted and partial correlations accounting for agreed covariates will relate task performance on the CANTAB to the corresponding fMRI task response to assess brain-behavioral relationships</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between performance scores on the CANTAB working memory tasks and performance scores on the fMRI working memory tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>Spatial working memory test from CANTAB will be performed to assess working memory at baseline and week 17. The participants will search through a series of boxes until they find a blue chip. They will then move this blue chip to the &quot;home&quot; area on the right hand side of the screen. They will be told to look for the next blue chip which will not be in the same box as before. The number of boxes will be gradually increased from three to eight. Mean response data will be extracted and partial correlations accounting for agreed covariates will relate task performance on the CANTAB to the corresponding fMRI task response to assess brain-behavioral relationships</description>
