  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of the cell
      culture-derived influenza vaccine compared with the egg-derived influenza vaccine among
      subjects.

      To describe the immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination
      inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained pre-vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination.

      To describe the safety, the time of onset and duration of local and systemic solicited
      adverse events are assessed and reported. Unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse
      events are collected and categorized throughout the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study in healthy adult and elderly subjects.
      Subjects receive a single dose of one of the influenza vaccine formulations and provide blood
      samples for immunogenicity assessment.
