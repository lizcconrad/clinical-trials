  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single blinded, randomized, controlled open label non-inferiority phase
      III, trial with two parallel groups, conducted in Ghana and Papua New Guinea (PNG). The
      ultimate goal is to establish if a 20mg/kg dose of azithromycin is as effective as a 30mg/kg
      dose in the treatment of yaws. Approximately 600 clinically and serologically diagnosed yaws
      patients will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment with
      the two antibiotic regimens as follow: (i) Regimen I (AZT20): Single oral dose of 20 mg/kg
      azithromycin (ii) Regimen II (AZT30): Single oral dose of 30 mg/kg azithromycin. The
      follow-up period of patients will be 6 months. Assessments before, during and after the
      antibiotic treatment will include full medical history, clinical assessment of the lesion
      and, laboratory investigations. The primary efficacy parameters are healing of the lesion at
      4 weeks and a four-fold decline in RPR titre at 6 months after start of treatment.
