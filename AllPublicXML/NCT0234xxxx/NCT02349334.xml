    <textblock>
      Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes faeces (stools) without the usual control. It
      is a distressing condition that is actually very common although under-reported because of
      embarrassment. Milder symptoms may be managed by treatments such as dietary change, drugs and
      bowel retraining, but many patients still resort to surgery to improve symptoms. Although
      several operations exist to treat incontinence e.g. those aiming to repair damaged anal
      sphincter muscles, it is now clear that these often have poor results.

      Two relatively new treatments called sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) and percutaneous tibial
      nerve stimulation (PTNS) involve sending pulses of electricity to the nerves controlling the
      bowel and muscles of the anus (anal sphincter).

      SNS does this by inserting electrodes in the lower back just above the tailbone and
      connecting them to an implanted electrical stimulator which is buried in the buttock and acts
      a bit like a heart pacemaker. SNS is a relatively well-established treatment in specialist
      centres, which has been used for over 10 years. It has been shown in studies to be successful
      for faecal incontinence achieving some improvement in at least three quarters of patients. In
      Europe, this procedure is fast becoming first treatment offered when non-surgical treatments
      fail. Nevertheless, SNS is not a miracle cure for all, requiring 2 operations, with potential
      complications and expensive equipment (&gt; £10,000 approx).

      PTNS is a newer treatment, which involves electrically stimulating a nerve at the ankle,
      using a very small needle, as an outpatient (a bit like acupuncture). This sends signals back
      to the spine region to try and improve symptoms of faecal incontinence. Since this is a newer
      treatment, fewer studies have been performed to quantify how successful it is, but early
      results of PTNS suggest that it may be as good as SNS. If this is true, this is very
      important because it is much less invasive and considerably cheaper than SNS (equipment £500
      per patient).

      This project will for the first time determine how effective PTNS is in the treatment of
      patients with faecal incontinence, by comparing it to sham (fake stimulation). This study is
      a properly designed clinical trial of 212 patients in at least 14 UK Specialist Centres.. The
      results of this trial will lead to direct benefits for patients and the NHS.
