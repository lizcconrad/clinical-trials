  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Physical restraints as bedrails and belts are still regularly applied in German
      nursing homes despite clear evidence showing their lack of effectiveness and safety. In a
      cluster-randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of a guideline-based multicomponent
      intervention has been shown with a significant reduction in physical restraints use without
      adverse events. The present study aims to apply different versions of the original
      intervention in nursing home residents in four different regions throughout Germany in order
      to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.

      Methods/Design: Pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing two intervention
      groups ((1) updated original programme and (2) brief version of the updated programme) with a
      control group (3) receiving printed study materials (optimized usual care). Intervention (1)
      consists of an information programme for all nurses, additional training and structured
      support for nominated key nurses, and provision of printed study material and other
      supportive material. For intervention (2) nurses' training is only optional carried out
      facultatively by key nurses who have received an additional train-the-trainer module. The
      control group (3) receives printed study material only. Overall, 120 nursing homes including
      approximately 10800 residents will be recruited, randomized to one of the three groups and
      followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome is defined as proportion of residents with at
      least one physical restraint at 12 months. Physical restraint use will be assessed by direct
      observation. Secondary outcomes are residents` quality of life as well as safety parameters
      as i.g. falls and fall-related fractures. Process and cost measures will also be assessed.
