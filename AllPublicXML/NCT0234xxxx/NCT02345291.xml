      A multicenter, Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo (vehicle)-controlled,
      parallel-group, dose-finding study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of NRD135S.E1 in adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 with neuropathic pain.
      Potential study patients will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related
      procedure.

      Following screening, eligible patients will be enrolled and go through a week of washout of
      analgesic treatment. Patients who are still eligible following the washout will be randomized
      to one of four treatment groups: NRD135S.E1 at 10, 40, or 150 mg per day or placebo
      (vehicle).

      All four treatment groups will start study treatment with 1 week of single blind placebo
      (baseline week) followed by 3 weeks of the allocated double blind treatment (Weeks 1, 2, and
      3). All patients will be followed for 30 days after the last study drug administration. The
      total study duration per patient is 9 to10 weeks.

      Visit schedule: Screening (Days minus 14 to minus 8, Visit 1). Washout visit (Day minus 7,
      Visit 2). Randomization and start of placebo treatment (Day 1, Visit 3). Double blind
      treatment visits on Days 8 (Visit 4), 15 (Visit 5) and 29 (Visit 6). Follow up visit by
      telephone (Day 59, Visit 7).
