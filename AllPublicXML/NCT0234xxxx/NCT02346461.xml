      Background:

      - People with GNE myopathy have muscle weakness and can have difficulty walking . The disease
      comes from a gene mutation related to the production of a sugar called sialic acid.
      Researchers think decreased sialic acid may cause the muscle problems. Researchers are
      testing the drug ManNAc which is a building block of sialic acid. It is a powder that is
      dissolved in water.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate the safety of 90 days of ManNAc given by mouth.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults ages 18 60 diagnosed with GNE myopathy.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first visit
           and will stay 10 14 days. Participants will have:

        -  Medical history and physical exam

        -  Electrocardiogram to measure heart function

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Muscle strength tests

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) muscle scans. Participants will lie on a table that
           slides in and out of a metal tube that takes pictures

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Muscle biopsies. Samples of muscle will be taken, one each from the arm and leg.

        -  The study drug as a liquid twice a day

        -  Participants may wear a small activity monitor throughout the study. It can be worn on a
           waistband.

        -  After discharge from the initial visit, participants will take the study drug at home.
           Participants will need to record if they miss any doses.

        -  Visit 2 will be at 6 weeks for 1 2 days of medical evaluation. Blood samples will be
           drawn.

        -  Visit 3 will be at the end of the study. Participants will stay in the NIH Clinical
           Center for 5 6 days for medical evaluations, muscle tests, and scans. Another muscle
           biopsy will be taken. Blood samples will be drawn.

        -  Participants will be contacted by telephone or email about 4 times after leaving the
           clinic.

      GNE myopathy, previously known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is a rare,
      autosomal recessive myopathy with onset in early adulthood that is characterized by
      progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, which leads to wheelchair use and dependent care.
      The causative gene, GNE, encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of sialic acid.
      While the exact pathophysiology of GNE myopathy remains unknown, decreased sialic acid
      production and subsequent hyposialylation of muscle glycoproteins are thought to be key
      factors leading to muscle deterioration in GNE myopathy. This hypothesis is supported by
      prevention of disease after administration of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) in mouse models
      of GNE myopathy. A recent first-in-human, Phase 1 single ascending dose study evaluated the
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of 3,000, 6,000, or 10,000 mg
      drug product-grade ManNAc in subjects with GNE myopathy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01634750; IND
      No.78,091). ManNAc was safe and well-tolerated in all subjects who participated in this
      study. In this Phase 2, open-label, single-center study we propose to administer ManNAc
      orally to 12 subjects for 912 days (30 months). The objectives of the study are to assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biochemical efficacy of orally
      administered ManNAc in GNE myopathy subjects and to evaluate disease-related biomarkers and
      relevant clinical endpoints. In the first phase of pharmacokinetic assessment, two cohorts of
      6 subjects will receive ManNAc at doses of 3,000 mg twice a day (6,000 mg per day) or 6,000
      mg twice a day (12,000 mg per day) for 7 days while admitted to the NIH Clinical Center to
      assess PK and safety. Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an individual basis. In the
      second phase of the study, all subjects will receive treatment with ManNAc at a dose of 6,000
      mg twice daily for the remainder of the study. Follow-up safety and efficacy evaluations will
      occur at 42 days, and at 91 (3 months), 182 (6 months), 365 (12 months), 548 (18 months), 730
      (24 months) and 912 (30 months) days. Safety lab evaluation will be performed also at 456 (15
      months), 638 (21 months) and 820 (27 months) days either at the NIH clinical center or
      subjects home laboratory or physician s office. Final dosing will occur at the 30-month
      visit. After the final dose, all Grade (Bullet)2 AEs at least possibly related to study drug
      will be followed to resolution. Safety will be evaluated by adverse events (AEs), clinical
      laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations. PK will be assessed for plasma
      ManNAc and Neu5Ac. Biochemical efficacy will be measured by change in the sialylation of
      proteins and clinical efficacy will be assessed using a battery of clinical assessments
      deemed to be relevant based on disease natural history.
