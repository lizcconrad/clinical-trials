  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed for the purpose of estimating various parameters surrounding
      the efficacy of Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide in eliminating minimal residual
      disease (MRD) in acute leukemia patients otherwise in remission and without causing
      significant delay of HCT due to treatment related toxicity.

      A single course of &quot;bridge&quot; chemotherapy is given prior to the transplant procedure as an
      approach to improved disease-free survival in a patient group who historically has had
      inferior outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background.

      The intent of this study design is for all patients to receive and complete one course of
      therapy. Patients who exhibit signs of disease progression or experience an unacceptable
      toxicity will be discontinued from treatment.

      There will be no dose delays or dose reductions of study drugs for hematologic toxicity
      during Consolidation &quot;Bridging&quot; therapy (Day 1 through Day 30); however, prolonged
      hematopoietic recovery or bone marrow aplasia during the first 42 days may meet a study
      stopping rule.

    <description>A bone marrow evaluation to determine study response and remission status will be performed on study Day 30 or upon adequate blood count recovery (ANC &gt; 0.50 and platelet &gt; 50,000), whichever occurs first. If the marrow is hypocellular and without evidence of normal tri-lineage hematopoiesis the marrow should be repeated at Day 42.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with &lt;
             5% blasts in the bone marrow (M1) by morphology and that meets one of the following
             criteria:

        Flow cytometric evidence of MRD (≥ 0.01% leukemic blasts for ALL or ≥ 0.5% leukemic blasts
        for AML detected in the bone marrow) OR Molecular/cytogenetic evidence of disease (FISH or
        PCR methodology) performed within 7 days And with the intent of going on to an allogeneic
        hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) independent of this study
