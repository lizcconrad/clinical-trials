  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human clinical trial to measure the effect of long duration therapeutic ultrasound on tendon
      injuries. The hypothesis is that use of long duration ultrasound will relieve pain, increase
      tendon strength, and improve quality of life for patients with tendon injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability of long duration therapeutic ultrasound to reduce pain, increase strength, and
      improve quality of life for patients with tendon injury [e.g. tendinopathy of the elbow
      (medial or lateral], Achilles tendon, or patellar tendon) will be assessed. During the 7-week
      protocol, participants will receive 4 continuous hours of therapy daily.

      For the first week, baseline data will be collected as participants report pain scores (VAS)
      in the morning, noon, and night. During the next 6 weeks, participants will self-apply the
      device each day and record their pain score (VAS) before and treatment; and record their pain
      score (VAS) while performing specified movements designed to evaluate tendon rehabilitation.
      At bi-weekly site visits, strength measurements will be performed on the injured and
      uninjured limb. Participants will also complete a standardized questionnaire to assess
      disability due to the specific tendon injury at baseline and study conclusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been diagnosed with tendinitis in the elbow (medial or lateral epicondyles),
             patella, or Achilles tendon based on physical examination by a healthcare practitioner
             and medical history. Physical examination must include one of the following:
             assessment of pain during manual movements of the injured limb (e.g. a positive Mill's
             Test [Wadsworth, 1987] for elbow tendinitis), or local tenderness upon palpation over
             the tendon

          -  Experience tendon pain greater than 1 (using the VAS scale of 0-10) during the week
             preceding study screening
