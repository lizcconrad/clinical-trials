  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a
      personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy. The personalized polyepitope DNA vaccines will
      be formulated as naked plasmid DNA vaccines. The hypothesis of this study is that
      personalized polyepitope DNA vaccines will be safe for human administration and capable of
      generating measurable CD8 T cell responses to mutant tumor-specific antigens.

    <measure>Safety of the personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy, measured by both clinical observation and laboratory evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of plasmid DNA safety will include both clinical observation and laboratory evaluation. Safety will be closely monitored after injection with eight or more clinical and laboratory assessments in the first 24 weeks of the trial. The following parameters will be assessed following vaccination:
Local signs and symptoms
Systemic signs and symptoms
Laboratory evaluations, including blood counts and serum chemistries
Adverse, and serious adverse events</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity of the personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy, measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function, and multiparametric flow cytometry</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity will be measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function, and multiparametric flow cytometry. In both assays the quantity and quality of antigen-specific CD8 T cells is determined; the ELISPOT analysis is based on measuring the frequencies of IFN-γ producing T cells in response to polyepitope antigen, whereas the multiparametric flow cytometry assesses phenotypic as well as functional characteristics of epitope-specific CD8 T cells. In the proposed study, blood samples will be collected at multiple time points (n=8) and PBMC isolated and cryopreserved. Upon completion of the vaccination protocol, all samples will be analyzed simultaneously in order to minimize assay-to-assay variation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

          -  ER and PR less than Allred score of 3 or less than 1% positive staining cells in the
             invasive component of the tumor. Patients not meeting this pathology criteria, but
             have been clinically treated as having TNBC, can be enrolled at PI discretion.

          -  HER2 negative by FISH or IHC staining 0 or 1+.

          -  Consented for genome sequencing and dbGAP-based data sharing and has provided or will

             allowed

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation.

          -  Received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy within the last 30 days
             (neoadjuvant chemotherapy excluded).

          -  Experiencing any clinically significant adverse events above Grade 1 (according to
             CTCAE 4.0) due to agents administered more than 30 days earlier. However, patients
             with Grade 2 Alopecia will be considered eligible.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia (including sinus bradycardia), or psychiatric illness/social situation that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,
             Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,

             or any other medical condition or use of medication (e.g., corticosteroids) which
             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease that does not require daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Any
             patients receiving steroids should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7
             days before study entry.

          -  The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this
             study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer
             survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met: (1) patient has
             undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies, (2) patients have
             been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).

             complicated by study participation.

          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.

          -  Subjects with a strong likelihood of non-adherence such as difficulties in adhering to
             follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the Siteman Cancer Center should
             not knowingly be registered.

          -  Individuals in whom a skinfold measurement of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue
             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
