      The investigators aim to evaluate cancer control, genitourinary, rectal and overall
      health-related quality of life outcomes and effectiveness of focal therapy for localised
      prostate cancer using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven prostate cancer on trans-rectal or transperineal template
             prostate biopsies

          -  Template biopsy:

               -  unilateral disease (Gleason ≤4+3)

               -  bilateral disease: presence of clinically significant cancer in both sides
                  (Gleason ≤4+3) OR clinically insignificant disease with a burden of &gt;50% of
                  biopsy cores taken on that side, OR bilateral clinically insignificant disease
                  and &lt;50% of biopsy cores positive on any one side but with dominant disease
                  burden on one side

          -  Stage T1-T2cN0M0 disease, as determined by local guidelines (radiological T3a
             permitted)

          -  Serum PSA ≤15

          -  Life expectancy of ≥10 years

          -  Signed informed consent by patient

          -  An understanding of the German language sufficient to understand written and verbal
             information about the trial and consent process

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men who have had androgen suppression/hormone treatment within the previous 12 months
             for their prostate cancer

          -  Men with evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone
             scan or cross-sectional imaging

          -  Men with an inability to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound

          -  Men with latex allergies as the HIFU probe is covered with a latex condom sheath prior
             to insertion into the back passage

          -  Men who have undergone prior significant rectal surgery preventing insertion of
             trans-rectal HIFU probe (decided on the type of surgery in individual cases)

          -  Men who have had previous HIFU, cryosurgery, thermal or microwave therapy to the
             prostate.

          -  Men who have undergone a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) for
             symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms within 6 months. These patients may be
             included within the trial if deferred from consenting and screening until at least 6
             months following the TURP.

          -  Men not fit for major surgery as assessed by a Consultant Anaesthetist

          -  Men unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac
             pacemaker, metallic implant etc likely to contribute significant artefact to images)

          -  Presence of metal implants/stents in the urethra

          -  Presence of prostatic calcification and cysts (on transrectal ultrasound) whose
             location will interfere with effective delivery of HIFU therapy

          -  Men with renal impairment with a glomerular filtration rate of &lt;35ml/min (unable to
             tolerate Gadolinium dynamic contrast enhanced MRI).
