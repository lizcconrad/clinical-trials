  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the main site of healthcare-associated infections
      in the brain injured patients, with an incidence rate of 22% to 58%. VAP increases
      morbi-mortality, length of stay in intensive care and overall management costs. The
      prevention of ICU nosocomial infections depends on several measures : orotracheal intubation
      route, maintaining tube cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm of water (H2O), maintaining a
      semi-seated position &gt;= 30°, nasal and oropharyngeal care at regular intervals, striving to
      avoid unscheduled extubation, and use of a written sedation-analgesia algorithm allowing for
      early weaning from ventilation. Two randomized study show that administration of antibiotic
      therapy after intubation reduces the risk of early VAP incidence. However, in clinical
      practice, its administration solely purposes of limiting VAP occurence is not presently
      recommended. Indeed, to date no placebo blind controlled study was been realized and the fear
      of development of bacterial resistance remains stronger than the efficiency of this
      prevention measure. This aim of the present study is to show by a placebo randomized study
      that 2g of Ceftriaxone within 8 hours post-intubation after a brain injury decrease the risk
      of occurence an early VAP.

      Ancillary study An ancillary study is performed in 2 centres which routinely practice rectal
      swabs at admission and discharge of ICU, to survey intestinal flora (CHU of Angers and CHU of
      Rennes). The goal of this study is to compare the incidence of acquired cephalosporin
      resistant gram negative bacteria at the discharge of ICU between the 2 groups of patients,
      receiving or not ceftriaxone.
