  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether a group of resident physicians otherwise
      naïve to robotic surgery can demonstrate equal levels of proficiency during their first
      robotic supracervical hysterectomy having received training either with the Mimic dV-Trainer
      or the daVinci Skills Simulator.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Operative Time</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of supracervical hysterectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Operative time will be measured by time elapsed between first grasp of the uterine fundus with the robotic single tooth tenaculum until amputation of the specimen at the internal cervical os.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>during the surgical procedure</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the blood suctioned into the canister throughout the hysterectomy and at the end of the amputation discounting irrigation volume.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Skill Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>following completion of the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the global assessment tool for evaluation of intraoperative laparoscopic skills (GOALS) tool via video assessment. These ratings will be performed by a group of surgeons who are not involved in the study and are masked as to the identity of the study surgeons.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continued success with robotic surgery after participation in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>during the 12 months following surgical procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The number of cases each participating resident performs as primary surgeon the 12 months after completion of the study will be recorded</description>
