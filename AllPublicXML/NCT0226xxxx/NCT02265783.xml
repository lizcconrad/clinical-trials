    <measure>Report the Time Until the Device Posts &quot;Sensor Off&quot; After the Sensor is Removed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute per event, multiple events per subject. Total duration up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>A series of sensor-off events were collected from subjects in the study using marketed, off-the-shelf sensors. Each event was marked as pass if event duration (Timeend - Timestart) was less than or equal to 60 seconds; otherwise, the event was marked as greater than or equal to 60 seconds. The acceptance criteria is if 90% of the time the product posts Sensor Off, or any equal or higher priority alarm, within 60 seconds after sensor is removed.</description>

    <description>Volunteers are subjected to certain simulated, sensor removal conditions known to represent challenges to the sensor-off feature. Such conditions include exposing the sensor to an ambient light source, sensor slipping off the finger with the light emitter and detector facing each other or a sensor slipping off under a blanket.</description>
