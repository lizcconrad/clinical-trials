  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) will prevent
      the future development of CDI. This is also known as fecal bacteriotherapy or stool
      transplant.

      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of
      autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT) for prevention of Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) in patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (allo-HSCT). Patients will be enrolled prior to allo-HSCT; feces will be
      collected and stored from all participating subjects prior to the initiation of conditioning
      regimens, analyzed by deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and tested by assay for intestinal
      pathogens including Clostridium difficile. Later in the course of transplantation, following
      engraftment (defined as the first day of three consecutive days, that the absolute blood
      neutrophil count is at above f 500 mm3), subjects will undergo fecal testing for presence of
      Bacteroidetes by 16S PCR. Subjects will be eligible for study if they have a
      microbiologically diverse pre-transplant colonic microbiota, and if the post-engraftment
      specimen contains Bacteroidetes at a prevalence equal to or below (0.1%)

    <description>Prior to transplant hospitalization, store feces for testing and possible future use. Patients undergo fecal microbiota transplantation with the subject's stored pre-transplantation feces. The post-engraftment Bacteroidetes testing, randomization, and fecal microbiota transplantation procedure should all be performed within a 28-day window, beginning on the first day of engraftment. In the event that engraftment occurs prior to day +7, the 28-day window will start on day +7. Subjects from both arms will be followed for one year after transplantation for development of CDI, which will be treated by their BMT clinicians per the standards of care at MSKCC. Subjects from both arms will also be assessed for infections and graft-versus-host disease. During the follow-up period, fecal specimens will be collected serially, if feasible, until one year post randomization and analyzed for microbial diversity and composition.</description>
