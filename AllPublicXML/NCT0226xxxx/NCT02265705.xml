        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of adult-onset RA as defined by the ACR/European League Against
             Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 Criteria for the Classification of RA.

          -  Have moderately to severely active RA defined as the presence of at least 6/68 tender
             joints and at least 6/66 swollen joints.

          -  Have a CRP (or hsCRP) measurement â‰¥ 6 mg/liter (L) based on the most recent data (if
             available).

          -  Have had regular use of MTX for at least the 12 weeks prior to study entry at a dose
             that, in accordance with local clinical practice, is considered acceptable to
             adequately assess clinical response. The dose of MTX must have been a stable,
             unchanging oral dose of 7.5 to 25 mg/week (or the equivalent injectable dose) for at
             least the 8 weeks prior to study entry. The dose of MTX is expected to remain stable
             throughout the study and may be adjusted only for safety reasons.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently receiving corticosteroids at doses &gt;10 mg of prednisone per day (or
             equivalent) or have been receiving an unstable dosing regimen of corticosteroids
             within 2 weeks of study entry or within 6 weeks of planned randomization.

          -  Have started treatment with NSAIDs within 2 weeks of study entry or within 6 weeks of
             planned randomization or have been receiving an unstable dosing regimen of NSAIDs
             within 2 weeks of study entry or within 6 weeks of planned randomization.

          -  Are currently receiving concomitant treatment with MTX, hydroxychloroquine, and
             sulfasalazine or combination of any 3 conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic
             drugs (cDMARDs).

          -  Are currently receiving or have received cDMARDs (for example, gold salts,
             cyclosporine, azathioprine, or any other immunosuppressives) other than MTX,
             hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day), or sulfasalazine (up to 3000 mg/day) within 8
             weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Have received leflunomide in the 12 weeks prior to study entry (or within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry if the standard 11 days of cholestyramine is used to washout
             leflunomide).

          -  Have started a new physiotherapy treatment for RA in the 2 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Have ever received any biologic DMARD (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF),

          -  Have a diagnosis of any systemic inflammatory condition other than RA such as, but not
             limited to, juvenile chronic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, active vasculitis or gout.

          -  Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the most recent available
