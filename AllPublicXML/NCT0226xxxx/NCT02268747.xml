  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, monocentric, uncontrolled phase II trial with Dacomitinib, a pan-HER
      inhibitor, in unresectable or metastatic skin SCC.

      HER2 expression is common in skin SCC, being reported with high rates, even if in small
      studies.

      Coexpression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 is present in skin SCCs but not in normal skin and it
      could be associated with the malignant phenotype. In this frame Dacomitinib could play a role
      in the increase of the response rate.

  <detailed_description>

      The patients will assume Dacomitinib 30 mg daily for the first 2 weeks. If the highest skin
      toxicity will be of grade &lt;2, then the patients will start dacomitinib at 45 mg once daily
      and they will be clinically assessed every cycle (i.e. every 28 days).

      If the highest skin toxicity will be grade &gt;2, then the patient will interrupt the treatment
      following the criteria for dose reduction.

      Tumor evaluation will be performed at baseline and every other cycle. Response will be
      assessed according to RECIST 1.1. The patient will continue to assume the study drug until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any medical condition that will suggest to stop
      the treatment for patient's safety

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent to treatment

          -  Histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin not amenable to surgical
             treatment with curative purposes or with clinical contraindication to surgery
             (examples of medical contraindications to surgery include but are not limited to: skin
             SCC that has recurred in the same location after two or more surgical procedures and
             curative resection is deemed unlikely; anticipated substantial morbidity and/or
             deformity from surgery (e.g., removal of all or part of a facial structure, such as
             nose, ear, eyelid, eye; or requirement for limb amputation); anticipated difficulty in
             obtaining a curative resection due to the location of the tumour, the size of disease;
             anticipated difficulty in reconstructing the area that will be surgically removed;
             significant comorbidities that preclude the feasibility of a radical surgery
