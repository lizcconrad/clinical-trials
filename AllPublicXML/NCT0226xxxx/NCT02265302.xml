  <brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Biological Effects and Pharmacokinetics of BIIL 284 BS in Healthy Males</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Biological Effects and Preliminary Pharmacokinetics of Increasing Single Oral Doses of BIIL 284 BS (Dose Range: 0.025 mg - 75 mg PSE Solution, 25 mg, 75 mg, 250 mg and 750 mg WIF Tablets) in Healthy Male Volunteers as Well as Food Effects at 75 mg (WIF Tablet)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to obtain information about the safety and tolerability of BIIL 248 BS, to find the
      pharmacologically active dose range for the two formulations PSE 1% and WIF tablets by
      determination of the surrogate marker CD11b (= Mac-1) and to obtain preliminary
      pharmacokinetic data as well as first information on food effects after administration of the
      75 mg WIF tablet in healthy male volunteers
