    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy confirmed, untreated, low-grade B-cell lymphoma, including follicular (Grade 1,
             2, or 3A) [Harris, Swerdlow et al. 2008] or marginal, or CLL/SLL with lymph node
             involvement.

          -  At least 2 sites of measurable disease per Cheson criteria (must measure at least 1.5
             cm in any diameter or 1.0 cm in the shortest diameter if one of the diameters is not ≥
             1.5 cm), one of which must be palpable and easily accessible in a low-risk site (eg,
             inguinal, axillary, cervical, subcutaneous) for intratumoral injection (denoted as
             &quot;Lesion A&quot; in Treatment Cycle 1) and at least one additional untreated lesion that is
             located outside the radiation field of the treated lesion (Lesion A) and is accessible
             for an FNA aspirate.

          -  International normalized ratio or prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is
             receiving anticoagulant therapy and the PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must
             be within the therapeutic range of the intended use of anticoagulants.

          -  Activated PTT (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy,
             and the PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.

          -  Female subjects must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to taking study medication if of childbearing potential as defined in this
             protocol. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 medically
             acceptable method of contraceptive from Day 1 through 120 days after the last dose of
             trial treatment. The 2 medically acceptable birth control methods can be either 2
             barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The
             following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom
             (by the partner), cooper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide as per local
             regulations or guidelines. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any

             disease at study entry

          -  Any other significant medical or psychiatric condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             difficulty complying with protocol requirements that may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or study drug administration that may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the subject inappropriate for this study

          -  History of sensitivity to any component of SD-101

          -  A diagnosis of cancer within the last 3 years prior to enrollment or any known
