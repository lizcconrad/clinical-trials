  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase 2 dose of APTO-253 HCl in patients with relapsed or
      refractory hematologic malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase 1b dose escalation with two disease specific expansions,
      multicenter, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or appropriate dose if MTD not reached to identify the recommended phase
      2 dose of APTO-253 HCl in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies.

    <description>APTO-253 HCl will be given in ascending doses in patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma or multiple myeloma until the maximum administered dose or appropriate dose is reached. Enrollment of approximately up to 15 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and 15 patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma is anticipated in the dose escalation portion, followed by up to 30 patients enrolled in the expansion cohort at the recommended dose in two specific indications selected from the dose escalation experience.</description>
