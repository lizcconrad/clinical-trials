    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because a previous research MRI of
      their hips showed that the shape of the head of their thigh bone may indicate FAI of the hip.
      We have already collected cartilage imaging data and data on how the hip joint moves on
      people with painful/symptomatic FAI and people with normal hip function. We would now like to
      compare the motion of the hip joint to those with painful FAI using ultrasound.

      Hip impingement is thought to be a leading cause of hip osteoarthritis, and occurs due to
      deformities in the hip joint. However some individuals have these deformities but do not
      exhibit symptoms. Using the standard magnetic resonance imaging and clinical tests it is not
      clear which deformities will cause degeneration, requiring surgical intervention. We propose
      to evaluate the deformity and impingement between the femur and acetabulum using dynamic
      ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound does not involve radiation and can acquire video of the hip
      joint and is thus suitable for such diagnostic purposes. In this pilot study we will evaluate
      the feasibility of ultrasound in diagnosing hip impingement.
