    <textblock>
      Patients with extensive disease(ED) small cell lung cancer is still have a dismal prognosis,
      even though the first line chemotherapy showing about 70% response rate. Most of the patients
      will relapse with in 6 months after the chemotherapy and the following therapy such as second
      line chemotherapy have a very limited efficacy to these patients. Currently, there is no
      standard 3rd line therapy for the patients with ED small cell lung cancer(SCLC).

      As the investigators know, Nab-paclitaxel had showing promising efficacy in several cases
      report in the patients with SCLC, the aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel as a single agent in the SCLC patients with extensive
      disease and failed to first line/ second line chemotherapy.
