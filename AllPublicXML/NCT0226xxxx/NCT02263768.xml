  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of two recall intervals on dental caries incidence
      (primary outcome) in preschool children with low and moderate caries risk. The level of
      anxiety, oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL), time and cost (secondary outcomes)
      according to each interval will also be assessed. Methods: The sample will consist of 224
      children between 3-5 years of age, of both genders, with low and moderate caries risk
      according to the clinical criteria adapted from the Secretary of Health of São Paulo.
      Children will be randomly allocated into two study groups: Group 1 (G1) - oral clinical
      examination + orientation for oral health and diet on the recall of 12 months; and Group 2
      (G2) - oral clinical examination + orientation for oral health and diet on the recall of 18
      months.

      An examiner calibrated and blinded to the study groups and the secondary outcomes will
      perform the clinical examinations, which consist of: the gingival bleeding index, dental
      plaque index, detection of caries and its activity according to the ICDAS (International
      Caries Detection and Assessment System) and the clinical features of active and inactive
      caries lesions will be associated with the criteria discribed in ICDAS Commitee manual. An
      external dentist will conduct the assessment of the anxiety levels assessed by the Facial
      Image Scale, the OHRQoL measured by B-ECOHIS (Brazilian Early Childhood Oral Health Impact
      Scale), the time and costs. All groups will be followed for a period of 36 months. All
      analyzes will be performed with the intention of treatment (ITT) and considering the
      sensitivity analyzes to assess the differences between the ITT analyzes and the complete
      cases analyzes.

    <description>Dental caries will be assessed using the ICDAS criteria (Ismail AI, Sohn W, Tellez M, Amaya A, Sen A, Hasson H, et al.

    <description>Oral health related quality of life will be assessed using the Brazilian validation of the ECOHIS (Scarpelli AC, Oliveira BH, Tesch FC, Leão AT, Pordeus IA, Paiva SM.

    <description>The time in minutes, used in the recall interval visits, will be recorded in four categories: time spent on clinical examination including prophylaxis, hygiene and diet orientations, and time spent when the patient miss the recall visit. The total time will correspond to the sum of these categories.</description>

    <description>Costs in real (continuous variable) will be recorded in two categories: salary of the dentist and dental assistant paid in public dental services in São Paulo, cost of dental materials/products used in the appointment.</description>
