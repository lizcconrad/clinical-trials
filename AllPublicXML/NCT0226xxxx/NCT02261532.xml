  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single group Phase 1 study of TAS-102, evaluating the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity. Blood sampling will be performed during the
      first cycle (Day1 and Day 12) of therapy in all consenting patients.
