        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants in the study were cystic fibrosis patients:

          -  Male or female ≥6 years (pediatrics 6 - 17 years; adult ≥18 years); minimum weight
             requirement of 20 kg

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF (positive sweat chloride ≥60 milliequivalents (mEq)/liter
             (by pilocarpine iontophoresis) and/or a genotype with two identifiable mutations
             consistent with CF accompanied by one or more clinical features with the CF phenotype

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;25% predicted (using prediction
             equation's of Knudson)

          -  Clinically stable with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection
             or current pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Females of child bearing potential needed to have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and, if sexually active, had to be willing to use a double-barrier form of
             contraception for the duration of the study

          -  The patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative had to be able to give
             informed consent in accordance with international conference of harmonization (ICH)
             good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and local legislation

          -  The patient must be able to swallow the BIIL 284 BS tablet whole

          -  Patients taking a chronic medication must be willing to continue this therapy for the
             entire duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including medication allergy)
             which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the Investigator

          -  Patients who had participated in another study with an investigational drug within one
             month or 6 half-lives (whichever is greater) preceding the screening visit

          -  Patients with known substance abuse, including alcohol or drug abuse, within 30 days
             prior to screening

          -  Patients who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. strenuous sporting
             events) within 24 hours before the study

          -  Female patients who were pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients who were unable to comply with breakfast requirements prior to dosing

          -  Patients who had received IV, oral or inhaled antibiotics or corticosteroids for a
             pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Patients who had started a new chronic medication for CF within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Patients with documented persistent colonization with B. cepacia (defined as more than
             one positive culture within the past year)

          -  Patients with clinically significant findings on chest x-ray which in the opinion of
             the Investigator precludes the patient's participation in the trial

          -  Patients with oxyhemoglobin saturation in room air &lt;90% by pulse oximetry

          -  Patients with hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL; platelets &lt;100x109/L; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic
             transaminase (ALT) or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (AST) &gt;2 times the upper
             limit of normal; creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL at screening

          -  Clinically significant disease or medical condition other than CF or CF-related
             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the patient or the quality of the data. This includes significant hematological,
             hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and neurologic disease. Patients with diabetes may
             participate if their disease is under good control prior to screening.
