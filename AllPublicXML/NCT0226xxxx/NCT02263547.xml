      Primary Objective To determine if colestipol hydrochloride tablets can accelerate the
      elimination of teriflunomide. Teriflunomide will be administered for 14 days followed by
      colestipol dosing of 11 days. Total duration of the study is 40 days.

      Secondary Objectives To collect information on the pattern of side effects with use of
      colestipol hydrochloride after teriflunomide administration and to determine the best
      duration of therapy needed for adequate elimination

  <detailed_description>

      participants will be followed for 40 days to allow for time to administer a loading dose of
      teriflunomide and observe the elimination of that drug using colestipol hcl.
