          -  Have given written consent to participate after reading the information and consent
             form, and after having the opportunity to discuss the trial with the investigator or
             his/her delegate.

             subject.

          -  Presence of history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver

             creatinine value above the upper limit of the normal range. eGFR will be estimated
             using the modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation).

          -  Use of any prescription medicine or over the counter (OTC) medications, or herbal
             remedies (such as St John's wort), known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of

             dose of trial medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine (except as
             permitted), including dietary supplements or herbal remedies, during the 7 days before
             the first dose of trial medication.

          -  Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the dose and throughout the study
             period.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, e.g., as a blood
             donor.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of study
             medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly (for men) or 14 units of
             alcohol weekly (for women).

          -  Likely possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to volunteer entering the study.
