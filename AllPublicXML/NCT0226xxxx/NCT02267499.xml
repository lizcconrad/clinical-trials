  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involved Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and more specifically
      computer exercises blended with game activities. It was hypothesized that ICT facilitated,
      game blended combined cognitive and physical exercise improves global cognition when compared
      to a control group; and that the number of sessions within exercising participants predict
      cognitive benefits. In addition, we explored the impact of potential moderators on combined
      exercise-induced cognitive benefits.

      The multicenter study was part of the Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project
      (www.longlastingmemories.eu), which was funded by the European Commission (Information and
      Communication Technologies Policy Support Program (ICT-PSP) for a three year period
      (2009-2012). It used a pre-post-test design with the between-participant factor group
      [intervention vs. passive control]. Post-test was conducted within 2 weeks after completion
      of the exercise period. Interventions were carried out in Athens and Thessaloniki (Greece)
      within day care centers, hospitals, senior care centers, a memory outpatient center, local
      parishes, at university campus facilities (university community installations), and at
      participants' homes.

      Institutions had to provide at least 5 exercise weeks, with a frequency of at least 1
      physical and 2 cognitive exercise sessions per week, resulting in at least 5 physical and 10
      cognitive exercise sessions in total.
