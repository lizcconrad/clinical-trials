      The therapeutic effects of exercise in Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly reported,
      however the mechanisms are unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential
      mechanisms of exercise in the brain for the treatment of PD.

      Positron Emission Tomography will be used to measure dopamine neuron density, endogenous
      dopamine release and neuroimflammation. We will also use functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity. Assessments will be conducted before and after a
      12-week exercise intervention and 3-year follow-up. Participants will be randomly allocated
      into either an aerobic or a stretching intervention. Clinical measures of motor function,
      cognition and mood will also be assessed.

        exclusion criteria:

          1. significant cognitive impairment or depression;

          2. significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory disease - all subjects will
             undergo a screening exercise bicycle stress test; or

          3. failure to comply with the exercise or stretching intervention program by not
             completing at least 30 of the 36 exercise classes.
