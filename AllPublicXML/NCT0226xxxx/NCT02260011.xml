        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
        criteria:

          -  Patients must have stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV 1 (forced
             expiratory volume in the first second) &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;=70% of FVC
             (Forced Vital Capacity)

               -  Males: Predicted normal FEV1=0.093 (height in inches) - 0.032(Age) - 1.343

               -  Females: Predicted normal FEV1=0.085 (height in inches) - 0.025(Age) - 1.692

          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years

          -  Patients must be able to demonstrate an improvement in FEV1 &gt;=015% within one hour
             after inhalation of two puffs of Atrovent® inhalation aerosol (21 mcg per puff)

          -  Patients must be able to satisfactorily administer the medication, perform pulmonary
             function test and maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent form prior to participation in the trial
             (i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications and prior to
             fasting for laboratory tests)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant disease other than COPD were will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with clinical relevant baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. If
             the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the patient is
             excluded

          -  All patients with serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt;80 IU/L; serum
             glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL, or creatinine
             &gt;2.0 mg/dL will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory
             evaluation will not to be conducted in these patients

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or have a blood
             eosinophil count above 600/mm³. A repeat eosinophil count will not to be conducted in
             these patients

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure, patients
             with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, patients receiving any systemic beta
             blocker and patients on chronic daytime oxygen therapy

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed

          -  Patients with a history of life threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history or a thoracotomy for other reasons be evaluated as per exclusion criterion No.
             1

          -  Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the six
             weeks prior to screening visit (vist1) or during the baseline period

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients who are on cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

          -  Patients who are on antihistamines

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (e.g., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or Norplant®)

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or 6 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to the screening visit or patients currently
             enrolled in other research study

          -  Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse

        Exclusion criteria for patients with allergies

          -  Patients with active infectious rhinitis (common cold) as determined by history and
             physical

          -  Patients with upper or lower respiratory infection at screening
