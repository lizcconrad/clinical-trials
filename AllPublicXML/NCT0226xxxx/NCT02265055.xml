      A total of 193 infertile couples, attending the ART unit, International Islamic Center for
      Population Studies and Research (IICPSR), -Al- Azhar University in the period from December
      2010 to September 2012, were included in this study.

      The controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocol was performed according to a long GnRH
      agonist protocol starting in the midluteal phase (day 21) of the preceding cycle. Embryos
      were assessed at 25 - 27 hr after ICSI for early cleavage. Embryos which reached the two cell
      stage at this interval were classified as Early Cleavage (EC) embryos, and the remaining as
      Non Early Cleavage (NEC) embryos. Embryos were assessed again at 64 - 68 hours post-ICSI for
      day-three embryo morphology. Day 3 embryo transfer was done. The best two or three embryos,
      according to day 3 embryo morphology were transferred. The patients were subdivided into two
      subgroups; one will transfer early cleavage embryos (EC) and the other will transfer non
      early cleavage embryo (NEC).
