  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a simple and non-invasive method to monitor heart transplant
      patients with MRI. Its diagnostic and prognostic values have already been assessed in two
      monocentric studies. Other monocentric studies based on related methods have confirmed the
      investigators findings. These studies are insufficient to allow a large diffusion of the
      technique. Only a large multi-centric study will change medical practices. In addition, this
      project will spread the new method at a national level and will allow an assessment of its
      practical usefulness in centres not familiar with MRI T2 quantification.

      Furthermore, MRI seems to detect rejections at earlier stage than biopsy. A confirmation of
      this observation could lead to a modification of diagnostic criteria of cardiac graft
      rejection. The ultimate aim of the DRAGET project is to replace a strategy based solely on
      biopsy with one based on a first-line MRI (with biopsy only when needed) for a more efficient
      and earlier detection of rejection. This would constitute a major advance in patients
      security and comfort as well as an economic improvement.
