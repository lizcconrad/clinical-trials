  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of different combinations of 5 types of behavioral
      interventions across patient-centered outcomes. It will also evaluate which outcomes (e.g.
      quality of life, cognition, function, mood) matter most to people at risk for dementia and
      their care partners. The results of this study have the potential to direct patients,
      families, and health care providers as to which combinations of behavioral interventions
      provide the greatest potential impact on which dementia prevention outcomes. Greater use of
      behavioral strategies that are targeted to the outcomes of most important to the patient will
      likely improve patient compliance and treatment adherence. This, in turn, can lessen the need
      for medication, health care, and long term care utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be thought of as 'additive' trials where
      randomization leads to the addition of treatments beyond placebo. Participants are confronted
      with the probability of receiving placebo (no treatment). This leads many potential
      participants to not consent or to withdraw if they believe they are receiving no treatment.
      In contrast, the proposed trial will be 'subtractive'. This innovative approach to
      randomization will involve suppression of just 1 of the 5 treatment components. Thus, all
      participants will receive at least 80% of the menu of interventions offered in this trial.

    <description>Will provide each couple with memory compensation training 5 days per week for 2 weeks, with initial and ending adherence sessions. All sessions will involve 45- 60 minutes of training. The curriculum is described briefly here.
Learning phases. three training stages from learning theory: 1) an acquisition phase in which use of the memory compensation system is learned, 2) an application phase in which a participant is taught to apply to his/her daily life, and 3) an adaptation phase in which a participant practices incorporating into his/her daily life so as to make its use habitual.</description>

Participants will complete 45-60 minutes of training daily in the program and will be encouraged to maintain 250 minutes of computerized brain training per week for 18 months post program. Each participant's adherence and progress will be tracked through the clinician portal provided by Posit Science both during HABIT and for 18 months post-program.</description>
