      Our study perform In Department of Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University. In
      our study we divide patients into 3 groups ,First group patients doing Soap suds enema
      (S.S.E.), second group patients doing sodium chloride enema and the last group patient Non
      per os (NPO) before surgery. Our hypothesis is no different about surgical view in 3 groups
      and lower side effects in patients in no bowel preparation group.

      Research objectives

        1. Comparing the surgeon satisfaction ,surgical view and bowel handling in operation of
           soap suds enema group, sodium chloride enema group and the NPO group in patients under
           going exploratory laparotomy in gynecologic surgery.

        2. Comparing the side effects of soap suds enema group, sodium chloride enema group and the
           NPO group.

      Inclusion Criteria

      1. Women under going laparotomy in gynecologic surgery 2. Surgeon consider not too difficult
      surgery. 3. Can understanding Thai language. 4. Can communicate with researcher. 5.
      Consenting participants. Exclusion Criteria

        1. Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy.

        2. Laparoscopic surgery

        3. Do not consent to participate in research

        4. Gastrointestinal infection

        5. Underlying disease such as Intestinal disease, patient who cannot under going bowel
           preparation ,heart disease ,seizure.

        6. Surgeon consider difficult surgery such as fixed mass or uterus with others organs from
           per vaginal examination or very huge mass or history of difficult surgery or history of
           severe adhesion in abdominal cavity.

      Methods

        1. Divide patients into 3 groups ,First group patients doing Soap suds enema (S.S.E.),
           second group patients doing sodium chloride enema and the last group patient Non per os
           (NPO) before surgery

        2. Patients information such as age, height, weight, smoking, history of surgery, number of
           surgeries, diagnosis that required surgery. The complete blood count and the laboratory
           prior to surgery record by the research team.

        3. Patients do self questionnaire about symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort ,
           anxiety ,nausea and vomiting etc. these are for understanding symptoms of patients
           before bowel preparation perform.

        4. Computer-generated sequence into block for 30 person

        5. Random into 3 groups by nurses .in opaque envelopes with number infront of to identify
           patients. Surgeon must not know what group of these patients get in.

        6. Patients in S.S.E. group will bowel preparation by soap suds enema until clear at night
           before surgery.

        7. Patients in unison enema group will Unison enema 100 ml per rectal at night before
           surgery

        8. Patients NPO groups will NPO and no bowel preparation.

        9. Patients in all group are doing operative preparation such as NPO after midnight,
           retained foley catheter and clean abdomen and perineum before surgery. Closs matching
           blood.

       10. In the morning before surgery , patients do self questionnaire about symptoms score such
           as abdominal pain or discomfort , anxiety ,nausea and vomiting etc. for symptoms of
           patients after bowel preparation perform last night.

       11. In operation room , surgeon evaluate surgical view, bowel handling after use swabs for
           bowel packing and record by nurse and after operation finish surgeon evaluate
           satisfaction of operation.

       12. One day after surgery and before discharge from hospital patients do self questionnaire
           about symptoms score such as abdominal pain or discomfort , anxiety ,nausea and vomiting
           etc

Evaluation in operation
In operation room , surgeon evaluate surgical view, bowel handling after use swabs for bowel packing and record by nurse using visual analog scale score 0 to 10 that depend on surgical view and bowel handling, 0 is the worst surgical view and hardest bowel handling and 10 for extremely good surgical view and easiest bowel handling.
When the operation finished surgeon evaluate satisfaction of operation .</description>

Symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, thirsty, fatique, anxious, discomfort, abdominal pain , bloating, insomnia, ashamed, fecal incontinence.
Additional questions in morning before surgery are Do you feelng discomfort from these bowel preparation?, do you want to do the same bowel preparation method if you have to do next operation? and do you want to change to other methods?,</description>
