  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part dose-finding trial of MK-7680 in participants with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      infection of genotype (GT)1 (Part I) and GT3 (Part 2). The primary hypothesis is that daily
      administration of a safe and well tolerated dose of MK-7680 will produce a decrease in HCV
      viral load.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parts 1 and 2 will each consist of 4 panels. In the first panel, a 200 mg dose of MK-7680
      will be administered. In each of the following 3 panels, higher or lower doses of MK-7680
      will be administered. Each panel will only begin once the safety and tolerability data from
      the preceding panel have been evaluated.
