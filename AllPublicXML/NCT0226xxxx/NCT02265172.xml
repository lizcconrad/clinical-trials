  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with musculoskeletal pain in primary healthcare are referred to orthopaedic
      surgeon, however, a relatively low percentage of these patients are considered suitable for
      orthopaedic intervention.

      Physiotherapists are suitable for musculoskeletal assessments and are used as such in many
      countries i.e. Advanced Practice Physiotherapists or Extended Scope Physiotherapists,
      however, this is not an existing model of care in Sweden. To be able to consider this model
      for implementation in Sweden it is necessary to evaluate it from a healthcare as well as from
      a patient perspective.

      The study is a randomised controlled trial. Overall aim is to evaluate if a orthopaedic
      manual therapy assessment (physiotherapy) assessment of patients referred to orthopaedic
      surgeon bring any changes to referral routines, patient satisfaction and health-related
      variables when compared to standard practice.

      manual therapy assessment (physiotherapy) assessment of patients referred to orthopaedic
      surgeon bring any changes to referral routines, patient satisfaction and health-related

      physiotherapy assessment or standard practice (orthopaedic surgeon assessment).
