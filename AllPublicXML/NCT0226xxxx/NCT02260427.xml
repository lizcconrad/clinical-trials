  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are well established in anesthetic practice. Among these
      devices, the i-gel has been typically widely used. The self-pressurised air-Q intubating
      laryngeal airway (air-Q sp) is newly developed supraglottic airway devices. It is a new
      single-use device that may optimise the airway sealing while reducing the potential for
      postoperative complications such as sore throat. The overall structure of the air-Q sp is
      similar to the original air-Q, except the inflatable cuff. The aim of this randomized trial
      was to compare the clinical performance of the i-gel and the air-Q sp in elderly patients

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>airway leak pressure measured after device insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>within 5min after insertion of each device</time_frame>
    <description>Airway leak pressure was determined by adjusting the expiratory valve of the breathing circle to 40 cmH2O (fixed fresh gas flow 3 L/min) and recording the pressure when equilibrium was reached.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>insertion parameters (insertion time and ease of insertion)</measure>
    <time_frame>During and 1 min after insertion of each device</time_frame>
    <description>Insertion time was defined as the time from the attending anesthesiologist picking up the LMA until the confirmation on capnography. Ease of insertion was graded from 1 to 4.</description>
