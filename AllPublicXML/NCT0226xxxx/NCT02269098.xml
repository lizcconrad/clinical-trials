    <textblock>
      A 4 week prospective, randomized controlled study was carried out to assess the impact of a
      care delivery intervention which focused on blood glucose (BG) management among adults with
      type 2 diabetes presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with BG &gt; 200mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
      The intervention was designed by a multi-disciplinary team of ED physicians and nurses,
      endocrinologists and diabetes educators. The intervention incorporated three components: a
      guideline-based algorithm for diabetes medication management; survival skills diabetes
      self-management education (DSME); and support for health system navigation. The control group
      received usual care per the ED's policies and procedures for management of high blood
      glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We evaluated a concise diabetes care delivery intervention designed to advance glycemic
      medications and deliver diabetes self-management education (DSME) among adults with type 2
      diabetes presenting to the emergency department (ED) with uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The
      primary hypothesis was that there would be improvement in HbA1c.

      A 4 week, randomized controlled trial provided algorithm-based antihyperglycemic medications
      management, survival skills DSME and navigation to primary care for ED patients with BG &gt;
      200mg/dL. Medications were titrated and DSME delivered by endocrinologist-supervised
      certified diabetes educators. Controls received usual care.

    <description>Score on 8 item Modified Morisky Medication Scale used to assess medication adherence. This scale is a structured and widely used self reported questionnaire used to assess medication taking behaviors.The total score ranges from 0 to 8. A score of 0 is considered &quot;high&quot;adherence, 1 to 2 is considered &quot;medium&quot; adherence, and &gt;2 is considered &quot;low&quot; adherence.</description>

Metformin, sulfonylureas and basal insulin were included in the algorithm. Survival skills DSME included: BG meter instruction if the patient did not already have a meter or confirmation of self-BG monitoring technique if they did; instructions on how to self-inject insulin if prescribed; and information on BG targets, signs and treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, basic nutrition information and when to call the doctor or go to the ED.</description>

    <description>Usual ED care was provided to controls. Hyperglycemia was treated with rapid acting insulin and with IV hydration, if indicated. DM medications were added and/or doses were adjusted at the discretion of the ED physician and prescriptions provided. Insulin, however, was not prescribed as a new medication due to staff concerns regarding post-discharge hypoglycemia and lack of certainty of timely medical follow-up. Follow-up with primary care was recommended.</description>

    <description>As above plus- Follow-up intervention visits were at 24-72 hrs, 2 and 4 weeks. During each, further DSME was provided, BG logs reviewed, and diabetes medications adjusted as needed by the CDE. Meter and insulin injections skills were reinforced as needed. Outpatient navigation included securing a primary care appointment no later than 4 weeks after study completion. Final contact was via telephone at 90 days. The MMS© (Morisky Medication Adherence Survey) was taken at 2 and 4 weeks and during the final telephone visit. Interim return visits to the ED or admissions to the hospital were queried at each visit. A follow up HbA1C was obtained at week 4 using the POC A1CNow+ ®, and a venous HbA1C was drawn if the POC result was above 13% .</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Not all subjects completed the study, yet dropout rates by arm were similar. Medication adherence was self-reported - concurrent improvement in glycemic control was concordant with its improvement. Impact on ED return visits could not be determined.</limitations_and_caveats>
