  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the safety, and initial efficacy of using the ExAblate
      Transcranial to create a unilateral lesion in the globus pallidus as an adjunct to PD
      medications in subjects who are over 30 years of age and considered medication-refractory
      with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial clinical effectiveness of
      ExAblate Transcranial unilateral thermal ablation of the globus pallidus of subjects
      suffering from medication-refractory, advanced idiopathic PD.

      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety and clinical efficacy of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate the full clinical efficacy.

    <description>Safety will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of device- and procedure-related complications from the first treatment day visit through the 6 month post-treatment time point. All AEs will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the device, pallidotomy procedure, and/or Parkinson's disease progression. Alternative treatments for PD subject tremor will also be captured should they occur. Adverse events will be reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board at periodic intervals. Relative safety of the ExAblate Transcranial treatment will be evaluated as compared to other methodologies for creating pallidotomy as reported in the literature.</description>
