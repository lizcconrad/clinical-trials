  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of GSK2256294 exposure at steady state on pulmonary artery
      systolic pressure (PASP) in healthy volunteers, under hypoxic conditions, after 7 days of
      dosing. It is single centre, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to be
      conducted in approximately 30 healthy volunteers. Subjects will be screened no more than 30
      days. Subject will be admitted in clinical unit on Day -1. Subject will be dosed for 7 days
      in unit in morning on all days except for dosing on Days 3 -6. Dosing on Days 3 -6 will occur
      at home. Subjects will return to the unit on the evening of Day 6 and remain there until Day
      8. Subjects will undergo echocardiography under normoxic and hypoxic on Day 1 pre-dose and on
      Day 7 post-dose. Subject will be followed up for 28- 32 days after discharge. The maximum
      estimated time that a subject will be enrolled in the study is 62 days from the screening
      visit to follow up.

             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required] agree and document that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study

             stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to
             laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]; females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) must discontinue their HRT before the start of the study; for those
             whose menopausal status is in doubt, they will be required to use one of the highly
             effective contraception methods and may need to have a blood sample taken to check
             FSH/estradiol levels.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
             following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication

             of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in
             accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
             subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in protocol, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in

          -  History of pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN)
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

             rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF). The specific formula that will be used
             to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be
             determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different
             formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the
             lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For
             purposes of data analysis, QTcF will be used as specified in the Reporting and
             Analysis Plan (RAP).

             supplements), within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication until
             completion of the follow-up visit, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and
             sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study. - History of regular alcohol
             consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: For US sites: an average weekly
             intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. For

             (HBcAb) should also be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody.
