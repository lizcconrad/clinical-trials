  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase IIb/III study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NaBen® in
      improving the symptoms of schizophrenia in adults. NaBen® is granted Breakthrough Therapy
      Designation by US FDA as add-on treatment for schizophrenia. The trial is designed as a
      multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, in which adult subjects with
      schizophrenia will be enrolled. The study will include four parts: a 2 week Screening part, a
      4 week run-in part, an 8 week double-blind treatment part, and a 52 week Open-Label Extension
      part.

    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, phase IIb/III, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled
      study, in which adult subjects with schizophrenia will be enrolled. The study will include
      four parts: a 2 week Screening part, a 4 week run-in part, and 8 week double-blind treatment
      part, and a 52 week Open-Label Extension part.

      Screening part of the study:

      The subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Screening part of the study.

      Enrichment run-in part of the study:

      Subjects who are determined to be eligible will enter the Run-in part of the study. A total
      of 348 Subjects will be randomized. The randomized subjects will receive 4 weeks of NaBen® or
      Placebo accordingly. The subjects who have completed 4 weeks of randomized treatment in both
      groups (NaBen® or Placebo) will be assessed and categorized intoresponders and
      non-responders, based on 20% or more reduction from baseline in their PANSS total scores as
      per the evaluations at Visit 2 and Visit 4.

      Double-Blind treatment part of the study :

        -  Subjects who have successfully completed the Enrichment Run-in part will enter the
           Double- Blind treatment part of the study per below: NaBen® treated subjects: Subjects
           will continue receiving NaBen® for another 8 weeks.

        -  Placebo treated subjects:

             -  Placebo Responders: Subjects will continue receiving Placebo for another 8 weeks.

             -  Placebo Non-responders: Subjects will be re-randomized to receive NaBen® or Placebo
                in a 1:1 ratio for another 8 weeks.

      Open-Label Extension part of the study:

      All subjects who have completed the Double-Blind part of the study will continue with the
      Open-Label Extension part of the study to receive NaBen® for an additional 52 weeks, plus a 2
      week follow-up.
