  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an
      investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with
      standard-of-care (SoC) treatment in subjects with advanced-stage (i.e., metastatic) Lung
      Cancer. Vaccine will consist of P10s-PADRE admixed with an adjuvant, MONTANIDETM ISA 51 VG.
      Up to one hundred fifty (150) subjects with advanced-stage Lung Cancer of any histologic type
      will be enrolled for this vaccine trial.

      This single-arm, multi-site trial is designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of the
      vaccine in subjects with advanced-stage lung cancer. The primary objectives of the study are:
      (1) to monitor the safety and tolerability of the vaccine when it is administered in
      combination with SoC therapy; and (2) to determine whether immunization with vaccine can
      successfully elicit a robust immune response in subjects with advanced-stage lung cancer.

    <description>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has published standardized definitions for adverse events (AEs), known as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, also called &quot;common toxicity criteria&quot;), to describe the severity of organ toxicity for patients receiving cancer therapy. The tables describing AEs graded in the CTCAE (version 4.0) provides a references for adverse events reporting. From grade 1 AEs being minor/low grade adverse events to grade 5 AEs being serious adverse events usually resulting in death.</description>

          6. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 within 3 weeks prior to registration

          7. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) or alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) ≤ 2
             x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 3 weeks prior to
             registration
