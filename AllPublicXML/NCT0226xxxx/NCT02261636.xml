  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For both induction of remission and in maintenance of remission, different doses and
      treatment durations are used in practice. The aim of this study is to assess how mesalazine
      is used in clinical practice, at which doses and for how long and how these differences
      impact the patient disease state and work productivity.
