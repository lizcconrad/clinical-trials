  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open label multi-center study. Patients with high-risk
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (systemic mastocytosis [SM], advanced symptomatic
      hypereosinoophic disorder [PED], myelofibrosis [MF], and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      [CMML]) will be treated with SL-401, which will be administered as a brief intravenous
      infusion for 3 consecutive days initially every 21 days for 4 cycles; every 28 days for
      cycles 5-7; then every 42 days. Stage 1 will consist of a period in which several doses of
      SL-401 are evaluated. The Stage 2 portion will enroll up to 18 patients with each of the 2
      myeloproliferative malignancies: MF and CMML. In entirety, the Stage 2 portion will consist
      of up to 36 patients who will be treated at a maximum tolerated dose or maximum tested dose
      in which multiple dose-limiting toxicities are not observed (identified in Stage 1).

             hepatic function:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ institutional lower limit of normal
                  as measured by multigated acquisition scan or 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiogram
                  within 28 days prior to start of therapy and no clinically significant
                  abnormalities on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL (or ≤114 µmol/L)

               -  Serum albumin ≥3.2 g/dL (or ≥32 g/L) in the absence of receipt of (IV) albumin
                  within the previous 72 hours

               -  Bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL (or ≤26 µmol/L)

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  CPK ≤2.5 times the ULN

          4. If a woman of child bearing potential, the patient has a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 1 week prior to SL-401 treatment (intervals shorter than 1 week
             are acceptable, if required by institutional guidelines)

          5. The patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures or treatment

          6. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements, including follow-up for response assessments

          7. The patient agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of time in
             the study, and to continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods for 2 months after
             the last SL-401 infusion

          8. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥0.5×10⁹/L

        Additional Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with MF and CMML (Stages 1 and 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All Patients (Stages 1 and 2):

          1. Patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities Grade ≥2 from previous
             chemotherapy not readily controlled by supportive measures (excluding alopecia,
             nausea, and fatigue)

          2. Patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, wide-field radiation, or biologic
             therapy within 14 days of study entry

          3. Patient has received treatment with another investigational agent within 14 days of
             study entry or concurrent treatment with another investigational agent.

          4. Patient has previously received treatment with SL-401 or has a known hypersensitivity
             to any components of the drug product

          5. Patient has an active malignancy and/or cancer history (excluding myeloproliferative
             disorders and concomitant myeloid malignancies as specified in the inclusion criteria)
             that can confound the assessment of the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer
             history (within 2 years of entry) and/or ongoing active malignancy or substantial
             potential for recurrence must be discussed with the Sponsor before study entry.
             Patients with the following neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin
             cancer, carcinoma in situ (including superficial bladder cancer), cervical
             intraepithelial neoplasia, or organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of
             progressive disease

          6. Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any
             New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina,
             history of myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of study entry,
             uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not controlled by
             medication)

          7. Patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during
             the study

          8. Patient has known active or suspected disease involvement of the central nervous
             system (CNS). If suspected due to clinical findings, CNS disease should be ruled out
             with relevant imaging and/or examination of cerebrospinal fluid

          9. Patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with the exception of corticosteroids
             as specified in the inclusion criteria and tacrolimus, for treatment or prophylaxis of
             graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). If the patient has been on immunosuppressive
             treatment or prophylaxis for GVHD, the treatment(s) must have been discontinued at
             least 14 days prior to study drug and there must be no evidence of Grade ≥2 GVHD

         10. Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

         11. Patient is pregnant or breast feeding

         12. Patient has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

         13. Patient has evidence of active or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection.

         14. Patient is oxygen-dependent

         15. Patient has any medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion place the patient
             at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities
