  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this application is to compare and elucidate the effects of skill-based versus
      aerobic exercise versus control on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of the executive function
      (EF) subtype in Parkinson's disease (PD); we hypothesize that skill-based exercise will
      result in the greatest improvement in EF and lead to modification of underlying neural
      substrates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly of the executive function (EF) subtype, is
      common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and transitions to dementia, increased fall risk, and poor
      quality of life. EF is a set of processes that include mental flexibility and attention that
      are needed to learn and optimize performance of complex cognitive and motor skills. Such
      skills include the ability to generalize task performance under different conditions (context
      processing) and to perform two tasks simultaneously termed dual-task (DT) performance.
      Deficits in EF lead to problems in daily functioning and loss of independence and create
      psychosocial and economic burdens on patients and caregivers and stakeholders including
      health care providers. There is currently no effective treatment in PD to address EF
      deficits. Our animal and clinical studies in PD demonstrate that skilled exercise facilitates
      neuroplasticity of the basal ganglia (BG), a brain region sub-serving EF and supports the
      hypothesis that exercise will reverse EF deficits in PD. Furthermore, recent studies in
      healthy aging support that skill-based exercise that specifically promotes motor skill
      fitness (MSF), compared with aerobic exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness (CF), has
      a greater impact on EF and related BG circuits. The aim of this application is to compare and
      elucidate the effects of skill-based versus aerobic exercise versus control on MCI of the EF
      subtype in PD; we hypothesize that skill-based exercise will result in the greatest
      improvement in EF and lead to modification of underlying neural substrates.

    <description>The skill-based exercise program is designed to improve skilled function, fine and gross- motor body coordination. The intervention will be focused on acquisition and improvement of complex movements for the whole body and include the following general categories of activities: (1) balance, (2) eye-hand coordination, (3) leg-arm coordination; 4) reaction time to moving objects/persons; (5) dynamic gait and 6) functional activity performance. The treating therapist will direct both general principles of progression and progression specific to each category.</description>

    <intervention_name>Aerobic Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The aerobic cardiovascular exercise will consist of 36 1-hour sessions performed 3 times weekly over 12 weeks. Aerobic exercise will consist of cycling on a recumbent stationary bicycle. Each session will begin and end with gentle stretching. Continuous cycling will be performed for 45-50 minutes, with the first and last 5 minutes designated as warm-up and cool-down periods. The intensity of the middle 30 minutes of cycling will be increased progressively from an initial target of 50% maximum heart rate (HR) during week 1 to 75% of maximum HR by week 12. The initial intensity will be set at 50% of maximum HR. Participants will be encouraged to cycle as fast as they can, with a goal of maintaining 90 revolutions per minute (RPM) throughout the middle 30-minute period. Pedaling resistance will be kept low throughout all sessions. Measures of heart rate via heart rate monitors, blood pressure, RPM, and rate of perceived exertion will be recorded at 5-minute intervals.</description>

    <description>The control Social Contact group will consist of an equal amount of social contact as the exercise group. Subjects will have weekly visits at the University of Southern California with the study coordinator. The goal is for 3 hours of social contact every week for a total of 36 hours over 12 weeks. Activities scheduled for the social contact visits will include: (1) support group interactions and (2) social outings such as a trip to a museum, local café for lunch or dinner; (3) book club; (4) sports event. Support group interaction can include discussions among patients and caregivers, presentations from experts in various aspects of PD. They will be instructed to continue with their usual level of activity but refrain from beginning new exercise activities during the study period.</description>
