    <textblock>
      To investigate the relative bioavailability of telmisartan respectively of dipyridamole after
      concomitant administration of 80 mg telmisartan in Micardis® and 25 mg acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA)/200 mg extended release (ER) dipyridamole (DP) in Aggrenox® (Test 1) relative to ER-DP
      in Aggrenox® alone (Reference 1), respectively relative to telmisartan in Micardis® alone
      (Reference 2).

      To investigate the relative bioavailability of dipyridamole respectively of telmisartan
      administered as 25 mg ASA/200 mg ER-DP 30 minutes after intake of 80 mg telmisartan (Test 2)
      relative to dipyridamole in Aggrenox® alone (Reference 1), respectively relative to
      telmisartan in Micardis® alone (Reference 2).
