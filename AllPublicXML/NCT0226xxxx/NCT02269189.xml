             weight requirement of 20 kg

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF (positive sweat chloride ≥ 60 milliequivalents (mEq)/liter
             (by pilocarpine iontophoresis) and/or a genotype with two identifiable mutations
             consistent with CF accompanied by one or more clinical features with the CF phenotype

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt; 25% predicted (using prediction
             equation's of Knudson et al)

          -  Clinically stable with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection
             or current pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening
             and, if sexually active, must be willing to use a double-barrier form of contraception
             for the duration of the study

          -  The patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative must be able to give
             informed consent in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)

          -  The patient must be able to swallow the BIIL 284 tablet whole

          -  Patients taking a chronic medication must be willing to continue this therapy for the
             entire duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including medication allergy)
             which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the Investigator

          -  Patients who have participated in another study with an investigational drug
             (including BI Trial 543.36) within one month or 6 half-lives (whichever is greater)
             preceding the screening visit

          -  Patients with known substance abuse, including alcohol or drug abuse, within 30 days
             prior to screening

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating

             pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Patients who have started a new chronic medication for CF within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Patients with documented persistent colonization with B. cepacia (defined as more than
             one positive culture within the past year)

          -  Patients with clinically significant findings on chest x-ray which in the opinion of
             the Investigator precludes the patient's participation in the trial

          -  Patients with oxyhemoglobin saturation in room air &lt; 90% by pulse oximetry

          -  Patients with hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL; platelets &lt; 100x10**9/L; prothrombin time (PT) &gt;
             1.5 times the upper limit of normal, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (ALT) or
             serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (AST) &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal;
             creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL (adults) or &gt; 1.4 mg/dL (pediatrics) at screening

          -  Clinically significant disease or medical condition other than CF or CF-related
             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the patient or the quality of the data. This includes significant hematological,
             hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and neurologic disease. Patients with diabetes may
             participate if their disease is under good control prior to screening.
