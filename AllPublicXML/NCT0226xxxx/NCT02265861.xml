    <textblock>
      This research is to investigate the response of vascular active factors, vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensin-Ⅱ (AT-Ⅱ) to ovary stimulation during 24h in patients
      with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Controled prospective clinical study involved 60 women
      undergoing in vitro fertilization. Fifty-two patients with PCOS and 8 control cases were
      stimulated with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) during the early follicular phase of the
      menstrual cycle (4st to 7th days of the cycle).The blood was sampled before the injection (0
      hour) and at the 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours points after the stimulation. VEGF, AT-Ⅱ were
      measured by radioimmunoassay.

      After ovary stimulation, the level of VEGF in typical PCOS patients is obviously increased at
      the 3hs time point (p&lt;0.05), while there is no difference with VEGF at all other time point
      among the four groups. As for AT-Ⅱ, before and after the ovary stimulation, at all time
      points, the AT-Ⅱ levels in serum of patients with different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam
      criteria are all higher than the controls without PCOS. After the ovary stimulation, AT-Ⅱ in
      typical PCOS patients is obviously increased at 3hs time point, p&lt;0.05. The response of VEGF
      and AT-Ⅱ to HCG in women with typical PCOS is higher in 24 hours after the stimulation during
      the early follicular phase. The response to the stimulation is different in patients with
      different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria. Serum VEGF and AT-Ⅱ levels as a possible
      contributor to a great risk of developing OHSS in patients with typical PCOS during the early
      follicular phase in 24 hours after the ovary stimulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of 60 women were recruited and divided into four groups by Rotterdam criteria
             according to three typical characters:

               1. biochemical characteristics of hyperandrogenism (HA)

               2. chronic anovulation

               3. polycystic ovary morphology (PCO).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All women were matched for age (&lt;35 yr).

          -  All subjects were screened, and no other endocrine disturbances (thyroid, adrenal) or
             medical illnesses were found.

          -  All the patients did not have any hormonal preparation during the 3 months preceding
             the study.
