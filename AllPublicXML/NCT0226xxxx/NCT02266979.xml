      As the resolution of the Brazilian Federal Council of Nursing (COFEN) sizing the framework of
      nursing professionals is essential to ensure the safety and quality of patient care. To
      achieve such goals actions are needed to evaluate the variety of tasks and performance
      specific to each area in nursing profession. The National Agency for Health Surveillance
      (ANVISA), through Board Resolution (RDC-154) determines that the nurse to patient ratio is 1
      to 30 in hemodialysis and 1 to 50 on peritoneal dialysis, however these targets are not based
      on any evidence, and same apply to other Latin-American countries. Objective: To determine
      the appropriate nurse: patient ratio for peritoneal dialysis unit. Method: This research will
      be developed in two phases. The first with an observational design with descriptive and
      qualitative approach. There will be a focus group with experts in the field, to defined the
      activities and responsibilities of the peritoneal dialysis nurse, and produce a tool with a
      list of activities. A time-orientated score will be created. In the second stage a
      cross-sectional quantitative approach will be used. To apply the instrument from by direct
      observation of activities performed by nurses during their workday. With the instrument
      activities will be timed and the overall time of each nursing activity will be determined by
      multiplying the time spent by the total number of patients. It is expected tat this strategy
      will increase time on treatment and/or decrease dropout rates, by developing an easy test/
      formula application to determine the correct ratio according to the peritoneal dialysis
      program. This tool will provide better outcomes for patients as well as allow for growth of
      peritoneal dialysis programs with qualified assistance and patient safety.

      Research question:

      Can a time-oriented score system and expert consensus be applied to PD to develop an easy and
      repeatable system to evaluate work load for peritoneal dialysis nurses to achieve the best
      outcomes and allow for planned growth of the unit?
