  <brief_summary>

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative efficacy of topical lidocaine on
      reducing pain associated with the application of nasal CPAP in preterm infants
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants admitted to NICUs are exposed to a range of painful procedures. The exposure
      to pain during this critical of brain development may have adverse consequences. Application
      of nasal CPAP is one of the painful procedures. A consensus statement on neonatal pain made
      recommendations for analgesia for neonatal procedures. Topical lidocaine is frequently used
      as a topical anesthetic during venipuncture, heel lancing, circumcision, endotracheal
      intubations, nasogastric tube insertion, endoscopy and bronchoscopy. However, the use of
      topical lidocaine for its analgesic effect on application of nasal CPAP has not been
      evaluated.

      This study proposes a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of
      topical lidocaine on reducing pain associated with the application of nasal CPAP in preterm
      infants.

    <measure>The Premature Infant Pain (PIPP) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after application of nasal CPAP (approx 5 min)</time_frame>
    <description>PIPP comprises 3 behavioral variables (time of brow bulge, eye squeeze, and naso-labial furrow), 2 physiologic variables (changes in heart rate and SpO2), and 2 contextual variables (gestational age and behavioral state). Behavioral state ranges from &quot;active/awake, eyes open, facial movements&quot; to &quot;quiet/sleep, eyes closed, no facial movements.&quot; Every variable will be scored on a scale from 0 to 3. A total score the sum of total of points indicating: lack of pain (0-6), mild -moderate pain (6-12) and severe pain (above 12). PIPP has documented reliability and validity and have been used previously in several studies in neonates. PIPP score measurement will be based on video recording the infant for 45 seconds. Three different DVDs will be compiled with the sets in random order. Three different nurses from NICU will be recruited to evaluate the segments. They will not be informed of the nature of the study. All 3 nurses are trained in performing the PIPP.</description>

    <measure>Salivary cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minute after application of nasal CPAP</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary samples will be obtained 30 minutes after application of nasal CPAP using sterile single channel 500 μl pipette (Dragon Laboratory Instruments Limited, Beijing 101318 China). After collection, the saliva wll be centrifuged, frozen and stored at −70°C. The samples will later analysed using ELISA technique; IBL kits (IBL International GmbH, Flughafenstr. 52A, 22335 Hamburg, Germany).</description>

    <measure>Duration of first cry</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after application of nasal CPAP (approx 5 min)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of the first cry will be defined as audible distressed vocalizations with a continuous pattern before a quiet interval of 5 seconds soon after application of nasal CPAP</description>

Cardiovascular side effects: bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest.
