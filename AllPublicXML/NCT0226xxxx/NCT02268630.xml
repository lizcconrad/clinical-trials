    <textblock>
      This prospective observational follow-up study is designed to assess the long-term outcomes
      after Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to assess the effect of the new oral anticoagulant
      (NOAC) rivaroxaban on the prevalence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

      The study will not be testing any formal hypothesis.

    <textblock>
      This prospective observational follow-up study is designed to assess the long-term outcomes
      after VTE and to assess the effect of NOAC (rivaroxaban) on the prevalence of PTS. All
      patients diagnosed and treated for VTE at SØF from 01.01.2011 will be invited to participate
      in this study. Newly diagnosed patients will be recruited and followed-up according to the
      study schedule which is based on state of the art international guidelines.

      First follow-up will be performed at the end of treatment period, which is usually 3 or 6
      months after an event of VTE, or at one year if patients will be put on permanent AC.
      Thereafter, patients will be followed-up annually for at least 5 years or up to the end of
      the study, i.e for 10 years.

      The primary endpoints of the study are the development of PTS and CTEPH after VTE. There will
      be 3 visits: at 3 or 6 months depending on the duration of AC, at 2 and 5 years, in addition
      to a visit for TTE at 6 months. Remaining follow-ups will be performed by phone or by mail.
      All patients with PE will be examined by TTE 6 months after the diagnosis of PE. Those with
      signs of PAH will be referred for further work-up to establish the presence or absence of
      CTEPH at specialized centres. Patients with DVT will be evaluated for PTS at 2 and 5 years
      and for CTEPH if they develop dyspnoea. As for part b of the primary objective, the study
      will allow inclusion of patients with previous DVT diagnosed after 01.01.11.
