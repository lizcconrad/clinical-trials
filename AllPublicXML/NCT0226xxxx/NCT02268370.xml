  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how to increase the potential for achieving an
      &quot;operational cure&quot; from chronic myeloid leukemia. An &quot;operational cure&quot; is a state in which a
      person does not require further treatment, although there may be some remaining cancer cells.
      Patients would normally remain on a TK inhibitor indefinitely within a standard of care
      setting for chronic myeloid leukemia. Within this clinical trial, patients will discontinue
      their TK inhibitor prematurely. If any signs of progression are identified, dasatinib will be
      introduced.

      This research is being done because dasatinib has been shown to achieve a greater response in
      a much higher proportion of patients as compared to imatinib. Dasatinib is approximately 300
      times more potent than imatinib, and it is possible that a greater response can be achieved
      by dasatinib than by imatinib.

      This is an open label, single arm Phase II trial that will examine how safe and effective it
      will be for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to discontinued first line tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

      The main goal of this study is to determine the potential role of dasatinib (the study drug)
      in helping patients with CML attain a sustained treatment free remission.

      During this study the safety and tolerability of Dasatinib will be evaluated by means of drug
      related toxicity, adverse event reports, physical examinations and laboratory safety
      evaluations.

      The study period for an individual patient is expected to be approximately between 30-72
      months.

      A total of 135 patients will be recruited from 10 Canadian centres.

    <description>This research is being done because dasatinib has been shown to achieve a deep molecular response in patients as compared to imatinib.
Patients in this study will continue to take their own supply of imatinib for three months to ensure they have achieved a stable response to the drug. Once this has been confirmed, imatinib will be stopped and the patients in this study will then be monitored to see if their CML relapses. This period can last up to 2.5 years.
If the participant has a relapse, they will be started on dasatinib and will continue to receive dasatinib for up to 2 years.
If after one year they achieve a response, they will continue on dasatinib for one more year. If the participant maintains this response, they will have the option of discontinuing dasatinib.</description>
