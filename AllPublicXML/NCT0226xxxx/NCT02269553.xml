    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized, two treatment parallel,
      comparison study of the TMJ NextGeneration(TM) and custom-fit occlusal splint in the
      reduction of nocturnal bruxism episodes and monthly migraine episodes in subjects diagnosed
      with sleep bruxism and headaches.

      The study will be conducted at multiple study centers in the U.S. The study will consist of a
      screening period lasting up to 5 weeks and a treatment period lasting 8 weeks. Subjects will
      visit the dental clinic twice during the screening period, at Day 1, and at Weeks 4 and 8 of
      the study.The study will include a single-center run-in phase during which 12 subjects will
      be enrolled in order to gain preliminary effectiveness data on the TMJ NextGeneration(TM)
      device. Following completion of the first 12 subjects, a sample size re-estimation may be
      conducted in order to verify the initial sample size assumptions of the study. These run-in
      subjects will not be included in the final analysis of the study. Approximately a total of
      153 subjects will be enrolled in the study with subjects allocated 2:1 to the TMJ
      NextGeneration(TM) and occlusal splint treatment arms, respectively. The study is powered
      with respect to the dual primary effectiveness endpoints of CFB in bruxism episodes per hour
      of sleep and CFB in migraine episodes per month.

    <description>The TMJ NextGeneration(TM) device consists of a pair of small, hollow ear inserts. These ear inserts are custom-fit to each subject's ear canals. They are constructed from methacrylate polymers - the same material as has been used in hearing aids. The devices rest in the outer third of the ear canal and have a small retraction post that allows for removal of the device from the ear. The devices conform to the shape of the individuals' ear canals when the jaw is in the open position and permit full passage of sound into each ear. The device is FDA cleared under a 510(k) with an indication of reducing TMD pain.</description>

    <description>The occlusal splint to be used in this study will be a hard, full-arch splint with at least one occlusal contact on each tooth of the opposing arch. Each patient assigned to the occlusal splint treatment group may wear either maxillary or mandibular splints or both, as prescribed by the subject's dentist, during the study. All occlusal splints used in the study will be custom fit to each patient using standard dental processes. All occlusal splints used in the study will be manufactured by Paul O'Neill Dental Lab, Yucaipa , CA, USA using clear ADA approved orthodontic acrylic</description>
