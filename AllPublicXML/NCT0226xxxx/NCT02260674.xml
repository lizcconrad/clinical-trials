  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-54861911 during 6 months of treatment in participants with early (predementia)
      alzheimer's disease (AD [degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious
      onset of dementia, impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills
      are followed by severe apraxias and a global loss of cognitive abilities]).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), parallel-group study. The
      study consists of 3 Parts; Screening Phase of 90 days, double-blind Treatment Phase of 6
      months and Follow-up Phase of 7 to 28 days following the last dose in Month 6. Eligible
      participants in the early (predementia) AD spectrum will be randomized to either Treatment
      group 1, 2 or placebo and participants who previously participated in study 54861911ALZ1005
      will be enrolled in this study and will receive the same treatment as in study
      54861911ALZ1005. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 10 months.
      Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected to evaluate the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54861911, as well as amyloid beta fragments. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      cognitive measures.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; lifethreatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <measure>Relationship Between Dose and Exposure of JNJ-54861911 With Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma and, if possible, CSF measurements will be taken to measure the concentration of JNJ-54861911. Population pharmacokinetic modeling (statistical modeling) will be used to derive individual pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. Cmax, AUCtau, Tmax) in plasma and, if possible, in CSF. Incidence of adverse events and their timing of onset will be examined with regard to these concentrations to assess potential relationships between safety and exposure.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Amyloid Beta (ABeta) (1-37, 1-38, 1-40, 1-42) Levels and Soluble Amyloid Precursor Protein (sAPP) Fragments (sAPP-alpha, sAPP-beta), Total sAPP Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CSF samples will be obtained for measuring levels of different ABeta fragments such as ABeta 1-37, ABeta 1-38, ABeta 1-40, ABeta 1-42. ABeta fragments of different length are produced by cleavage of the APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and the gamma-secretase complex in the brain and excreted into CSF. For participants, who participated previously in study 54861911ALZ1005, the baseline CSF sample taken during that study may be used as baseline in this study.</description>

    <description>Plasma samples will be obtained for measuring levels of different ABeta fragments such as ABeta 1-37, ABeta 1-38, ABeta 1-40, ABeta 1-42. ABeta fragments of different length are produced by cleavage of the APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and the gamma-secretase complex in the different peripheral tissues, including white blood cells and can be measured in Plasma.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 1 up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>ABeta species and sAPP fragments in plasma and CSF will be measured.
