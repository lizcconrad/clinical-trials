      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and therapeutic equivalence of a generic
      tazarotene foam 0.1% and the reference listed Fabior™ (tazarotene foam, 0.1%) in the
      treatment of acne vulgaris.

    <textblock>
      Although topical retinoids have been individually used to successfully treat acne vulgaris,
      Fabior™ (Tazarotene) Foam, 0.1% is a safe and effective topical therapy used for the
      treatment of acne vulgaris. Actavis has developed a generic formulation of Tazarotene Foam,
      0.1%, and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this
      formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy male or nonpregnant female aged ≥ 12 and ≤ 40 years with a clinical diagnosis of
        acne vulgaris.

        Informed Consent/Assent: Subjects ages 12 to 17 years inclusive must have provided IRB
        approved written assent; this written assent must be accompanied by an IRB approved written
        informed consent from the Subject's legally acceptable representative (i.e., parent or
        guardian). In addition, all Subjects or their legally acceptable representatives (i.e.,
        parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA authorization.

        Subjects must have a minimum ≥ 30 non-inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed
        comedones) AND ≥ 25 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) AND no cystic lesions
        and only up to 1 facial nodular lesion (less than or equal to 5 mm) on the face. For the
        purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the facial
        treatment area excluding the eyes, the lips, and angles of the nose (i.e. the lines around
        the nostrils and under the nostrils) and all mucus membranes. Subjects may have acne
        lesions on other areas of the body which will also be excluded from the count, treatment,
        and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) evaluation (e.g., on the back, chest and
        arms).

        Subjects must have a severity grade 3, or 4 as per the Investigator's Global Assessment
        (IGA) (Section 6.2).

        Subjects must be willing to refrain from using all other topical acne medications or
        antibiotics during the 12-week treatment period for acne vulgaris, other than the
        Investigational Product.

        Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or
        postmenopausal for at least 1 year), must have a negative urine pregnancy test (with
        sensitivity down to at least 50mIU/ml hCG) within 2 weeks prior to baseline.

        Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or
        postmenopausal for at least 1 year), must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth
        control from the day of the first dose administration.. For the purpose of this study the
        following are considered acceptable methods of birth control: oral or injectable
        contraceptives, contraceptive patches, Depo-Provera® (stabilized for at least 3 months);
        NuvaRing® (vaginal contraceptive); Implanon™ (contraceptive implant) double barrier methods
        (e.g. condom and spermicide); IUD, or abstinence with a 2nd acceptable method of birth
        control should the Subject become sexually active. A sterile sexual partner is NOT
        considered an adequate form of birth control.

        All male Subjects must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their partners,
        from the day of the first dose administration. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth
        control for males.

        Subjects must be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the
        protocol, including attendance at the required study visits.

        Subjects who use make-up must have used the same brands/types of make-up for a minimum
        period of 14 days prior to study entry and must agree to not change make-up brand/type or
        frequency of use throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Female Subjects who are pregnant, nursing or planning to become pregnant during study
        participation.

        Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity or allergy to tazarotene and its excipients,
        and/or any of the study medication ingredients.

        Subjects with the presence of any skin condition that would interfere with the diagnosis or
        assessment of acne vulgaris. Such conditions include, but are not limited to the following:
        auto immune disease, rosacea; seborrheic dermatitis; perioral dermatitis;
        corticosteroid-induced acne; carcinoid syndrome; mastocytosis; acneform eruptions caused by
        make-up, medication, facial psoriasis and facial eczema, squamous cell carcinoma, steroid
        folliculitis, or bacterial folliculitis).

        drug induced acne) will be excluded from participation.

        Subjects with excessive facial hair (e.g. beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.) that would
        interfere with diagnosis or assessment of acne vulgaris.
