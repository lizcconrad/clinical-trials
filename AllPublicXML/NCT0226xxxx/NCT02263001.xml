  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries resulting in pain are one of the most common reasons for disability
      and missed duty among military personnel. Additionally, these injuries may create impairment
      in the area of optimal function, sleep and mood that may not be completely resolved with
      currently available therapies. This scenario creates the setting for testing and
      incorporation of additional treatment options to potentially improve care outcomes. Recent
      investigations have examined the adjunctive use of auricular therapy, which utilizes various
      interventions, typically needle-based, to stimulate the ear. This intervention appears to
      modulate the autonomic nervous system to produce more rapid onset of pain relief and
      reduction in pain related co-morbidities. For this trial of adjunctive auricular therapy,
      active duty personnel presenting with an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury triaged to
      outpatient care for treatment will be studied. Subjects randomized to auricular treatment
      will receive, in addition to standard care, up to 12 treatments over a maximum of 3 months
      from a clinician trained in auricular therapy. This trial will specifically examine whether
      the addition of a specific auricular therapy protocol to standard care will have a beneficial
      impact on the pain and functionality of military personnel who sustain an acute or sub-acute
      musculoskeletal injury.

      subjects will be enrolled at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. Subjects will be active duty
      personnel aged 18-60 years old presenting with an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury
      triaged to outpatient care for treatment. Subjects randomized to auricular treatment will
      receive, in addition to standard care, up to 12 treatments over a maximum of 3 months from a
