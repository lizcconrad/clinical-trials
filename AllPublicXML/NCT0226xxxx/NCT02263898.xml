      This phase II trial studies intermittent dosing of BRAF inhibitor LGX818 (encorafenib) and
      MEK inhibitor MEK 162 (binimetinib) in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to
      other parts of the body (metastatic) and have a BRAF V600 mutation. LGX818 and MEK162 may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking different enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      LGX818 and MEK162 with breaks between each course (intermittently) may help delay the time
      when tumors become resistant to the drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. One year progression free survival (PFS) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain biopsy samples from patients treated with an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and
      MEK162 to study adaptive and acquired resistance as well as melanoma evolutionary patterns.

      II. Study molecular changes of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance to LGX818 and
      MEK162 in circulating melanoma cells.

      III. Study plasma samples for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), microribonucleic acid
      (microRNA) and protein signatures of adaptive resistance and acquired resistance.

      IV. Explore the median progression free survival and overall survival of patients receiving
      an intermittent schedule of LGX818 and MEK162.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive LGX818 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and MEK162 PO twice daily (BID)
      continuously for 8 weeks, followed by intermittent dosing in subsequent cycles (3 weeks off
      therapy, 5 weeks on therapy). Cycles repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.

                  barrier method of contraception

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 8 weeks after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men

          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the
