  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with increased risk of ventricular
      arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Development of simple, noninvasive, reliable
      tools to measure sympathetic outflow in human subjects is therefore highly desirable.

      Microneurography is the current gold standard measurement technique, whereby multiunit
      postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity is recorded with tungsten ultrafine microelectrodes
      inserted selectively into nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerve. Though this technique is
      considered extremely safe, and has been used successfully for decades in human translational
      physiology experiments, it has not been adopted for routine clinical assessment due to the
      requirement for sophisticated equipment and specific technical training and skills.
      Alternatively, many have adopted heart rate variability as a simple, noninvasive technique
      for assessing sympathetic nerve activity. However, heart rate variability does not directly
      measure sympathetic nerve activity, and there is much debate in the literature as to the
      exact source of sympathetic nerve traffic. For example, many believe it is an accurate
      reflection of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, but does not accurately reflect changes in
      muscle or skin sympathetic nerve activity.

      To address these limitations, the investigators have developed a simple, noninvasive
      technique to measure sympathetic nerve activity using surface electrodes.

      Despite its great promise, this new approach has not yet been directly validated. The purpose
      of this study is therefore to validate this new technique (refered to as EKG-NA) against the
      current gold standard measurement technique, microneurography.
