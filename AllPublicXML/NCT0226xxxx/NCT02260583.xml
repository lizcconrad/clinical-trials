  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is common in stable COPD patients in a terminal phase
      of their disease In an attempt to correct or slow down the rate of rise of PaCO2, long-term
      noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has been proposed.

      Only very few studies demonstrated the clinical efficacy of NIV. Indeed this technique is not
      always well tolerated and therefore it may be effective only in a subset of patients The aim
      of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of &quot;one shot&quot; extrcorporeal CO2 removal
      device, in reducing the PaCO2 level

      Only very few studies demonstrated the clinical efficacy of NIV. Indeed this technique is not
      always well tolerated and therefore it may be effective only in a subset of patients Recently
      extracorporeal CO2 removal have been shown to avoid the need of endotracheal intubation in
      COPD patients with an episode of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure In this pilot
      physiological study we want to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique in reducing
      the PaCO2 level in those COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure non
      responding to chronic NIV.

    <description>the patients will be enroll to start a &quot;one shot&quot; session of extracorporeal CO2 removal. The patient will be connected to the device via a double lumen catheter inserted in the femoral vein An ECCO2R device based on a modified continuous venovenous hemofiltration system will be used. Blood flow is driven by a roller nonocclusive pump (0-450 mL/min) through a polypropylene oxygenator ; priming volume, 100 mL; contact surface area, 1.35 m2; maximum blood flow rate, 7 L/min) that is connected to a fresh gas flow source delivering 100% oxygen at a constant rate of 8 L/min. Exiting the oxygenator, blood is driven to a hemofilter.</description>
