      A MULTI-CENTER, PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY TO EVALUATE PHYSICIAN PREFERENCE
      RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SURGIQUEST AIRSEAL INSUFFLATION SYSTEM (AIS) VS. CONVENTIONAL
      INSUFFLATION SYSTEMS (CIS) FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PNEUMOPERITONEUM DURING ROBOTIC PARTIAL

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center clinical Study designed to evaluate
      Physician Preference related to the use of the SurgiQuest AirSealTM Insufflation System (AIS)
      vs. Conventional Insufflation Systems (CIS) for the Management of pneumoperitoneum during
      Robotic Partial Nephrectomy. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 treatment device to
      control ratio into one of three (3) different study arms: 1) AIS @ 12mmHg pressure, 2) AIS @
      15mmHg pressure, and 3) CIS @ 15mmHg pressure. 189 randomized subjects distributed in three
      arms of 63 patients. The three study sites are targeted to enroll 63 patients each, 21
      patients in each of the three (3) study arms. It is expected that this will take up to 6
      months.
