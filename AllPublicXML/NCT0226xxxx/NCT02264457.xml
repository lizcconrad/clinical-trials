  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During cataract surgery an artificial lens is implanted in the eye. These artificial lenses
      are called intraocular lenses (IOLs) and there are many different types of IOL designs. Your
      eyes have astigmatism, which is a normal and common characteristic of the eye. If left
      uncorrected the astigmatism would mean that you would need to wear spectacles for viewing
      distance objects. New IOL designs called toric IOLs help to correct the astigmatism to
      improve your vision after cataract surgery. This study has been designed to look at how well
      a toric IOL corrects this astigmatism so that you do not need to wear spectacles for viewing
      distance objects. There are many designs of these toric IOLs and for this study we are
      looking to compare two different designs of toric IOLs by putting one lens in your right eye
      and a different type of lens in your left eye. Both lenses are commercially available and are
      commonly implanted IOLs. Using new non-invasive methods we hope to be able to better judge
      the visual performance of these lenses and the ability of these lenses to correct
      astigmatism. In addition the study will involve imaging and examining the IOLs to determine
      the prevalence of any post-operative complications.
