      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Northern hemisphere
      2013-2014 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in 60 healthy infants aged 6-35
      months old, 60 healthy adults aged 18-60 years old, and 60 healthy seniors aged &gt; 60 years.

    <measure>The immunogenicity of 2013-2014 seasonal trivalent vaccine (TIV) in adults and seniors</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the immune responses to each antigen of the 2013-2014 seasonal TIV in adults and seniors by detection of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The incidences of adverse events (AEs) in infants, adults and seniors</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - day 35</time_frame>
    <description>After each injection, a 30-minute safety observation was conducted immediately, and the body temperature, occurrence of solicited local and general AEs within 72 hours were collected. Unsolicited AEs of adults and seniors were collected until day 21, and those of infants were collected until day 35. Each AE case was reviewed by the investigator to determine whether or not it was an adverse reaction (related to the vaccination).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The cross-reactivity of 2013-2014 seasonal TIV in adults and seniors against influenza B Victoria lineage virus and the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the cross-reactivity of 2013-2014 seasonal TIV in adults and seniors against influenza B Victoria lineage virus (not in the vaccine formulation) and the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by detection of HI antibody titer</description>
