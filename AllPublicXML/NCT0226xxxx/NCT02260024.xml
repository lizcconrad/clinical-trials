  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to estimate the magnitude of the error in the
      prediction of in vivo bioavailability (AUC0-30,Cmax) by means of in vitro dissolution data
      applying the methods of IVIVC. The secondary objective of the study was to investigate
      whether the intake of food 30 minutes prior to drug administration affects the systemic
      exposure of pramipexole SR C2 or not
