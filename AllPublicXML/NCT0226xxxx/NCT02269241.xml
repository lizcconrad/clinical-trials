      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-controlled trial in female
      subjects, including adolescents between the ages of 15+(inclusive) who present to the clinic
      seeking contraception, who are postmenarcheal and premenopausal.

      At screening, informed consent will be obtained and the screening procedures will be
      performed. After confirmation of the subject's eligibility, the subject will be provided with
      the investigational product and trained in the use of an electronic diary. Afterwards, the
      subjects will attend visit the clinical site on Day 20±2 of the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th cycles
      and on Day 29+2 of the 13th cycle. The last clinical site visit will occur 10-14 days after
      the 13th cycle visit.

      The trial will include women who have never used hormonal contraceptives before consent
      (naïve users), women who have not used hormonal contraceptives in the past three months
      before consent or who have used hormonal contraceptives in the past but have a
      contraceptive-free time of less than three months before consent (previous users) as well as
      women directly switching from another hormonal method (switchers). Women who have used
      hormonal contraceptives in the past but have a contraceptive-free time of less than three
      months before consent are allowed to be included into the trial if they had at least one
      complete menstrual cycle before enrollment.

      A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis planned in the whole subject population, will
      obtain sparse blood samples to determine plasma concentrations. In total, four blood samples
      will be collected: two samples each will be collected during the 1st cycle and during the 6th
      cycle of treatment.

      Adverse events and safety information will be collected throughout the study.
