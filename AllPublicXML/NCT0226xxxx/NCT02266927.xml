        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects' ages 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at screening.

          2. Have a body mass index of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and a body weight of not less
             than 52 kg for males and 45 kg for females.

          3. Otherwise healthy mild to moderate asthmatic (Part 2) with no clinically relevant
             abnormalities in the opinion of the Investigator as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, blood chemistry, hematology (including complete blood count),
             serology, urinalysis, vital signs, and ECG performed at screening.

          4. History of mild to moderate asthma, diagnosed by a physician, which is well controlled
             at the present time (no history of sudden or severe asthma exacerbation in the past 12
             months).

          5. Are unlikely to exacerbate during the study due to seasonal allergen exposure.

          6. Able to tolerate withdrawal of their medication for a required period of time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently have or have a history of disease or dysfunction of the cardiovascular,
             endocrine, hematologic, neurological, immune, gastrointestinal, genitourinary,
             musculoskeletal, or other body system that is clinically significant in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

          2. History of smoking or use of nicotine-containing substances within the previous 3
             months before screening.

          3. Hypersensitivity to fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients found in
             OPTINOSETM FLUTICASONE or Flovent® HFA (for Part 2).

          4. History of extensive nasal and/or sinus surgery.

          5. Known nasal obstruction including allergic rhinitis, nasal septal deviations,
             polyposis, severe mucosal swelling, nasal ulcers, nasal trauma or any other reason.

          6. History of acute severe asthma attacks.

          7. History of seasonal asthma exacerbation, in which case subjects should be outside the
             relevant allergen season.

          8. Have evidence of any chronic medical conditions other than asthma requiring
             prescription medications (e.g., hypertension or diabetes).

          9. Have used inhaled, intranasal, oral, or injectable corticosteroids within 4 weeks
             prior to dosing. Subjects should be on stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to
             withdrawal.
