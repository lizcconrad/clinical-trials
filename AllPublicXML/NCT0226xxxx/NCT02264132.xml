    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to investigate relative BA at steady state and to
      investigate dose proportionality of pharmacokinetic parameters

      Relative BA at steady state:

        -  Pramipexole 0.375 mg ER tablet q.d. versus pramipexole 0.125 mg IR tablet t.i.d.

        -  Pramipexole 1.5 mg ER tablet q.d. versus pramipexole 0.5 mg IR tablet t.i.d.

      Dose proportionality of pharmacokinetic parameters:

      · Pramipexole ER dosages from 0.375 to 1.5 mg q.d.
