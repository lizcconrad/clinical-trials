      current regimen (Arm 2) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is virologic failure defined as

      DESIGN HIV-1 infected subjects with CD4 nadir &gt; 200 cells/mm3, no history of virologic
      failure and plasma HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks while on any United States
      Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommended or alternative three-drug
      antiretroviral regimen will be randomized to dolutegravir (DTG) plus lamivudine (Arm 1) or
      continuation of their current regimen (Arm 2) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is virologic
      failure defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL before or at Week 24

      All subjects will undergo routine monitoring including plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4/CD8 count,
      hematology, chemistry and fasting lipids. Resistance testing will be done in all patients who
      experience virologic failure. Single-copy HIV-1 assay will be done to quantify residual
      viremia.

      DURATION 48 weeks

      SAMPLE SIZE 90 subjects

      POPULATION HIV-1-infected men and women, 18 years and older, with CD4 nadir &gt; 200 cells/mm3,
      no baseline resistance, no history of virologic failure, and HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL for at
      least 48 weeks prior to study entry while on any DHHS recommended or alternative three-drug
      regimen

      REGIMEN Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to:

      Arm 1: dolutegravir 50 mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily OR Arm 2: Continue current DHHS
      recommended or alternative three-drug antiretroviral regimen

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 Infection

          -  HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL on all measurements within 48 weeks prior to study entry while
             on any DHHS recommended or alternative three-drug antiretroviral regimen. (A history
             of switching for simplification and/or tolerability is allowed. At least two
             measurements within the previous 48 weeks are required prior to study screening.)

          -  No history of virologic failure, defined as consecutive HIV RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL after
             12 months of initiating ART. An isolated (non-consecutive) HIV RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL (but
             less than 400 copies/mL) is permitted after 12 months of initiating ART but not in the
             48-week window prior to study entry.

          -  Screening plasma HIV RNA &lt; 20 copies/mL using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1

          -  Nadir CD4 count &gt;200 cells/mm

          -  Pretreatment genotype documenting no mutations in the protease or reverse
             transcriptase genes

          -  No known resistance to integrase inhibitors

          -  Laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry:

        mL/min

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test

          -  Men and women age greater or equal to 18 years.

          -  Ability to continue current regimen (i.e, have uninterrupted access)

          -  No evidence of chronic hepatitis B

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious illness or AIDS-related complication within 21 days of screening requiring
             systemic treatment and/or hospitalization

          -  Treatment within 30 days prior to study entry with immune modulators

          -  Vaccination within 7 days

          -  Active HCV treatment or anticipated need for treatment within study period. (HCV
             infection alone is not exclusionary)

          -  Unstable liver disease or severe hepatic impairment

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to DTG or lamivudine.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that could interfere with adherence to study
             requirements

          -  ALT (alanine aminotransferase) &gt;5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) OR ALT &gt;3 x ULN and
             total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN (with 35% direct bilirubin)
