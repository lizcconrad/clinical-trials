      This study will investigate the impact of music therapy on newly diagnosed patients with
      cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Measurements used at baseline, middle and end of first cycle
      will be the Resiliency Scale (Wagnild and Young 1993); The HADS scale (hospital anxiety
      depression scale, Zigmond and Snaith 1983 )and and The CAS scale for pain (Color Analysis
      Scale).

      The purpose of this research study is to examine clinical music therapy's impact on the
      resiliency of adults undergoing infusion therapy. This research study is being undertaken to
      learn about how creative music therapy modalities can affect the infusion therapy process.
      Infusion therapy often includes side effects which impact quality of life. Symptoms include
      pain, nausea and anxiety. For newly diagnosed patients anxiety accompanies adjustment to
      scheduling treatments and side effects. Typically patients receiving infusion therapy have no
      alternative focus for their mind and or body aside from the Infusion itself. Since the
      relationship between pain and anxiety is inter-related, altering one modality through a live
      music intervention may modify the impact of the other modality thus shifting the cycle and
      overall impact of pain and anxiety providing relief which leads to self soothing control
      measures. The current research will enroll patients newly diagnosed with either Lung, Breast,
      or Gastrointestinal Cancer that are treated in the Infusion Suite of SLRHC. 100 patients will
      be randomly assigned to three groups: clinical instrumental improvisation, clinical vocal
      improvisation or control. All enrolled participants will complete a survey which indicates
      their music preference, Resiliency Test , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Body Pain Scale - Color Analysis Scale (CAS).

A continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, includes 5 levels of stress/pain (0,2,4,6,8,10), anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme (no stress to worst possible stress).Tthe patient indicates the degree of stress he/she experiences by choosing one of the 5 levels on the scale. Respondents are asked to report &quot;current&quot; pain/stress intensity or &quot;in the last 24 hours.&quot;</description>
