  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention group will be exercising one hour twice a week for 12 weeks. The
      participants will be doing intensive strength exercises and challenging balance exercises in
      groups of 4-6. Two physical therapists will be leading the intervention group. The control
      group will be meeting at the same frequency. Groups of 4-6 will be lead by an occupational
      therapist. The participants will be doing relaxation exercises, listen to music and social
      activities such as board games or indoor bowling.

      The investigators will carry out three test periods:

        -  Baseline testing before intervention start

        -  Post test after 12 weeks of intervention

        -  Follow-up 12 weeks after post test.

      The testing will comprise:

        -  Physical tests carried out by physiotherapists

        -  Questionnaires concerning mental health and ADL (activities of daily living)

        -  Cognition tests

        -  Cortisol in saliva
