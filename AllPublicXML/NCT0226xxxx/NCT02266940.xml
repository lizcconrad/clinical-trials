    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, 3 treatment, 3 period crossover study. This study is
      designed to assess the relative bioavailability of DS 1971a from a tablet formulation and a
      reconstituted oral suspension and the effect of a high fat meal on the relative
      bioavailability of DS 1971a from the tablet formulation.

        Must be postmenopausal (the last menstrual period was at least 12 months before Screening,
        and a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test at Screening confirms postmenopausal status);

             Prevention System (TOPS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory
             values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or the safety of the
             subject

          -  Presence of or history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to)
             liver or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine,

             period

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the study, eg, as a blood

             medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly (for men) or 14 units of
             alcohol weekly (for women)
