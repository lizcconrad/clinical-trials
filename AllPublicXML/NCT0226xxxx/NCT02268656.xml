      Before anethetic induction, infuse dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg for 2 minutes and after
      injection of lidocaine 30 mg, propofol infusion by using target controlled infusion (TCI)
      pump. Effect site concentraion of propofol start from 5 and changes the concentration as
      previous response to i-gel insertion as up and down methods

      defined as difficulty to mouth open, severe nausea and couph and laryngeal spasm, and not
      loss of consciousness.
