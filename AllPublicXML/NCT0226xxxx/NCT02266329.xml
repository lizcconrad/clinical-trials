      The purpose of this study is to determine if prazosin is more effective than placebo in
      decreasing frequency, severity, disability, and other negative effects of headaches related
      to mild traumatic brain injury in Service Members and Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headaches following combat-related post-concussive injury are common, and in some patients
      can increase in frequency and severity to become very debilitating. Posttraumatic headaches
      (PTHAs), particularly those following blast-related head injury, can be resistant to standard
      headache therapies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      medication prazosin as a prophylactic (preventive) agent in treating combat-related PTHAs.
      Prazosin is a generic drug originally marketed over 30 years ago as a treatment for high
      blood pressure. It has subsequently been found to be safe and effective for treating other
      problems, including most recently posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and disrupted sleep in
      active duty Iraq/Afghanistan Service Members and Veterans. In preliminary studies, prazosin
      has also been found to substantially reduce the intensity and frequency of PTHAs in this
      population. This finding is the motivation behind this study.

      The investigators' hypotheses are (1) that prazosin will be more effective than placebo in
      easing the effects of chronic PTHAs, including headache frequency, duration, severity, use of
      abortive/analgesic medications, and disability caused, and (2) that improvement in headache
      parameters will be associated with improvement in sleep quality, PTSD symptom severity, mood,
      cognition, health-related quality of life, and global clinical status, and with moderation of
      alcohol consumption.

      The total trial length is 22 - 24 weeks. Following an initial clinic visit to determine
      preliminary study eligibility, there will be a 4-week pre-treatment preliminary screening
      period, during which participants will keep a daily headache diary. The purpose of this is to
      confirm eligibility for randomization per inclusion/exclusion criteria and to collect
      baseline data for headache-related outcome measures. Participants confirmed to be eligible to
      continue in the study will then have a one-week sleep evaluation including actigraphy and
      keeping a daily sleep diary. This will be followed by a baseline study visit, during which
      baseline data for secondary outcome measures will be collected using validated structured
      self-reports and clinician interviews. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to prazosin or
      placebo, and the study drug dose will be gradually titrated over a 5 to 7-week period to 5 mg
      in the morning and 20 mg in the evening or the maximum tolerated dose. The dose titration
      will be followed by 12 weeks at steady-dose. For the last week of the steady-dose phase,
      participants will repeat the sleep evaluation. Participants will keep a headache log through
      the duration of the study. Results will be analyzed using standard statistical techniques.

          -  Continuous headaches of any severity, i.e., persistent daily headaches with no
             headache-free period less than 8 hours between attacks

             intended to mitigate headache or other chronic pain must be stable for at least 4
             weeks prior to beginning the preliminary screening period and should be intended to be
             continued for the duration of the trial. Participants will be encouraged to defer
             enrolling in such activities until they have completed the treatment trial.

        Medication Exclusions:

          -  Current use of prazosin at a dose of &gt;2 mg or other alpha-1 antagonist for any purpose

          -  Use of prazosin at a dose of 2 mg or less is not excluded, however there will be a
             2-week wash-out period prior to beginning the baseline headache log-keeping period.

          -  Allergy or previous adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist

          -  Subjects must be on a stable dose of the following medications/treatments for at least
             4 weeks prior to the preliminary screening period, and must intend to continue the
             medication for the duration of the trial: psychoactive drugs, for example
             anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics;
             antihypertensive medications, including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,
             angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers; magnesium
             prescribed specifically for headache.

          -  Potential participants who have been taking trazodone will undergo a 2-week washout
             period before beginning the preliminary screening period. Because combining prazosin
             and trazodone may increase risk of priapism, trazodone is not allowed during the
             study.

          -  Sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil (Stendra)
             will not be permitted during the dose titration period, because of increased risk of
             hypotension in combination with alpha-1 blockers, but will be allowed at half the
             usual starting dose following the study drug dose titration period, per VA prescribing
             guidelines.

          -  Use of butalbital within 4 weeks of beginning the preliminary screening period through
             the end of study involvement.

          -  Use of supplements containing nitrates and supplements containing stimulants (such as
             ephedra) within 2 weeks of beginning the preliminary screening period through the end
             of study involvement.

          -  Use of prescribed stimulants (such as amphetamine or dextroamphetamine containing
             medications) within 2 weeks of beginning the preliminary screening period through the
             end of study involvement.
