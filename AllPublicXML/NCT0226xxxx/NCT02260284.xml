      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of acupuncture in treating chronic
      low-back pain

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We want to know if the Yaotong points penetration or standardized acupuncture mode are more
      effective than medical care alone for CLBP; and if Yaotong points penetration is more
      effective than standardized acupuncture.

    <measure>Changes from baseline on modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at 0 week, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This wellvalidated questionnaire assesses pain on several dimensions including sensory pain, affective pain, and evaluative pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on Diagnosis and Curative Effect Standard for Syndrome of TCM for CLBP at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at 0 week, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It includes curing standard, referring to LBP had disappeared and no difficulty in movement was found; effective standard, referring to the pain was relieved but slight discomfort was found; and ineffective standard, referring to no symptom improvement was found.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on short-form 36 health survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 0 week, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical and mental health component summary scores of the medical outcomes</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on Visual Analog Scale at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>at 0 week, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This rating scale involved the selection of a point along a 10-cm line, which described pain intensity on a continuum from &quot;no painat all&quot; to &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot; This scale has been found to be an excellent measure of self-reported pain</description>
