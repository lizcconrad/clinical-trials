      This study was performed to assess the efficacy of systemic lycopene (8 mgms Daily for two
      months) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in chronic periodontitis patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized double blinded clinical trial which was performed to assess the
      efficacy of systemic lycopene (8 mgms Daily for two months) as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planing in chronic periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome
      measures were Serum MDA, CRP and Hb1AC. The secondary outcomes were modified gingival
      index(GI), Probing pocket depth(PPD), and Clinical attachment level(CAL). All the outcomes
      were measured at baseline, 2 months and 6 months.

      The results were that the Lycopene with scaling and root planing group gave:

      Statistically significant results in reducing Mean serum MDA levels at 2 months and 6 months
      respectively.

    <description>This unique outcome measure was assessed from baseline to 6 months post treatment by spectrophotometric estimation of serum Thiobarbituric acid substances (TBARS). The TBARS Assay measures malondialdehyde (MDA), a reactive compound formed from lipid peroxides that are generated under conditions of oxidative stress. Oxidative modification of lipids occurs with aging and various diseases, and increased oxidative stress is associated with diabetes and its complications. MDA forms an adduct with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). Results are calculated from a standard curve constructed with authentic MDA.</description>
