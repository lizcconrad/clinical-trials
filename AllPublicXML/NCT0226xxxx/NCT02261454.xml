  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional postoperative care has been challenged recently to improve and speedup recovery
      (including the return of bowel function) such that patients can be discharged to home more
      quickly. This approach includes earlier mobilization of the patient, and introducing solid
      food sooner. Additionally, there is evidence in adults to suggest that &quot;sham feeding&quot; by
      chewing gum may also speed up bowel recovery so the patient may tolerate a solid diet
      earlier.

      The aim of this study is to determine if gum chewing can enhance bowel recovery in children
      who undergo abdominal surgery.

    <textblock>
      After intestinal surgery, many patients suffer from a &quot;postoperative ileus&quot; (POI). The cause
      is multifactorial and can be attributed to surgery itself, the lingering effect of the
      anesthetic, the use of narcotics and decreased mobility of the patient.

      An ileus can delay the time to full diet, thus lengthening the hospital stay of the patient -
      sometimes up to several weeks.

      There is evidence that early drinking/eating and increased mobility may accelerate the return
      of bowel function. &quot;Fast-tracking&quot; is well documented in the adult literature; protocols have
      been put in place to enhance GI tract recovery and thus decrease the morbidity of a prolonged
      hospital stay and ileus. &quot;Fast-tracking&quot; has been done in pediatric patients but not in a
      large RCT for abdominal surgery.
