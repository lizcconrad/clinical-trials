      This pilot clinical trial studies the Harvesting Health Program in improving the diet and
      physical activity level of cancer survivors. Nutrition and physical activity classes and the
      opportunity to harvest fruits, vegetables, and herbs may increase participants' fruit and
      vegetable consumption and physical activity levels. Studying the participation rates and
      changes in participants' eating and physical activity habits may help doctors learn whether
      the program has an effect on participant lifestyle.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure survivor participation in regards to each aspect of the Harvesting Health Program
      (personalized and group education, gardening and harvesting, and utilization of novel
      web-based technologies).

      II. Assess survivor preferences regarding key Harvesting Health Program components impacting
      participation (physical facilities, schedule and timing, education topics and sessions,
      garden access, web portal usability, etc.).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. A customized &quot;Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard&quot; has been developed and will be
      implemented to evaluate pre/post measures of diet and physical activity at baseline (month 0)
      and at months 6, 9 and 12.

      II. Participants are evaluated at baseline and at completion of the intervention for: (a)
      serum and body composition biomarkers of exposure and efficacy, and (b) health indices
      related to cancer survivorship and overall health.

      III. To assess Program sustainability, follow-up questionnaires will be completed at 9 and 12
      months using the Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard and questionnaires regarding quality
      of life outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo a series of 10 education and training sessions over 1 hour every 2
      weeks, comprising education on current research, evidence-based health guidelines,
      application techniques, reference materials specific to extended-stage cancer survivors, and
      recommendations and personal health goals for survivorship.

    <measure>Change in behavior, measured by Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecards</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis of no change in the overall scorecard value will be tested versus a two sided alternative using a paired T-test at alpha level 0.025 (Bonferroni corrected for 2 scorecards). Exploratory analyses may be completed to understand which components of these Scorecards are driving the improvement or degradation in scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in biomarker levels, assessed by values for the Health &amp; Wellness Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers include blood glucose, lipid panel (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides), skin antioxidant score and bone density. The hypothesis of no change in these markers will be tested using a multivariate Hotelling's T-squared test at the 0.05 level. If a significant difference is noted, then the individual scores will be further tested with paired t-tests to determine which are significantly different. The p-values of the individual t-tests will be adjusted via a Bonferroni correction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program sustainability, measured by change in questionnaire scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be completed using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) comparing scores for the Personal Health Assessment, Dietary Screener (VioScreen FFQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Short Form-12, and Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale using the scores from baseline, 6, 9 and 12 months post-study. Post-hoc analyses will include identification of the particular scores that improved and maintained the improvement post-study. Exploratory analyses may be completed to understand which components of these surveys are driving changes in scores.</description>
