    <textblock>
      KTx recipients receiving cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive therapy, and in the opinion of
      the investigator would benefit from switch to a tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, will
      switch the immunosuppressive therapy to a tacrolimus-based one. Efficacy and safety of
      patients will be observed for 52 weeks.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the adherence of kidney transplant
      recipients treated with Prograf and Advagraf regimens.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare the renal function (eGFR) in KTx recipients treated with Cyclosporine and
           Tacrolimus regimens.

        -  To compare the QoL of KTx recipients treated with Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus regimens.

        -  To compare the efficacy of Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus regimens in KTx recipients.

        -  To compare the safety of Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus regimens in KTx recipients.
