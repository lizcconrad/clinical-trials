  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as an independent risk
      factor for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and for high recurrence rates of atrial
      fibrillation after ablation therapy. We have previously shown that simulated OSA triggers
      premature atrial beats (PABs) by acute changes in intra-thoracic pressure. Most episodes of
      atrial fibrillation are initiated by PABs. However, the origin of PABs induced by
      intra-thoracic pressure swings is unknown. This study investigates the origin of premature
      atrial beats induced by intra-thoracic pressure changes that simulate obstructive sleep apnea
      in patients with atrial fibrillation.

    <description>The MM will be carried out during a elective standard pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The MM will be performed using an occluded mouthpiece with a small air leak to prevent complete closure of the glottis during inspiration and thus assure negative pressure throughout the entire airway. After expiration, inspiration with a target negative intrathoracic pressure of -40mmHg will be carried out against the mouthpiece.</description>
