      Male and female DoD beneficiaries ages 18 years or older, who are referred for a standard of
      care weight loss intervention for treatment of obesity will be recruited. Subjects will be
      randomized into one of two groups receiving either a standard of care weight loss
      intervention plus auricular acupuncture at Shen Men, Point Zero, and Appetite Control
      Point/Hunger Point or receiving a standard of care weight loss intervention plus sham
      auricular acupuncture. Subjects will receive treatment in accordance with their randomization
      group for 12 weeks then have one additional follow up visit at week 24. The following
      measures will be obtained: height, weight, waist circumference, and Body Mass Index will be
      calculated.

      of standard of care weight loss intervention, current email address, height (in inches),
      weight (in pounds), waist circumference (in inches) measurement, previous bariatric surgery,
      and body mass index calculated.

      Visit 1-Week 1: (1st week of standard of care weight intervention)

      Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups and treated:

        -  Group 1: Standard of care weight loss intervention plus auricular acupuncture at Shen
           Men, Point Zero, and Appetite Control Point/Hunger Point in each ear. The 3 needles will
           remain in each ear for 15 minutes.

        -  Group 2: Standard of care weight loss intervention plus sham acupuncture at three
           nonacupoints in each ear. The 3 needles will remain in each ear for 15 minutes.

      All subjects, regardless of randomization group, will be instructed to have no heavy meals,
      no excessive hot or cold foods, no heavy exercise or intercourse, and no alcohol for 24 hours
      after this visit.

      Visit 2-12 (Week 2-12 of standard of care weight intervention):

      Subjects will be given treatment according to their randomization group. The acupuncture
      needles will be applied and remain in each ear for 15 minutes.

      Record: weight, waist circumference measurement, and document compliance for standard of care
      weight loss intervention (i.e. attendance and measurements from class).

      All subjects, regardless of randomization group, will be instructed to have no heavy meals,
      no excessive hot or cold foods, no heavy exercise or intercourse, and no alcohol for 24 hours

      Record: weight, and waist circumference measurement.

      Subjects will be asked the following questions:

        -  Do you follow a regular routine of physical exercise? Yes/No *If yes, what type of
           exercise (mark all that apply):
