      Newly admitted patients will be screened for risk of malnutrition. Patients will receive
      either the feeding protocol or current oral nutrition supplement (ONS) practice, pending
      location. Patients will continue the nutrition plan taking the supplement post discharge.
      Study team will follow-up with telephone calls to help support post-discharge ONS compliance.
      Quality and service utilization data will be gathered for analysis.
