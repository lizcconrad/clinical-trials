      This is an investigator sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) aimed to assess the
      use of the Custom Made Device (CMD) to repair juxtarenal aneurysms, suprarenal and type IV
      thoracoabdominal aneurysms in standard risk patients having appropriate anatomy. This study
      is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm study.

    <description>The CMD that will be used in this IDE is structurally the same as the commercially available Zenith Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft, except as noted below.
In general, the Zenith® Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft is a modular system constructed of full- thickness woven polyster fabric sewn to self-expanding stainless steel z-stents with braided polyster and monofilament polypropylene sutures. In this study, fenestrated grafts with usually up to 4 fenestrations may be used. Only in rare situations in which large accessory renal arteries or separate visceral arteries may exist, the device may include more than 4 fenestrations to accommodate these additional vessels.
Device implantation will be performed using standardized endosvacular techniques used in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient is deemed suitable for inclusion in the study if the patient has at least
             one the following:

               1. Juxtarenal or suprarenal AAA and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms with
                  diameter ≥5.0 cm in diameter or 2 times the normal aortic diameter;

               2. Aneurysm with history of growth ≥0.5 cm/year;

               3. Saccular aneurysm with aortic diameter greater than 1.5 times the normal aortic
                  diameter that is deemed to be at risk for rupture based upon physician
                  interpretation.

               4. Patients that are not eligible for treatment with commercially available
                  endografts.

        General Exclusion Criteria

        A patient must be excluded from the clinical investigation if any of the following are
        true:

          1. Age &lt;18 years;

          2. Life expectancy &lt;2 years;

          3. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning on becoming pregnant within 60 months;

          4. Inability or refusal to give informed consent by the patient or a legally authorized
             representative;

          5. Unwilling or unable to comply with the follow-up schedule;

          6. Prior surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of the anticipated date of
             the fenestrated procedure, with the exception of planned staged procedures to provide
             access for repair (e.g. staged iliac conduit, thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm
             repair for proximal aneurysms), to facilitate the procedure by allowing open
             reparation of a target artery not amenable to revascularization with the
             investigational device, such us an internal iliac artery, subclavian artery or
             visceral artery with early bifurcation, tortuosity or occlusive disease preventing
             successful placement and alignment side stents, or to treat proximal aortic aneurysms.

          7. Participation in another clinical or device trial, with the exception of observational
             studies or participation in another investigational endovascular endograft protocol or
             percutaneous aortic valve protocol, not encompassed by the IDE protocol (&gt;30 days).

          8. Patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm requiring urgent or emergent repair.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical Exclusion Criteria

        Patients must be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions are true:

          1. Known sensitivities or allergies to stainless steel, nitinol, polyester, solder (tin,
             silver), polypropylene, urethane or gold

          2. History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately pre-
             medicated

          3. Leaking or ruptured aneurysm associated with hypotension

          4. Uncorrectable coagulopathy

          5. Mycotic aneurysm or patients with evidence of active systemic infection.

          6. History of connective tissue disorder (e.g. vascular Ehlers Danlos, Marfan's
             syndrome), with the exception of those patients who had prior open surgical aortic
             replacement or endovascular repair, where a surgical graft or an endograft would serve
             as landing zone for the investigational endograft.

          7. Body habitus that would inhibit x-ray visualization of the aorta and its branches.

        Anatomical Exclusion Criteria

        Patient must be excluded from the study if any of the following is true:

          1. Inadequate femoral or iliac access compatible with the requirements of the required
             delivery system.

          2. Type I, II or III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, with the exception of those
             patients who had prior open surgical aortic replacement or endovascular repair, where
             a surgical graft or an endograft has been extended proximal and near the celiac artery
             (functional type IV) that would serve as landing zone for the investigational
             endograft.

          3. Inability to perform a temporary or permanent open surgical or endovascular iliac
             conduit for patients with inadequate femoral/iliac access.

          4. Absence of a landing aortic segment in the distal thoracic aorta above the
             diaphragmatic hiatus with:

               -  A diameter measured outer to the outer wall greater than 38 mm or less than 19
                  mm;

               -  Parallel aortic wall with &gt;20% diameter change and with significant calcification
                  and/or thrombus in the selected area of the seal zone.

          5. Visceral anatomy not compatible with the CMD due to excessive occlusive disease or
             small size not amenable to stent graft placement.

          6. Unsuitable distal iliac arterial fixation site and anatomy:

               -  Common iliac artery fixation site diameter, measured outer wall to outer wall on

               -  Iliac artery diameter, measured outer wall to outer wall on a sectional image
                  (CT) &gt; 21 mm at distal fixation site, with inability to perform open internal
                  iliac artery revascularization or iliac branch stent graft or custom iliac
                  extension with fenestration.

               -  Iliac artery distal fixation site &lt;10 mm in length.

               -  Inability to preserve at least one hypogastric artery.
