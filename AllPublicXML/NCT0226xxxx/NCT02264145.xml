  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine the effect of the ethanolic solutions inhaled from the
      Metered dose inhaler (MDI) (15.5 mg, 31.2 mg and 62.4 mg of ethanol) and from Respimat® (18.4
      of ethanol) on the breath alcohol measurements in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary aim is to determine the linear dose-effect for the HFA 134a-MDI doses. An open,
      randomized, four-way-cross-over design is chosen. The randomization is balanced and
      stratified in accordance with predicted values of the volunteers of Total Lung Capacity (TLC)

          -  No clinically significant abnormal conditions at the screening visit. A clinically
             significant disease is defined as one, which in the opinion of the investigator, may
             either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or a disease
             which may influence the results of the study or the subjects ability to participate in
             the study

             weeks to screening. This is to insure no reduced alcohol absorption by mucus

          -  Previous inclusion in the randomized period of this study
