  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop sensitive and objective clinical research
      tools for the assessment of trunk motor control. In order to accomplish this goal, the
      investigators aim to quantify changes in trunk motor control before and after spinal
      manipulation treatment. The investigators hypothesize that trunk motor control will improve
      in the low back pain participants after 4-weeks of spinal manipulation treatment.
      Additionally, the investigators will compare position and force trunk motor control between
      healthy controls and low back pain patients. The investigators hypothesize that baseline
      tests of position and force trunk motor control will be better in healthy individuals than
      low back pain patients.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4 and from week 4 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be in a seated position during the position tracking task and will wear a chest harness with an attached position sensor. The angular position of the trunk will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by moving their trunk. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between the target position signal and the actual trunk position (measured in degrees with string potentiometers).</description>

    <description>Participants will be in a seated position and will be asked to generate force with their trunk against a fixed pad. The pad will be attached to a load cell that monitors how much force is being generated by their trunk. The force level will be displayed on a monitor 1 meter in front of the participants and they will be asked to follow a moving target by generating force with their trunk. Accuracy will be determined by taking the difference between target force signal and the actual trunk force (measured in Newtons with the load cell).</description>

    <description>Participants will be sitting in a seat mounted to a robotic platform (Mikrolar Hexapod Robot) and will wear a chest harness with an attached position sensor. The robotic platform will provide an angular perturbation to the participant about the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane while the participant is asked to maintain (stabilize) their trunk position in the upright posture. Accuracy will be determined by measuring the amount of trunk displacement (measured in degrees with string potentiometers) during the perturbation trial.</description>

The pad will be attached to a load cell that monitors how much force is being generated by their trunk. The robotic platform will provide an angular perturbation to the participant about the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane while the participant is asked to maintain (stabilize) a static force level (projected on a screen in front of them) with their trunk (10% of the average maximum trunk moment). Accuracy will be determined by measuring the difference between the target force level and the actual force level maintained (measured in Newtons with a load cell) during the perturbation trial.</description>

    <description>Participants will be standing and will be asked to generate push force while holding onto a bar (arms along the body, elbows flexed at 90ยบ). The bar will be attached to a load cell that monitors how much force is being applied with the hands. The robotic platform will provide a linear movement (perturbation) of the bar in the horizontal plane while the participant is asked to maintain (stabilize) a static force level (projected on a screen in front of them) with their hands (10% of the average maximum trunk moment). Accuracy will be determined by measuring the difference between the target force level and the actual force level maintained (measured in Newtons with a load cell) during the perturbation trial.</description>
