      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of GPX-150 administered intravenously every 3
      weeks in the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study of GPX-150 in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
      Approximately 22 patients will be treated in this study. The population for this study is
      adult patients with histologically proven advanced and/or metastatic malignant soft tissue
      sarcoma of intermediate or high histologic grade.

      All patients who meet all entry criteria will receive GPX-150 at a starting dose of 265 mg/m2
      every 21 days for 16 cycles or until death, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity or
      subject withdrawal.

      Prior to initiation of treatment, subjects will undergo screening and baseline evaluations.
      During all study visits, subjects will be evaluated for safety. The dose of GPX-150 may be
      reduced when subjects meet specified dose reduction safety criteria. Subjects will be
      evaluated regularly for safety and tolerability. Tumor measurements will be calculated at
      baseline (within 28 days prior to treatment initiation), then at regular intervals while
      receiving treatment for up to 1 year. After discontinuing the treatment phase of the study,
      safety assessments and tumor measurements will be performed 3 weeks after the last dose of
      study drug.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Progression-free at 12 Months Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from the beginning of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the number of patients who were progression-free at 12 months, which is obtained by inversion of the Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months. Of note, the statistical comparison to historical sarcoma data described in the protocol was not performed due to an enrollment of less than the planned sample size of 30 subjects. Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Progression-free at Six Months Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the beginning of the study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary efficacy endpoint is the progression-free rate (PFR) at 6 months, obtained from the Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival (PFS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Experiencing Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the beginning of study treatment and up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who received at least one dose were included in safety analyses. Adverse events were tabulated by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) and coded using MedDRA Version 19.1. Safety and tolerability was determined by frequency, nature, and severity of adverse events and the profile of toxicities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Tumor Response Per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during screening, then every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks on study, and then every 9 weeks for the next 24 weeks for up to 1 year. Subjects will be in the study for up to 1 year, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments using contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan of the Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis were performed to assess overall tumor burden. Response rate (RR), where response is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). Determination of CR or PR requires confirmation at the time of the next tumor assessment. An outcome of SD requires at least one assessment 6 weeks after the initiation of dosing. Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Progression-free at 12 Months Per RECIST 1.1</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the number of patients who were progression-free at 12 months, which is obtained by inversion of the Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months. Of note, the statistical comparison to historical sarcoma data described in the protocol was not performed due to an enrollment of less than the planned sample size of 30 subjects. Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).</description>

        <population>Consists of all subjects in the safety population (22 subjects) and who had at least one on-study tumor assessment using RECIST 1.1 (19 subjects). One subject withdrew consist before first on-study tumor assessment and two subjects died before first on-study tumor assessment.</population>
