  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well PreView, preventive video education, works in increasing
      rates of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening, improving participants' stage of
      change with respect to age appropriate cancer screening and increasing patient-provider
      discussions about prostate cancer screening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the extent to which PreView increases the likelihood that primary care
      patient participants will receive mammograms, pap tests, colon cancer tests or prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) testing discussions with primary care physicians compared with
      participants who receive usual care.

      II. To determine the extent that PreView increases participants' readiness to be screened for
      breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with usual care.

      III. To determine the extent that PreView increases the likelihood that PSA testing will be
      discussed in primary care physician visits compared with usual care.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete PreView, the Video Doctor plus Provider Alert, over 45 minutes on
      an iPad in the waiting room before a doctor visit.

      GROUP II: Patients watch a video about healthy lifestyles including information about
      exercise and healthy eating over 45 minutes on an iPad in the waiting room before a doctor
      visit.
