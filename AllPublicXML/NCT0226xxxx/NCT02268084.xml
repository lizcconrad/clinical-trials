    <description>The primary efficacy outcome measure will consist of the Percentage (%) change in CAPS total severity score at the end of week 2 of treatment. Treatment efficacy will be defined as a statistically significantly greater reduction in mean CAPS total score of the active treatment group compared to the placebo/sham treatment group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the treatment schedule and all required study visits.

          -  Any non-Active Duty Military are included.

          -  PCL-M &gt; 45

          -  Primary diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder rendered by the Clinician
             Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals diagnosed by the Investigator with the following conditions (current
             unless otherwise stated): History of open skull traumatic brain injury. History of
             clinically significant seizure disorder.

          -  Individuals with a clinically defined neurological disorder including, but not limited
             to: Any condition likely to be associated with increased intracranial pressure. Space
             occupying brain lesion. History of cerebrovascular accident. Cerebral aneurysm.

          -  EEG abnormalities that indicate risk of seizure, i.e., abnormal focal or general
             slowing or spikes during the EEG recording.

          -  Any type of rTMS treatment within 3 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Currently under antipsychotic medication treatment.

          -  Intracranial implant (e.g., aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants,
             stents, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head, excluding
             the mouth, which cannot be safely removed.

          -  Clinically significant abnormality or clinically significant unstable medical
             condition that in the Investigator's judgment might pose a potential safety risk to
             the subject or limit interpretation of the trial results.

          -  Clinically significant medical illness, including any uncontrolled thyroid disorders,
             hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary and renal malfunctioning.

          -  Any condition which in the judgment of the investigator would prevent the subject from
             completion of the study.

          -  Inability to acquire a clinically satisfactory EEG/ECG on a routine basis.

          -  Grossly abnormal electrolyte or cell blood count panels suggestive of other pathology
             at study initiation.

          -  Active Duty Military are excluded.
