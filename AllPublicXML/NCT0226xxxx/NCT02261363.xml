  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The universe of tobacco products is expanding, with new noncombustible products gaining
      popularity even as the reduction in prevalence of cigarette smoking slows or stalls.
      E-cigarettes, or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), are the most prevalent of these
      emerging noncombustible products. With sales increasing rapidly and more efficient pulmonary
      delivery devices under development, ENDS are likely to play an increasing role in the future
      tobacco market. Little is known about the cognitions and behaviors leading to or sustaining
      ENDS use. Smokers may use ENDS to subvert smoking restrictions, to reduce perceived smoking
      harms, or for smoking cessation. Evidence about ENDS use is emerging from national
      surveillance and laboratory research, but the majority of information on ENDS is limited to
      retrospective surveys and convenience samples of White male ENDS users. The investigators
      research suggests Black smokers are less likely than White smokers to try and be current ENDS
      users, perhaps due to a greater degree of perceived harm associated with ENDS, a preference
      for menthol, or cultural norms. Thus, it is timely and critical to study how all smokers,
      including Blacks and menthol smokers, experience and initiate ENDS use employing valid,
      innovative research methods.

        In total, our goal is to enroll 150 individuals, with 120 participants completing the
        protocol. For the main arm of the study, we will recruit a racially and ethnically diverse
        sample of 140 daily smokers (or 100 study completers), with the goal of recruiting at least
        50% non-Hispanic black participants. For the second study arm, we will enroll an additional
        30 participants, with the goal of 20 individuals completing the protocol. There are no
        race/ethnicity recruitment goals associated with the second arm. In total, the main study
        arm will consist of 100 daily smokers who do not intend to quit smoking in the next 30
        days, while the second arm will include 20 daily smokers who do intend to quit smoking in
        the next 30 days.
