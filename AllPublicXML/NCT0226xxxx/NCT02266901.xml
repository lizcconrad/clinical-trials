      Patients presenting intra-abdominal abcesses following bariatric surgery complicated by
      fistulae are classically treated by external drainage and endoprosthesis or surgical redo.
      Morbidity and mortality being increased in case of necrotic collections, an endoscopic
      debridement treatment might be proposed in certain cases. This present study aim to review
      the evolution of the patients treated by this method from 2007 to 2011 in the investigators
      institution.

      This retrospective study in an academic tertiary center will review the files of patients who
      underwent endoscopic drainage and debridement of abdominal abscesses secondary to bariatric
      surgery leaks . The decision for endoscopic treatment was made by the medico-surgical team in
      charge of this type of surgery, who had to weigh the high risk of mortality in case of
      re-intervention, along with endoscopic access to abscesses via the transluminal or
      percutaneous route based on abdominal imaging.

      Data collection will lead to the evaluation of the technical success rate, the clinical
      success and potential complications.

    <description>Endoscopic percutaneous access was obtained through surgical drains or after ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage with a thin scope , and transluminal procedures with large scopes through the leak hole. All the procedures were performed under general anesthesia and carbon dioxide insufflation. Debridement was done by pus aspiration and irrigation.</description>
