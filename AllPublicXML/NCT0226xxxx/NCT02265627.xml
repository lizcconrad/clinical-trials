          -  Volunteers will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon
             the following: a detailed medical and surgical history, a complete physical
             examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG, complete blood count (CBC) with
             differential and platelets, prothrombin time (PT), blood chemistry, hematology and

          -  Female subjects need to be of non-childbearing potential (post-menopausal), tubal
             ligation or total hysterectomy) and had to provide a negative pregnancy test at the
             screening visit or subjects is a male
