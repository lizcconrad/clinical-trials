             cholesterol, pregnancy test. HIV test (with prior written consent), serum tests for
             Chagas disease, hepatic b and syphilis, complete urinalysis, ECG (electrocardiogram)
             and chest x-ray

             weeks

          -  Volunteers who must start a treatment incompatible with this trial during its course

          -  Volunteers who do not comply with the fasting requirements established in the trial or
             who do not comply with trial requirements such as avoiding intake of coffee, tea, cola
             soft drinks, etc. for 24 hours prior to the start of the trial

          -  History of allergy or intolerance to Epinastine
