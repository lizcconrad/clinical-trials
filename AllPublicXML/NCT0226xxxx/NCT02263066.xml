        centers (HTCs) with available medical data record, having received rFVIII contained regular
        prophylaxis between Nov. 1st 2007 and May 31st 2013 will be enrolled from about 15 centers.

             treatment, totally/partially with rFⅧ. Regular prophylaxis/bleeding prevention
             treatment is defined as that proportion of weeks (≥2 infusion/week) of total treatment
             weeks≥80%[10] , and total duration ≥12 weeks. During the regular prophylaxis period,
             if there were consecutive 4 weeks that ＜2 infusion/week, the beginning day of the 4
             weeks is defined as the end of regular prophylaxis.

             antibody formation (≥0.6BU by Bethesda assay at two different time points,
             documentation must be available) Any individuals with another bleeding disease that is
             different from hemophilia A (e.g, von Willebrand disease, hemophilia B)
