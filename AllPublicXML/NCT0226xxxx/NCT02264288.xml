    <textblock>
      The PDA-002-DFU-002 trial is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled, dose range finding study. The study will enroll approximately 133 subjects in
      four treatment groups. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of PDA-002 administered intramuscular (IM) in subjects who have DFU with and without
      PAD. The secondary objective is to explore potential clinical efficacy by assessing changes
      in vascular parameters such as Ankle-Brachial Index and Toe-Brachial Index (ABI and/or TBI),
      Transcutaneous oxygen measurements (TcPO2).
