  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental one-carbon nutrient intake (folic acid and choline) and the genetic polymorphisms of
      one-carbon metabolic enzyme were interact with regulating embryonic one-carbon metabolic
      environment, affect fetal DNA and RNA biosynthesis and methyl modification of the genome
      molecule, to promote the individual nutrient growth factor of growth and development.
      Inadequate maternal one-carbon nutrient intake combined with genetic polymorphisms of
      one-carbon enzymatic mutation, causing one-carbon malnutrition, change fetal methyl metabolic
      nutrition environment. It not only leads to fetal growth mutation - such as folate and
      choline deficiency, increasing the risk of fetal neural tube defect but also induce abnormal
      modifying of fetuses's post-genomic methylation markers, may alter imprinted genes function
      of progenitors, recompile threshold sensitivity or domain in regulation of metabolic
      reactions of offspring, resulting in long-lasting effect, increasing the risk of chronic
      diseases of offspring such as cancer. According to the National Nutrition Survey results show
      that a considerable proportion of the Taiwanese people had poor one-carbon nutritional
      status. 48% of women intake 66% below the recommended intake reference value of folate.
      Whether inadequate parental one-carbon nutrients intake combined with genetic polymorphisms
      of one-carbon enzymatic mutation will cause one-carbon malnutrition of fetus, affecting fetal
      growth and modifying the risk of cancer development relationship of offspring. It is due to
      the lack of local ethnic data and empirical scientific reference at home and abroad, so it
      can not plan an effective maternal and children nutrient education and prevention strategies
      about methyl nutrition for early cancer prevention for Taiwanese. Therefore, indigenous
      people is the intended population of study in this project, screening of healthy pregnant
      women with high risk factor for cancer and obese pregnant women, and detection of one-carbon
      nutrient intake and biochemical assessment of the nutritional status of the study group.
      Supplying nutrition education intervention or multivitamin supplement to improve the poor
      nutritional status of persons. Using related DNA methylation imprint marker about offspring
      growth and modifying development of cancer as assessment, this project explores the
      appropriate one-carbon nutrient intake in parents and children and the assessments in
      regulation of growth and reducing the cancer-related risk.
