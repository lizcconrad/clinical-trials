    <textblock>
      This national study was a post-marketing surveillance study conducted in Korea from 29 August
      2008 to 28 August 2012 to meet local regulatory requirements for Mircera
      (monopegylated-epoetin beta). Prospective participant-based data collection was evaluated for
      safety/risk assessments and effectiveness. No specific study-related procedures are required.
      Participants were to be followed up as long as possible at the physician's discretion.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE) and a Serious Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>At physician's discretion, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with Mircera and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with Mircera. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least one of the following criteria: is fatal; is life threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At physician's discretion, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ADRs were defined as any response to a drug which was noxious and unintended, and which occurred at dose normally used related to the pharmacological properties. It was defined as any AE categorized as &quot;definitely related&quot;,&quot;probably related&quot;, &quot;possibly related&quot;, and &quot;unknown&quot; by investigators. In case that an ADR was not written on local Korean Mircera label, it was classified as &quot;Unexpected&quot;. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with Mircera and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with Mircera.</description>
