    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure plasma nicotine uptake parameters, physiological
      measures, and subjective effect measures in smokers during and following a single ad libitum
      use of three electronic cigarettes versus combustible cigarettes and nicotine gum.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess various elements that may provide information regarding the potential
      for electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to be adopted by current smokers. These various
      elements include: a) nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK), b) physiological measures of pulse rate
      and blood pressure, and c) subjective effects measured by Urge to Smoke, Product Rating,
      Intent to Use Product Again, and Product Effects.

             limited to any nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, patch),
             varenicline (Chantix), bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban), or lobelia extract within (≤) 30
             days of Screening.

          8. Females ≥ 35 years of age currently using systemic, estrogen containing contraception
             or hormone replacement therapy.

          9. A positive urine drug screen without disclosure of corresponding prescribed
