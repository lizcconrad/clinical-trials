    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Losartan when used for
      treatment of an acute grade II or III hamstring strain and determining the effect of losartan
      on recovery of hamstring muscle function. Subjects will be adults age 18-35 with grade 2 or 3
      hamstring injury who participate in Level 1 athletics or have a similar physical work load
      (e.g. military personnel). Military personnel will only be recruited at Brookings Medical
      Institute. Subjects will undergo examination, MRI, and functional assessment before, during,
      and after 4 weeks of losartan (50mg QD) or placebo.

    <measure>Recovery of hamstring muscle function and structure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Related to specific aim 2, hamstring muscle function of the injured leg will be measured and compared to the contralateral leg using isometric hamstring torque. Hamstring function is measured by comparing pre-treatment MRI to MRI at 6 months post-treatment</description>

    <measure>Return to prior level of function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
