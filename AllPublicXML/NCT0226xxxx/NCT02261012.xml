    <textblock>
      This study aims for a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the
      complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). This will be done by testing the quantitative sensory
      testing, the remote ischemic conditioning, the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and the
      analysis of the heart-rate variability in patients with CRPS and a control-group. We
      hypothesize decreased conditioned pain modulation, less effects of remote ischemic
      conditioning and an affection of the heart-rate variability in patients with CPRS.

    <textblock>
      CRPS is an illness which (seriously) affects patients in their daily life activity. The fact
      that the pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood yet makes it hard to treat
      these patients in the right manner.

      Possible patho-mechanisms might be microvascular changes and dysfunctions of the inhibitory
      descending pain system. Furthermore, recent studies showed that CRPS patients have
      macrovascular changes and a lower blood level of NO on the affected side. This indicates a NO
      mediated perfusion dysfunction.

      Aim of this study is to examine the pathophysiological mechanism of CRPS in relation to
      healthy subjects and patients with a different type of pain syndrome (carpal tunnel syndrome)
      on the upper limb.

      The investigators try to get a better understanding of the changes in the pain inhibitory
      system and micro- and macrocirculating blood-systems, as well as of the autonomic system of
      CRPS-patients.
