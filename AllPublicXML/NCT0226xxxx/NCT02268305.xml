  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying whether MSM plus standard of care naproxen improves symptoms
      of lower back pain compared to standard of care naproxen plus placebo. Subjects will be
      randomized into 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take by mouth 6000 milligrams (mgs) of MSM plus
      standard of care naproxen. Group 2 will take by mouth placebo capsules plus standard of care
      naproxen. Subjects will be instructed to take their study pills for 12 weeks and record on a
      study diary. They will then be followed up for one final visit 4 weeks later. RMDQ, PIQ-6,
      pain level, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC) will be assessed
      at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks. Subjects' participation will last 16 weeks.

    <textblock>
      We will recruit male and female MOFMC DoD beneficiaries between the ages of 18-65 years old
      with symptoms of lower back pain from any of the clinics at the MOFMC at Nellis Air Force
      Base. Patients taking Muscle relaxers of any type, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
      (NSAIDs), Tramadol, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, agree to wash out for two weeks prior to entering
      the study.

      Screening Visit:

        -  Obtain signed Informed Consent Document and HIPAA Authorization.

        -  Review inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        -  Record: name, race ethnicity, race, date of birth, age, sex, height (in inches), weight
           (in pounds), blood pressure, email address, phone number, history of lower back
           surgeries, medical history, concomitant medications, and record the amount of naproxen
           prescribed as standard of care.

        -  Subjects will have the following research-driven blood test drawn via 1 venipuncture
           (5-10 mls, approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood drawn for each test) which include:

             -  Women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test.

             -  Comprehensive metabolic panel (liver function, renal function, plasma glucose
                tests).

                *Subjects who have had a comprehensive metabolic panel test within the one week
                prior to this visit will not need to have this test repeated unless they are
                abnormal.

             -  Complete Blood Count. *Subjects who have had a complete blood count test within the
                one week prior to this visit will not need to have this test repeated unless they

           subjects and investigators will be blinded to the study group assignments:

             -  Group 1 will take by mouth three 1000 mg capsules twice a day (6000 mgs) of MSM
                plus standard of care naproxen.

             -  Group 2 will take by mouth three placebo capsules twice a day plus standard of care
