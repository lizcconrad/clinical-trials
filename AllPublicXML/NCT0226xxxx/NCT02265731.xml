             options considered standard of care) as defined in the World Health Organization
             classification scheme and relapsed following or be refractory to standard treatments
             such as R-CHOP, R-CVP, or fludarabine based regimens. Participants with other

             monitor

             relapsed or be refractory to standard treatments such as fludarabine based regimens or
             alkylator based regimens

          -  Untreated AML subjects or Relapsed or refractory AML subjects must have been
             previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 1;
             adequate bone marrow independent of growth factor support per local laboratory
             reference range; and adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory
             reference range at Screening

          -  Participants with a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation must
             have adequate blood counts independent of growth factor support and have recovered
             from any transplant-related toxicity(s) and be at least 100 days post-autologous
             transplant (multiple myeloma) or 6 month post-autologous transplant (NHL) prior to
             first dose of study drug or at least 6 months post-allogenic transplant (multiple
             myeloma) prior to first dose of study drug and not have active graft-versus-host
             disease (GVHD), i.e., requiring treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  NHL participants who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant or were
             diagnosed with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease, Burkitt's lymphoma,
             Burkitt-like lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia

          -  Participant tested positive for HIV

          -  Participant has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class
             greater or equal to 2

          -  Participant has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary,
             endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this
             study.

          -  Participant received a monoclonal antibody for anti-neoplastic intent within 8 weeks
             prior to the first dose of study drug.
