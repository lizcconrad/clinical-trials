  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital HPV is the necessary cause for cervical cancer, as well as a major contributing cause
      of several other cancers and conditions. There are now effective vaccines against the main
      oncogenic HPV types, HPV16 and 18.

      Most research and discussion has focused on targeting the vaccine to young women and older
      adolescents. Based on this, a national free HPV vaccination program for adolescent girls
      commenced in 2007, in Australia. However, at the time of commencement, there had been no
      research on the use of this vaccine in immunosuppressed. Therefore, information on the
      immunogenicity, safety and duration of efficacy of HPV vaccine when administered to
      immunosuppressed children is needed. This trial looked at a 3 dose schedule of quadrivalent
      HPV vaccine in a range of immunosuppressed children, with the endpoint being immunogenicity,
      followed for 5 years for duration of immunity.

      To determine the immunogenicity, safety and persistence of immunity following human
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in three groups of immunosuppressed children: recipients of
      allogenic bone marrow transplant, recipients of renal and liver transplants, and patients
      with juvenile chronic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune conditions
      who are on longterm immunosuppressive therapy.

      Significance: Immunosuppressed populations are diverse in terms of degree, type and duration
      of immunosuppression. The study compares several groups in order to address the heterogeneity
      of immunosuppression and how this affects vaccine response. BMT patients have extreme, severe
      immunosuppression in the short term, but recover immune function with time. In contrast,
      solid organ transplant recipients have ongoing, chronic immunosuppression. Although
      successful cessation of immunosuppressives in liver transplant patients has been reported,
      most patients require ongoing treatment. The inflammatory bowel disease group of patients
      represents a non-transplant group who require ongoing, often low level immunosuppression,
      often with corticosteroids. Our study will compare these three groups, followed up for five
      years for duration of immunity. Time of vaccines, time of serological measures of immune
      response are as follows.

      Serum collections:

      0 - Baseline (before HPV vaccine dose 1); 2 months - At the time of receipt of HPV vaccine
      dose 2 (to measure response to dose 1); 6 months - At the time of receipt of HPV vaccine dose
      3 (to measure response to dose 2); 7 months - 1 month after HPV vaccine dose 3; 12 months -
      after HPV vaccine dose 1; 2 years after HPV vaccine dose 1; 3 years after HPV vaccine dose 1;
      4 years after HPV vaccine dose 1; 5 years after HPV vaccine dose 1.

    <description>Indicator:
Geometric mean four fold rises (with 95% confidence intervals) of the vaccine serotype specific IgG antibody in all participants.
Proportion of subjects achieving a 4 fold rise in antibody titre for each serotype. Serum antibody levels will be measured using a Luminex immunoassay.
Analysis: For each individual, the change in log-22FA levels for each serotype pre-post vaccination will be calculated. The average change will then be compared over time for each group and also between healthy and immunosuppressed groups using t-tests. Geometric mean titres of antibody for each serotype will be measured and compared at each follow up interval.</description>
