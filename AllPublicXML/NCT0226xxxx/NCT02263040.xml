      The objective of this pilot study is to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of
      Fluzone High Dose with Fluzone (standard adult dose) influenza vaccines in healthcare
      workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled, observer blind trial of HDTIV (Fluzone High
      Dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) versus SDTIV (Fluzone, standard dose TIV) in
      100 healthcare workers 18-64 years of age. Participants will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, one
      dose of either SDTIV or HDTIV containing the strains of influenza virus as recommended by the
      World Health Organization for the season of recruitment. All adverse events will be collected
      for 7 days following the injection, serious adverse events will be collected through day 21,
      and serum for antibody testing will be obtained on day 0 and day 21. The primary outcome will
      be seroconversion to each strain of vaccine included in the vaccine, as measured by change in
      HAI titer between day 0 to day 21.

             working in an acute care hospital or long term healthcare facility;

          3. Has access to email and the internet for adverse event reporting, or is willing to
             complete forms on paper and deliver to the site study office;

          4. Understand the study, agree to its requirements, and give written consent;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receipt of influenza vaccine for the current northern hemisphere season prior to
