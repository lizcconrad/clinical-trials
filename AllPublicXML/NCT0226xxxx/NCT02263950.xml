    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will assess whether a medicine called artemether, currently used at a
      lower dose to treat malaria, could also be useful in treating cancer. For this trial, the
      medicine is given in a new way, as a spray under the tongue. This delivery has several
      advantages, including better absorption into the body and it may be easier for people to
      take. It will be prescribed to consenting patients with advanced solid tumours, every day for
      4 months, either once or twice a day. (For this study 'advanced tumour' will mean there are
      no other effective standard therapy options available to the patient).

      The dose will be decided in Phase 1 of the study by initially testing 3 different doses of
      the medicine in up to 21 different cancer patients, to make sure it is not too toxic or
      causes any side effects.

      After this, the highest safe dose identified in the first phase will be tested in up to 66
      cancer patients in Phase 2 of the study, to see if the medicine is able to reduce the size of
      their tumour or slow down its growth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects of 18 years or older at the Screening Visit.

          2. Histologic and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumour with clinical and
             imaging evidence that the tumour is advanced and for whom there is no effective
             standard therapy available.

          3. At least one evaluable tumour that is at least 10 mm by computerised tomography (CT)
             scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the pre-treatment stage

          4. At least one prior systemic anti-cancer treatment and disease that is refractory or
             progressive following treatment.

          5. Eastern Co operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance â‰¤ 2.

          6. An adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function.

          7. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test before
             the start of treatment.

             contraception, as detailed in the protocol.

          9. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partner must meet the criteria defined in the protocol (i.e., not of
             childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the
             study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). Those with partners
             using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of

             participate in the trial.

          3. Allergic to artemether or other artemisinin derivatives or any of the components of
             the sublingual formulation.

          4. Pregnancy or lactation.

             study drug; subject has not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery
             (defined as requiring general anaesthesia) or subject might require major surgery
             during the course of the study.

          6. Subject has had anti-cancer treatment within 4 weeks of start of study drug, excluding
             small field palliative irradiation which may be performed up to 2 weeks prior to start
             of study drug.

          7. Subject has had prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4
             weeks before study start.
