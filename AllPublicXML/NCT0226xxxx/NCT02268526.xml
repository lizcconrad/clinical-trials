      This study is randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. 80 Patients will be
      enrolled and randomized to CSJ148 and placebo in a ratio of 3:1. Patients undergoing stem
      cell transplantation will be enrolled into the study. The study will consist of a screening
      period, a baseline visit, approximately 3-month treatment exposure period, an end-of-therapy
      visit, a follow-up period, and a study completion evaluation approximately 3.5 months after
      the last dose of study drug is administered.

          4. Scheduled to undergo allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood
             transplantation (transplant may be related or unrelated, T-cell depleted or non-T-cell
             depleted, myeloablative or non-myeloablative/reduced intensity, haploidentical) and
             began conditioning chemotherapy within 48 hours of planned dosing day.

          5. Patient seropositive for HCMV before transplantation; donor could be seropositive or
             seronegative for HCMV (donor positive/recipient or donor negative/recipient positive).
             Historical patient HCMV serology data collected within the last 12 months or local
             assays could be used to qualify the patient for enrollment.

          6. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria were not eligible for inclusion in this
        study:

          1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives
             of enrollment, or until the expected PD (pharmacodynamic) effect has returned to
             baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations.

          2. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical
             classes.

          3. Karnofsky performance score &lt;50%.

          4. Had HCMV-related organ disease within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          5. Detectable HCMV infection (positive pp65 antigenemia or plasma HCMV DNA polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) assays prior to enrollment from samples collected within 14 days
             prior to enrollment. Local assays could be used to qualify the patient for enrollment.

          6. Received any of the following within 30 days prior to enrollment: ganciclovir,
             valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, acyclovir (&gt;25 mg/kg/day IV), valacyclovir (&gt;3
             gm/day oral), famciclovir (&gt;1500 mg/day oral), HCMV immune globulin, immune globulin
             (&gt;500 mg/kg), or any other medication with anti-HCMV activity.

          7. Required mechanical ventilation within 7 days prior to enrollment.

          8. Received any vasopressors or other agents for hemodynamic support within 7 days prior
             to enrollment. These agents included but are not limited to epinephrine, metaraminol,
             norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, phenylephrine, and dobutamine.

          9. Impaired renal function requiring dialysis.

         10. Any surgical or medical condition which might increase the risk for thrombotic events
             if given immunoglobulins. These conditions included cryoglobulinemia, monoclonal
             gammopathies, and hypertriglyceridemia (fasting level &gt;1000 mg/dL). The investigator
             should make this determination in consideration of the subject's medical history and
             laboratory data.

         11. Severe liver disease or liver injury as indicated one or more of the following:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5-times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;5-times the upper limit of normal.

               -  Gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) &gt;5-times the upper limit of normal.

               -  Serum total bilirubin (TBL) &gt;3-times the upper limit of normal.

         12. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy was defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test.

         13. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they were using effective methods of contraception during
             dosing of study treatment.

             Effective contraception methods included:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). In case
                  of use of oral contraception women would have been stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women were considered
                  post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they had 12 months of
                  natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or had surgical bilateral
                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks
                  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
                  woman had been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment was she considered
                  not of child bearing potential.

         14. History of positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test result. Testing was not
             required. No additional exclusions were applied by the investigator, in order to
             ensure that the study population was representative of all eligible patients.

      <desc>Additional 2 deaths in placebo occurred during follow-up (Day 100 to 183) after early treatment and study discontinuation. One additional placebo death occurred after end of study (Day 183) and 7 additional CSJ148 deaths occurred post end of study (Day 183).
Patients treated with CSJ148 in Cohorts 1 and 2 were pooled to simplify the safety analyses because the dosage of CSJ148 was the same for each cohort. Cohort 1 was just a PK cohort with only 6 patients.</desc>
