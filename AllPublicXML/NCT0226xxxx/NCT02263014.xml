    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about how different treatment decisions may
      influence the quality of life in women with breast cancer. Researchers want to use what is
      learned from this study to help future patients with breast cancer to be more informed when
      making treatment decisions.

      With your verbal permission, you may have been asked to complete a questionnaire about your
      surgical treatment preferences for breast cancer as part of initial screening for this study.
      This takes about 5 minutes to complete.

      If you agree to participate in this study, during the same visit you will complete a
      questionnaire about your background, such as your education level, marital status, and family
      history of cancer. This should take about 3 minutes to complete.

      You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about your surgery decisions and your
      feelings about those decisions at the following times: around the time you enroll in study
      before your surgery, and again about 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after the surgery is completed.
      This questionnaire should take about 30-40 minutes to complete each time. You may complete
      this questionnaire at the clinic or you may complete it at home. If you chose to complete the
      questionnaire at home, you will be given a postage-paid envelope to mail it back to the study
      staff.

      Length of Study:

      After you complete all of the questionnaires, your participation in this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      A total of up to 345 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 245 will take part at
      MD Anderson and up to 100 will take part at Kelsey-Seybold.
