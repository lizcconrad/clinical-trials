  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor
      before standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II
      or III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Advances in radiation
      oncology have allowed better radiation targeting which may be able to send x-rays directly to
      the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more precise and
      targeted radiation before standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells and prevent the cancer from coming back in the location in which it started.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the primary tumor control rate at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. II. To estimate the rates of
      regional, distant control as well as progression-free survival and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to this regimen. IV. To evaluate the
      response of tumors to stereotactic (high-dose) radiation using magnetic resonance tumor
      perfusion imaging modalities (magnetic resonance [MR]-dynamic contrast-enhanced
      [DCE]/perfusion weighted imaging [PWI], MR-diffusion, blood oxygenation level dependent
      [BOLD] sequences).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients will receive a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor over 2 fractions (at
      least 40 hours apart) during week 1. Beginning week 2, patients receive cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) on days 8, 15, 36, and 43; and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 8-12
      and 36-40. If carboplatin and paclitaxel is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, 2
      cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6 mg/min/mL IV on day 1, 22) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 IV on day
      1, 22) consolidation chemotherapy are required, to be administered starting 4-6 weeks after
      concurrent chemoradiation has ended. Each cycle is 21 days long. If cisplatin and etoposide
      is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy is not allowed.
      Patients also undergo standard conformal radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for
      a total of 30 fractions. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
