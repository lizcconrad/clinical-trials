    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how the investigational drug,
      LY3022855, affects the immune system in participants with advanced breast or prostate cancer
      that has not responded to other treatments. Treatment may last up to 6 cycles (cycle = 6
      weeks).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of advanced, refractory breast or prostate cancer that is
             evaluable by radiologic testing. Participants must have experienced tumor progression
             on or treatment intolerance to at least one prior therapy.

          -  For participants with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer only:

               -  Must continue ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with castrate levels of serum
                  testosterone &lt;50 nanogram/deciliter (ng/dL)

               -  If receiving an antiandrogen as part of first-line hormonal therapy, must have
                  shown progression of disease off the antiandrogen prior to enrollment

               -  Must be willing to continue androgen deprivation therapy while on study, if no
                  prior orchiectomy

               -  Must meet at least 1 of the following 3 criteria for progressive metastatic
                  disease, according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria:

                    -  A rise in prostate-specific antigen (minimal value 2 ng/milliliter (mL); ≥3
                       consecutive rising values)

                    -  ≥2 new metastases on transaxial imaging or radionuclide bone scan

                    -  Soft tissue progression

               -  Replacement hormone therapy initiated before study entry is permitted

               -  For participants with breast cancer only:

                    -  May continue ongoing antiestrogen

                    -  Replacement hormone therapy initiated before study entry is permitted

                    -  May continue ongoing trastuzumab therapy

          -  Have adequate organ function, including: Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of
             normal (ULN), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             ≤3.0 × ULN. For participants with tumor involvement of the liver, AST and ALT ≤5.0 ×
             ULN are acceptable. For participants with tumor involvement of the bone, alkaline
             phosphatase ≤5.0 × ULN is acceptable. Renal: Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN. Absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 109/liter (L). Hemoglobin ≥9 grams per deciliter (5.58
             millimoles per liter). Platelets ≥90 × 109/L.

          -  Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.

          -  Have discontinued all disease-modifying therapy for the primary cancer &gt;28 days prior

             investigator).

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis.
