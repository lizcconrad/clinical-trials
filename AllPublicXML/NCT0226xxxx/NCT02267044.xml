  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder replacement surgery is recognized as having the potential to cause a considerable
      amount of postoperative pain. Adequate management of pain after surgery is necessary not only
      to improve the patient's wellbeing but also to facilitate recovery. Several regional
      anesthesia techniques are available to combat postoperative pain in the shoulder replacement
      surgery patient, however, which method provides superior pain relief remains unknown. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a continuous interscalene block
      versus a single shot interscalene block for postoperative pain relief in the shoulder
      replacement patient.

      Patients undergoing shoulder replacement surgery will experience more effective pain relief
      with a continuous interscalene block versus and single shot interscalene block.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. 76 patients receiving either primary total
      shoulder replacement, hemiarthroplasty, or reverse total shoulder replacement will be
      randomized to a regional anesthesia technique as part of their surgical procedure. 38
      patients will receive a single shot interscalene block containing ropivicaine and 38 patients
      will receive a continuous interscalene block containing ropivicaine.

    <description>Continuous Interscalene block patients will receive a shot of up to 30ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine and then a catheter is placed. The catheter is secured with Dermabond and Tegaderm. Once surgery is complete, the catheter is connected to a pain ball system which holds 400ml of 0.2% Ropivacaine local anesthetic. The rate is locked in at 8ml/hr. Catheter is pulled once the pain ball is empty.</description>
