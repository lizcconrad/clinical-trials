  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tension headache is a common disabling disease and a worldwide public health problem. This
      research tries to demonstrate the efficacy of physical therapy, based on cervical training
      and postural self-correction instructions, which aims to increase the positive results
      obtained from traditional relaxation techniques (Schultz Autogenic Training). University
      students are selected, because headaches are very common in this sector of the population.
      The design is a non-pharmacological randomized controlled trial, with blinded evaluation of
      the response variables. The investigators compare two independent samples. One of them
      receives an only treatment (Autogenic Training) and the other group receives a combined
      program (Autogenic Training + specific cervical exercises and postural correction). Pain
      parameters (frequency, intensity and duration) and drug consumption are measured before
      treatment, and then, at 4 weeks and 3 months, to value the results.
