  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the
      safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study
      hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful
      venous access after first attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiVein System uses transillumination of skin tissue to aid in cannulation and consists
      of the OptiVein IV Catheter with an integrated optical fiber, and an electronic unit. The
      electronic unit is a portable internally powered generator of low power visible laser light
      of green color. The electronic unit generates visible light, which is released from the tip
      of the needle into the soft tissue around the tip of the IV catheter. Light is visible
      through the skin and helps mark the location of the tip of the needle under the skin and
      against the vein.

      In addition to pinpointing the exact location of the tip of the needle, the OptiVein System
      informs the user of the exact moment of penetration of the tip of the needle into the blood
      vessel. Hemoglobin in blood strongly absorbs visible light of specific wavelengths, so when
      the needle enters the blood vessel, the light is instantly absorbed by blood, which causes
      instant fading of skin transillumination. Instant disappearance of tissue illumination
      indicates successful venipuncture. The user can then lower the angle of the needle and start
      to advance the cannula over the needle into the blood vessel. Such optical confirmation is
      much faster than the traditional observation of blood in the flashback chamber of the needle
      and should lead to increased first-attempt success rates and decreased cannulation-related
      complications.

      The use of OptiVein device will be compared to the use of a traditional IV catheter to
      explore the potential increase of effectiveness of cannulation with OptiVein versus
      traditional IV catheters.
