  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine whether accelerometry can be used to measure physical activity
      occurring during routine clinical care in a diverse population of patients with medical or
      surgical critical illness.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that meet inclusion criteria will have a wristwatch size, lightweight ActiGraph
      GT3X+ placed at each of three body sites, the dominant-side wrist, right hip and
      dominant-side ankle to objectively measure physical activity. Patients will wear the
      ActiGraph devices during two 30-minute periods of direct observation. To compare activity
      counts measured by the ActiGraph devices with directly observed purposeful physical activity,
      we will record the time and type of physical activity performed by patients such as sitting
      at the edge of the bed, sitting in a bedside chair, transferring to a chair, standing and
      ambulating. The data acquired from this observational (AMERCIA) study will seek to establish
      the feasibility of using accelerometers to measure activity in a diverse population of
      patients with medical or surgical critical illness.

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess tolerability of the ActiGraph devices through the assessment of the number of total hours devices are worn (out of 120 hours of possible measurement time). We will record the time of device removal and replacement as well as reasons for device removal. Patients will be routinely evaluated for device-related discomfort and devices will be repositioned or removed accordingly. Finally, at the conclusion of the study period, patients will be surveyed regarding the tolerability of the devices.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be included if they are:

          1. adult patients,

          2. admitted to the medical or surgical ICU,

          3. receiving or have received invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for
             respiratory failure or vasopressors for shock (i.e., cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, septic
             or undifferentiated shock) within the last 48 hours, and

          4. who are receiving routine physical and occupational therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Those who have severe physical disability that prevented independent living prior to
             their illness,

          2. Those unable to speak and communicate in English,

          3. Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive
             treatment by the family or medical team (i.e., likely to withdraw life support
             measures within 24 hours of screening),

          4. Inability to obtain informed consent from authorized surrogate;
