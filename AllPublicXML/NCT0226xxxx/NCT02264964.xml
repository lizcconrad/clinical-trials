  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration and adverse events of non-cuffed catheter in patients with hemodialysis will be
      investigated by multicenter prospective cohort. Totally, 1,400 patients with chronic renal
      failure requiring hemodialysis will be enrolled. 900 patients will be given right internal
      jugular catheterization, and the other 500 patients unsuitable for right internal jugular
      catheterization will receive femoral catheterizations. Every patient will be followed-up for
      six months. During following-up period, the duration time and adverse events of non-cuffed
      catheter will be recorded in details, including inadequate hemodialysis blood flow, venous
      stenosis, venous thrombosis, infection, catheter thrombosis and so on. The central vein will
      be evaluated by CT Angiography to identify its stenosis at last visit after 6 months. This
      multicentre trial will provide evidence to develop guideline for duration time of using
      non-cuffed catheter.
