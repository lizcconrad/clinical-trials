  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part I of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous
      (IV) doses of MK-2640 in healthy participants and to obtain preliminary plasma
      pharmacokinetic profiles of MK-2640. The purpose of Parts II and III of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV doses of MK-2640 and regular human insulin (RHI),
      and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of MK-2640 and RHI in
      participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part II will be initiated only if Part I
      general safety, tolerability and other observed data are supportive of progression to Part
      II. Part III will be initiated only if Parts I and II general safety, tolerability and other
      observed data are supportive of progression to Part III.
