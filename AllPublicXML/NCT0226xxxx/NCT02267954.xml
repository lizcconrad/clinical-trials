    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to discover if people of different demographic levels are more or less
      attentive to changes in calorie information vs. changes in price information on a restaurant
      menu. The investigators will record whether the calorie/price change was noticed or not, as
      well as how quickly the calorie/price change was noticed, depending on condition and
      individual differences.

      Participants complete a short study regarding their ability to detect &quot;mistakes&quot; in a printed
      version of a fast food restaurant menu. We ask participants to identify the differences
      between the menu board and a typical menu board at that location. Individuals list the
      differences that they find and have a chance to win a prize if they identify the most
      mistakes among participants recruited that day. The differences created will remain constant
      (e.g., featuring Pepsi products instead of the typical Coca-Cola offerings, including items
      from other restaurants on the menu), including changes to calorie labels and price labels.
      Additionally, we recruit participants in a variety of locations to test for differences
      between demographics (e.g., income groups, education levels, and BMI levels).

    <description>The participant is exposed to the baseline menu, but the prices are edited to be at 50% of the actual price (e.g., a $1 coffee is listed as costing $.50) and the calorie labels are edited to be at 50% of the actual content (e.g., a 500 calorie Large Fries is listed as having 250 calories). In addition, the baseline mistakes are still included.
This is the &quot;Menu edited&quot; intervention.</description>
