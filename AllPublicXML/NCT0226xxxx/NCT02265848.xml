      stimulation programming of the spinal cord stimulator for subjects who already have a spinal
      cord stimulator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject with Precision models of spinal cord stimulators will be invited to take part in the
      study that will compare the high frequency stimulation versus low frequency stimulation to
      look for any changes in efficacy, and preferability between high and low frequency
      stimulation program for the spinal cord stimulator (SCS) system.

      The study is designed as 7 week study that can take up to 9 weeks per subject. 7 weeks are
      divided into 3 segments. First segment will be 3 weeks of spinal cord stimulation followed by
      second segment of wash off period, which will take 1 week (7 days), then the last segment
      with 3 weeks of spinal cord stimulation. At the end of each segments, there will be a follow
      up visits.

      Each follow up visits can occur up to 5 business days after the follow up due date for post
      spinal cord stimulation follow ups, and up to 3 business days after the follow up due date
      for the post wash off visit.

      At each visits, including baseline, subject will be asked to answer Numeric Pain Rating Scale
      (NPRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC) to
      assess interval effect of the programming parameter for the spinal cord stimulator.

    <description>Digital pain rating system that scores patient's subjective pain rating from 0 to 10; with greater number indicating progressively worsening pain. NPRS were measured at baseline (visit1), and at each follow ups visits at visit 2, 3 and 4.

    <time_frame>Baseline (visit 1), and at each follow up visits (visits 2, 3, and 4)</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a outcome metrics that is design to assess the severity of disability based on 10 activity categories. ODI is based on 0 to 100% scale, where larger percentage implies worse disability. (There are 5 categories: 0-20%: Minimal disability, 21-40%: Moderate disability, 41-60%: Severe disability, 61-80%: Crippled. 81-100%: Either bed bound or exaggerating symptoms). ODI were measured at baseline (visit1), and at each follow ups visits at visit 2, 3 and 4. Visit 2 and 4 captured post treatment (either 1000 Hz or standard stimulation depending on the randomization) results, and visit 3 captured NPRS after the wash off from the spinal cord stimulation.</description>

      <recruitment_details>All study subjects were recruited from the Carolinas Pain Institute who were implanted with Boston Scientific's Precision Plus spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system for chronic axial pain, and at the time of recruitment, was not receiving adequate pain relief from SCS system with baseline numeric pain rating scale of 5 or greater.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization scheme was 1 to 1 ratio. Randomization assignment was generated using random number generator, and individual results were sealed in an envelope. If subject needed to be replaced, the replacement subject will receive the same randomization assignment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>ODI is a outcome metrics that is design to assess the severity of disability based on 10 activity categories. ODI is based on 0 to 100% scale, where larger percentage implies worse disability. (There are 5 categories: 0-20%: Minimal disability, 21-40%: Moderate disability, 41-60%: Severe disability, 61-80%: Crippled. 81-100%: Either bed bound or exaggerating symptoms). ODI were measured at baseline (visit1), and at each follow ups visits at visit 2, 3 and 4. Visit 2 and 4 captured post treatment (either 1000 Hz or standard stimulation depending on the randomization) results, and visit 3 captured NPRS after the wash off from the spinal cord stimulation.</description>
