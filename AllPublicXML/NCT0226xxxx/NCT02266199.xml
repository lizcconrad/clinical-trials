  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes operative as well as conservative patients using a questionnaire
      containing items of pain quality. After having completed the questionnaire, the patient is
      interviewed by an assistant. By this way the new questionnaire should be validated.

      In addition the patient´s personal experiences are included and conservative patients can be
      compared to operative patients.

      It is validated whether the questions are formulated comprehensively and the patient
      consequently is able to understand all the different interrogated aspects of the
      questionnaire.

      Exemplarily the patient is asked to express his pain in an analogue scale in various
      situations and which type of pain they experience (for example headache).

      Moreover, it is tested whether there is a relation between the pain and the treatment he
      receives, and whether the patient expressed the need for additional medication.

      Besides, it is asked whether he already took medication before his hospitalisation.

      With help of the interview, which is conducted subsequent to the questionnaire, it is
      verified if the patient understands the aspects. Some of the questions are interrogated in
      depth by additional questions, for example which type of pain he experiences in which
      situation.

      One important aspect is to find out whether the patient is conscious about his medication.

      In order to do so, schedules are used, which are based on the documented patient's history.
