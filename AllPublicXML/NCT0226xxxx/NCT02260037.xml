        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants in the study should be healthy, range from 21 to 50 years of age and
             be within ± 20 % of their normal weight (Broca -Index)

          -  Subsequently each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a
             complete medical examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as
             well as a 12-lead ECG. Haematological, hepatic and renal function tests will be
             carried out in the laboratory (Bioscientia Ingelheim, Germany). The subjects will fast
             for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory evaluations. The above
             mentioned examinations will be performed within 14 days before the first
             administration of the test substance

          -  In accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) and the local legislation all
             volunteers will have given their written informed consent prior to admission to the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastro-intestinal tract (except appendectomy)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             neurological disorders

          -  History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant
             to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less
             than ten half-lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial (≤ one week prior to
             administration or during the trial)

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (≤ two months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60 g/day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (≥ 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the
             trial)

          -  Excessive physical activities (within the last week before the study)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance
