  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to be
      conducted in two parts: the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Confirmation Phase. The Dose
      Escalation Phase will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2
      dose(s) (RP2D) of PT-112 Injection and evaluate its safety and tolerability, PK
      (pharmacokinetic) and preliminary clinical effects. The Dose Confirmation Phase will be a
      cohort expansion at or below the MTD of PT-112 Injection. Subjects who tolerate the drug and
      who do not experience progressive disease may continue to receive PT-112 Injection at the
      discretion of the Principal Investigator for up to 6 cycles. For subjects who tolerate PT-112
      Injection and who experience an objective response or stable disease through 6 cycles, the
      Sponsor will continue to provide PT-112 Injection under a separate mechanism, e.g., an
      extension protocol.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

             provide clinical benefit does not exist or is no longer effective.

          -  Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1 (Appendix 1).

          -  Evaluable disease, either measurable on physical examination or imaging by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1, Appendix 2), or by informative tumor
             marker(s).

          -  Laboratory values at the Screening Visit:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3;
