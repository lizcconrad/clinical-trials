  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Cirrhosis have been shown to have a low aerobic capacity. While supervised
      exercise training has been shown to be an effective intervention to remedy this, there is
      currently no data on home based exercise interventions in this population. This study will
      evaluate the effects of a home based exercise program on the aerobic capacity of enrolled
      early stage liver cirrhosis patients, as well as changes in quality of life, thigh muscle
      thickness, and thigh muscle oxygen consumption.
