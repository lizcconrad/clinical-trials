  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in sensory thresholds and pain thresholds will be measured with quantitative sensory
      testing (QST) before and during hypnotic relaxation in healthy volunteers. Hypnotic
      susceptibility will be assessed before QST.

      QST data before and during hypnosis will be compared. Observed sensory changes will be
      evaluated in relation to the assessed hypnotic susceptibility

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited and tested regarding their hypnotic susceptibility with
      Harvard Group Scale. In a second session QST will be performed on the right hand.Then
      hypnosis will be induced with the fixation method. After that the hypnotherapist will ask
      them to focus their attention on imagining an individual situation of well-being and calmness
      the volunteers had described before hypnosis. Then QST will be performed a second time on the
      same location. Results be compared using student`s ttest.
