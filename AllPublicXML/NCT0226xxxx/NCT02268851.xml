  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will be evaluating the safety and efficacy of a study drug called
      TGR-1202 in combination with a known drug ibrutinib, also known as Imbruvica, as a possible
      treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or Mantle
      Cell Lymphoma (MCL) that has come back or that has not responded to standard treatment.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I and Ib combination clinical trial, which aims to both
      evaluate the safety of an investigational drug combination and also tries to define the
      appropriate dose of the investigational drug to evaluate in later clinical trials.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA
      (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved TGR-1202 in the United States for use in
      MCL/CLL/SLL cancers.

      TGR-1202 is a newly developed drug that may stop cancer cells from growing based on recent
      laboratory experiments. The results from these experiments suggest this drug may help to kill
      cancer cells when coupled with ibrutinib. In this research study, the safety and tolerability
      of TGR-1202 is being investigated to determine the highest dose that can safely be used in
      combination with ibrutinib. The study is also aimed to evaluate whether TGR-1202 has any
      effect on tumor growth (nodal response), and to determine the overall repsonse rate and
      duration of response in patients with CLL/SLL or MCL
