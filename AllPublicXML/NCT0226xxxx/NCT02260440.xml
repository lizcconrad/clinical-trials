  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety,
      and tolerability of Pembrolizumab in combination with azacitidine in subjects with
      chemo-refractory mCRC without any further standard treatment options

      Dosage and regimen for all study periods

        -  Pembrolizumab will be given at 200 mg every 21 days.

        -  Azacitidine will be given at 100 mg daily subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 every 21
           days.

      The first assessment of tumor response will be performed after cycle 3 (9 weeks), and
      thereafter approximately every 9 weeks, every 3 cycles of therapy. The modified RECIST 1.1
      will be used to establish disease response or progression.

      All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common
      Terminology for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE).

    <description>The objective response rate is estimated by the proportion (percentage) of participants with the best response of complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria, with corresponding exact 95% confidence limits being reported. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             qualify for the study.

          5. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the

        <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
