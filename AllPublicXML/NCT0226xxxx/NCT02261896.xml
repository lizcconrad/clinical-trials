  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is
      appropriate when performing a pancreatic cyst fine needle aspiration guided by endoscopic
      ultrasonography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of infection after a pancreatic cyst fine needle aspiration guided by
      endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS-FNA) is not well known. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended
      in clinical guidelines despite the lack of evidence of its usefulness.

      Our hypothesis is that the risk of infection will not be higher with placebo, and risks
      associated to the use of antibiotics might even increase with the use of prophylaxis.

      The main objective of the project is to assess the risk of infection after the procedure and
      to determine whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate. The study is a phase
      IV, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, and non-inferiority trial .
      We have designed a study with two parallel treatment groups. Patients will be randomized to
      the prophylaxis or to the placebo group. All patients will be followed for 21 days or until
      resolution of complications. To evaluate this primary objective with a non inferiority study,
      we have estimated that a total of 218 patients will be needed (109 per group) .

      The main secondary objective is to assess the incidence of complications related to the use
      of antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e. allergic reactions, secondary infections or drug-resistant
      infections).
