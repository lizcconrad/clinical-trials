    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla in
      assessing disease in patients with tumors that have spread to the brain (brain metastases).
      In addition to routine care brain imaging of the brain, this study will include advanced
      multiparametric MRI sequences to measure vascular, cellular, and molecular properties of the
      tumor. Performing extra scans during MRI provides more information about the metastases and
      may better predict treatment response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate pre-treatment measures of biophysical parameters in metastases—obtained using
      advanced, quantitative MRI techniques in patients receiving standard-of-care (SOC) therapy
      for 1-4 brain metastases—with treatment-induced changes in lesion size, time-to-progression
      (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hybrid 3 Tesla MRI examination that includes standard MRI sequences,
      diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), and combined
      dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI/dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI at baseline.
