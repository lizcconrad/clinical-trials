    <textblock>
      Pilot study on 7 subjects in each group (total 21 subjects) to establish the safety and
      feasibility of autologous bone marrow cell transplantation in case of acute complete spinal
      cord injury by each of the following techniques and a corresponding number of controlled
      subjects:

        -  Directly into the injured site with a syringe after exposing the spinal cord.

        -  By Intrathecal injection.

      Intervention : Autologous bone marrow cell: Transplantation of the autologous bone marrow
      cell transplantation through one of the below mentioned techniques: 1. Directly into the
      injured spinal cord site with a syringe after exposing the spinal cord. 2. By Intrathecal
      injection. Number of cells Injected: 200 million cells in 1.8 ml of autologous plasma. In
      case of Direct delivery, the cells were delivered in one sitting at six sites ( 2 above the
      lesion, 2 at the lesion and 2 below the lesion) as 0.3 ml aliquots each. In case of
      Intrathecal injection, the cells were delivered as a single injection of 1.8ml via lumbar
      puncture. Frequency of Injection: Single Total duration of Therapy: The procedure of Bone
      marrow harvesting, enrichment and transplantation was completed in a single setting of
      approximately 2-3 hours. The transplantation procedure in case of Direct delivery took 2 mins
      per injection site that is approximately 12 mins and in case of lumbar puncture the
      transplantation procedure took approximately 2 mins.

      Comparator Agent:Control: control subjects with acute complete spinal cord injury who would
      not receive any bone marrow transplantation.
