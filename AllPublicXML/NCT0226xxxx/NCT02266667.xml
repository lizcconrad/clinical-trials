      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the device &quot;NEMOST&quot; on
      maintaining of the correction of the scoliosis with growth preservation and avoiding
      iterative surgeries.

      Objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the growing device &quot;NEMOST&quot;
      associated to physiotherapy at 12 months postoperatively in patients treated for progressive
      scoliosis and to evaluate its safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of scoliosis in the child remain progressive despite conservative treatment well
      conducted. Nowadays the most used treatment is early surgical treatment by the spinal
      instrumentation without graft called &quot;growing rods&quot;. The use of growing rods in patients with
      progressive scoliosis requires several repeated surgeries (every 6 to 12 months) in order to
      follow the growth of children. These repeated surgeries lead to a significant increased risk
      of complications, that's why many teams around the world have been seeking solutions which
      allow to obtain a rod expansion without repeated surgery.

      The purpose of our study is the evaluation of the use of medical device that will perform the
      correction of scoliosis and, at the same time, preserve the growth of the child's spine. In
      addition, the purpose of clinical investigation is to test the theory that distraction effort
      may be exercised without surgery thanks to traction manoeuvres and physiotherapy. This could
      allow to obtain in patients with progressive scoliosis, correction of spinal deformity while
      avoiding many repeated surgeries. Our reference device is growing rod &quot;NEMOST&quot;. When
      implanted, NEMOST rod is immediately turned on, for correcting and maintaining the correction
      of spinal deformity. After implantation, depending on development in Cobb angle, one or more
      elongations can be made by sliding the notched portion of the rod in its tunnel by a
      distraction effort (traction equipments and physiotherapy).

      Therefore, the growth device NEMOST will allow to continue, on request, the correction of
      spinal deformity by performing a distraction by external manoeuvres on the notched part
      without the need for surgery.
