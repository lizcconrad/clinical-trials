  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a first-in-man CTC-based molecular taxonomy of CRPC in the context of
      novel AR-directed therapies, categorize different patterns of resistance in this disease
      setting, and describe their evolution over time and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will construct a multi-center clinical database of men before and after treatment
      with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and taxane chemotherapy, and will comprehensively
      analyze CTC DNA for copy gains/losses and whole exome sequencing for acquired mutations, CTC
      RNA for AR-variants and evidence of epithelial plasticity, and plasma circulating tumor DNA
      (ctDNA) for whole exome sequencing. Significantly, the investigators will pair the presence
      of key proposed circulating biomarkers of treatment resistance with patient outcomes on these
      systemic therapies for the purpose of developing predictive biomarkers that may have direct
      clinical utility in guiding choice of therapies. It is proposed that specific AR-v's (i.e.
      AR-v7), biomarkers of epithelial plasticity, and microtubule interacting protein variants
      will convey docetaxel resistance and be enriched in men failing abiraterone acetate or
      enzalutamide, while other AR genomic events (AR amplification, AR-v567es, AR mutations, GR
      overexpression) will be responsive to taxane chemotherapy. This work represents a
      first-in-field comprehensive analysis of CTC molecular profiles for the development of a CTC
      molecular taxonomy of mCRPC.

          3. Planned therapy with either enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate within the coming
             6 weeks

          4. Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) at most recent assessment and/or
             documented ongoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy for at lease three months.
