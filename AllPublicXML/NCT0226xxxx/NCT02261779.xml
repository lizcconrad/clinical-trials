  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Longterm disease-free survival (DFS) of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      remains poor. The vast majority of AML patients relapses within two years after start of
      therapy1,2. In Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL, AML M3), all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA;
      Tretinoin) induces differentiation and subsequently clinical remission. So far effective
      differentiation therapy does not exist in other AML subtypes. Recent preclinical data suggest
      that the combinatorial use of ATRA and tranylcypromine (TCP), an irreversible
      Monoamine-Oxidase (MAO) and Lysin-specific demethylase (LSD) inhibitor that also inhibits
      LSD1 (a histone H3 Lysine 4 demethylase), induces leukemia cell differentiation and leukemic
      stem cell exhaustion in vitro and in vivo in non-APL AML subtypes.

      In this Phase I/II study the investigators will explore the feasibility, safety, as well as
      efficacy and of Tretinoin/TCP treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or in
      patients with AML who are not eligible for intensive treatment. Patients will be treated with
      daily increasing doses of TCP (initially 10 mg/day, then +10 mg each day up to 80mg/d). After
      7 days, ATRA will be added at a fixed dose (45 mg/sqm/day). Overall, 16 evaluable patients
      are going to be treated. The primary endpoint is the fraction of patients that achieve CR,
      CRp( complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets), CRi (complete response with
      incomplete recovery of granulocytes) and PR. Secondary endpoints are tolerability, safety as
      well as progression-free survival and overall survival. Serum levels of TCP will be regularly
      analyzed. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed with analyses of the inhibition of LSD1
      by TCP. Further analyses will address the changes in Histone H3 lysine 4 tri demethylase
      (H3K4me3) levels in AML blasts and the differentiation status of AML blasts.

      Taken together, this Phase I/II study will analyze feasibility, pharmacodynamics and
      effectivity of ATRA and TCP as differentiation therapy in AML.
