  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EOS® imaging system, a new imaging modality which offers low dose, weight bearing and
      full body X-ray imaging, requires a new standing position where patients put their hands and
      forearms on the wall vertically for stability. Although this method provides enough support
      for the patients during the extended X-ray acquisition time, its impact on the postural
      balance and sagittal profile of the spine and sacro-pelvic parameters has not been evaluated.
      The goal of this study is to identify the impact of patients' arm positioning on the sagittal
      profile and postural balance of the patient and subsequently propose a standardized method
      for full spine X-ray acquisition in the EOS® imaging system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spino-pelvic sagittal analysis and postural assessment are important parameters in adolescent
      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treatment and surgical planning.The three-dimensional (3D) shape
      of the spine is impacted by the patients' posture particularly in adolescents with flexible
      spinal curves. The latter highlights the importance of the patients' positioning during X-ray
      acquisition in order to avoid any misleading measurements that may adversely impact
      monitoring and surgical curve correction in AIS.

      Participating subjects will undergo two bi-planar X-rays in different positions. The
      positions will be instructed by the means of graphical presentation and verbal explanation by
      the radiology technician. The first standing position in the EOS® imaging system for full
      spinal X-ray acquisition will consist of putting both hands and forearms in front of the
      subject on the wall vertically. In the second position, knuckles are loosely placed on
      ipsi-lateral clavicles. Bi-planar X-rays will be taken in the EOS® imaging system for both
      positions.

      Moreover to compare the postural balance of the patient in the two described positions, a
      pressure mat will be placed in the EOS® system. The pressure mat will be calibrated with the
      EOS® system and permits to identify the position of the center of pressure (COP) with respect
      to the anatomical landmarks. The magnitude of pressure under the patients' feet will be
      measured during each X-ray and compared.

    <description>The EOS® imaging system is a low dose, 3-dimensional imaging system that provides weight bearing images which provide visual information with respect to the interaction between the joints and the rest of the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine, hips and legs. The imaging system is used for clinical purposes with additional images captured as part of this study to collect data from subjects in two different arm positions during imaging.</description>

    <ipd_description>Identifiable pressure mat data from select subjects that is recorded during this study will be shared with investigators at this institution working on another approved study which requires pre-surgical pressure mat data. Many subjects in the companion study will have already undergone surgery, yet none in the current study will have at the time pressure mat data is recorded. Thus this data will be shared. Data will be stored in a password protected file on a secure shared drive and is only accessible by IRB-approved members of the current and companion study teams.</ipd_description>

          <title>Impact of the Patients' Arm Positioning on Clinical Evaluation of Bi-planar Spinal X-rays Using the EOS System - Pressure Mat Parameters</title>
          <description>Spinal (coronal and sagittal) and sacro-pelvic parameters were used to evaluate the equivalence between the spinal and pelvic parameters in the two arm positions. Images were only recorded during the wall and clavicle position, not during the natural standing position. Pressure mat parameters were recorded for both arm positions and compared to the natural standing position (arms hanging on either side).</description>
          <population>Each enrolled subject completed bi-planar full spinal x-rays in each of the two positions and pressure mat recording in the two positions and the natural standing position.</population>

          <description>Two bi-planar full spinal X-ray were taken using the EOS® imaging system with subjects standing in two different positions. The first x-ray was taken while the subject's hands and forearms in front of them on the wall vertically. A second image was taken while the subject's knuckles loosely placed on ipsi-lateral clavicles. A pressure mat recorded the magnitude of pressure under the subjects' feet during each set of images.</description>
