  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to investigate the relative bioavailability of concomitant administration of
      clopidogrel and telmisartan (Test 1) relative to the bioavailability of SR26334 alone
      (Reference 1), and relative to the bioavailability of telmisartan alone (Reference 2). And to
      investigate the bioavailability of SR26334 following administration of clopidogrel 30 minutes
      after intake of telmisartan (Test 2) relative to the bioavailability of SR26334 alone
      (Reference 1), and relative to the bioavailability of telmisartan alone (Reference 2)
