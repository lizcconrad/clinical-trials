      This study will develop and evaluate the feasibility of a cost-effective, more accessible
      alternative treatment approach for insomnia. Traditional CBT, including the behavioral,
      cognitive, and educational aspects, will be operationalized and transformed for an Internet
      intervention system, so individuals can access a personalized treatment any time, at their
      own convenience. Phase 1 of this study will involve developing the web program. The
      investigators research team and collaborators has extensive experience developing such web
      interventions, as well as considerable experience with insomnia. Phase 2 will be a large
      randomized controlled trial testing the Internet intervention compared to passive patient
      education/sleep hygiene. Two hundred individuals with insomnia will be assessed pre and post
      the six week treatment program. It is hypothesized that the Internet intervention will
      promote improvements in sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning. If successful, the current
      project may result in improved implementation of a low-threshold treatment for a common
      disorder with devastating impact on both individual and socioeconomic outcomes
