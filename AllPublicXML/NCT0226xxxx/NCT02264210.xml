      This phase II trial studies how well icotinib works in treating patients with completely
      resected stage IB NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy have shown little evidence of survival benefit in patients with stages
      IB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection. Epidermal growth factor
      receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with EGFR
      mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group
      of Chinese scientists and clinician. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had
      non-inferiority efficacy to gefitinib with better safety. This study is studying icotinib to
      see how well it works in treating patients with fully resected stage IB NSCLC harboring EGFR
      mutation.
