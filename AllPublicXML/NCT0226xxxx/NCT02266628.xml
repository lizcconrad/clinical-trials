      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ≥60 years of age who are ambulatory and live in the community or in
             residential facilities which provide minimal assistance, such that the subject is
             primarily responsible for self-care and activities of daily living. Subjects may have
             one or more chronic medical diagnoses, but should be clinically stable as assessed by:

               -  Absence of changes in medical therapy within one month due to treatment failure
                  or toxicity,

               -  Absence of medical events qualifying as serious adverse events (SAEs) within two
                  months, and

               -  Absence of known, current, and life-limiting diagnoses which render survival to
                  completion of the protocol unlikely in the opinion of the investigator.

          2. Willing and able (on both a physical and cognitive basis) to give informed consent
             prior to study enrollment.

          3. Able to comply with study requirements; including access to transportation for study
             visits.

          4. Access to inbound and outbound telephone communication with caregivers and study
             staff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic / device)
             within 45 days before the planned date of the Day 0 vaccination.

          2. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination, or Guillain-Barré syndrome
             within 6 weeks of any prior influenza immunization.

          3. Received any vaccine other than an inactivated influenza vaccine in the 4 weeks
             preceding the study vaccination; or any RSV vaccine at any time.

          4. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as
             determined by history and/or physical examination.

          5. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥10mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          6. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          7. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature ≥38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

          8. Known disturbance of coagulation.

          9. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.

         10. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric
             conditions deemed likely to impair the quality of study compliance or safety
             reporting).
