    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, investigator initiated study that will prospectively examine
      treatment strategies and outcomes of patients who underwent clinically-indicated Near
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The information collected will be used to determine the
      frequency of NIRS imaging performed at the participating sites and to examine the clinical
      outcomes of the NIRS-detected Lipid Core Plaques (LCPs).

    <time_frame>1 to 15 years following clinically indicated Near InfraRed Spectroscopy imaging</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for both hypotheses is the incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Major adverse cardiac events include the following:
cardiac death
cardiac arrest
acute coronary syndrome
stent thrombosis, repeat coronary angiography
coronary revascularization (either by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery).
rehospitalization for progressive angina, attributed to a non-culprit lesion secondary to significant fixed, non-reversible (not-spasm related) lesion progression of more than 20% from the baseline study (confirmed by either serial angiography or by necropsy).
Events will be classified as events occurring at the site of stent implantation and events occurring at previously untreated lesions. Moreover, analyses will be performed on a per patient and per LCP basis.</description>
