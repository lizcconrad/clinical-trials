      It has been argued that social relationships are important to health and well-being. This
      study will investigate links between social networks and cardiovascular disease risk factors
      in South Asians, the second fastest growing ethnic group in the US and one with disparate
      rates of coronary heart disease. Identifying and understanding the links between social
      networks and cardiovascular disease is key to the development and testing of family- and
      community-level prevention interventions for minorities.

      understanding the links between social networks and cardiovascular disease is key to the
