  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in cancer patients is estimated to be as high as 90% and results in physical and
      psychological disability. Behavioral interventions that increase patients' confidence in
      their ability to manage their pain have been shown to be beneficial. Behavioral interventions
      for cancer pain teach patients how their thoughts and feelings can influence their pain and
      specific strategies (e.g., relaxation) for decreasing cancer pain. However, despite
      guidelines recommending such interventions be used in the care of cancer patients with pain,
      they are not routinely used. A critical barrier to the use of behavioral interventions is
      that patients have difficulties attending appointments which are typically offered at the
      medical center during normal business hours. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies provide new
      opportunities to decrease such barriers. The investigators have developed a new mHealth
      approach that may increase the use of behavioral cancer pain interventions and ultimately
      lead to greater use of interventions that can decrease pain and disability.

      The investigators propose to test an approach that uses mHealth technologies to deliver a
      behavioral cancer pain intervention to patients in their home using a tablet computer (e.g.,
      iPad) and video-conferencing (e.g., Skype). The investigators will randomly assign 160 cancer
      patients with breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer pain to receive either mHealth
      Pain Coping Skills Training system (mPCST) or to receive a traditional in-person pain coping
      skills training intervention protocol (PCST-trad) at the medical center. The investigators
      will test whether the mPCST is more accessible to patients than PCST-trad. The investigators
      expect that mPCST, compared to PCST-trad, will: a) be more feasible meaning that more
      patients will complete it in a timely manner; b) create less burden meaning it is easier for
      patients physically, emotionally, and financially to participate; c) increase engagement
      meaning that patients will practice skills more and have more understanding of the material;
      and d) be more overall acceptable to patients. the investigators also expect that patients
      who find this intervention more feasible, less burdensome, more engaging, and more acceptable
      will be more likely to experience decreased pain, physical disability, and psychological
      disability, and increased confidence in their ability to manage their pain.

      The investigators' goal is to use mHealth technologies to facilitate wide-spread use of
      behavioral cancer pain interventions. Increased use of mHealth behavioral cancer pain
      interventions will particularly benefit patients living far from medical centers (e.g.,
      rural), experiencing cancer-related physical challenges, and facing other practical barriers
      (e.g., transportation, work) to in-person interventions. These outcomes could lead to future
      work evidencing that mHealth behavioral interventions could be applied to other areas of
      quality of life in cancer patients (e.g., fatigue) and/or in other samples of patients with
      persistent pain (e.g., arthritis).
