      The objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose of combination of dovitinib
      and imatinib in phase I study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      combination of dovitinib and imatinib could lead to additive or synergistic effect in
      patients who had failure of standard TKI therapies including imatinib, sunitinib, and/or
      regorafenib. In this phase I-II study of dovitinib plus imatinib, we aim to determine a
      recommended dose of dovitinib plus imatinib and to evaluate the safety and activity of the
      combination at the recommended dose as a 3rd or more line of treatment in metastatic or
      unresectable GIST.
