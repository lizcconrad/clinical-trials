  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to determine the effects of a new program of PEP'C
      &quot;PEP'C with constant load and intermittent recovery&quot; (PEP'C-R) on endurance parameters of
      older seniors.

      The study hypothesis: the investigators propose that PEP'C-R training offers a significant
      improvement in endurance parameters for older seniors.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the effects of PEP'C-R on maximal
      cardio-respiratory function, FMD (Flow-mediated dilation), PWV (pulse wave velocity),
      systolic and diastolic heart function, body composition (measured by impedance), biological,
      functional and cognitive functioning and quality of life.

    <description>Preliminary session of calibration and tolerance: Test of Borg: determination of VT1 for 10 minutes, 3 min pedaling at 25 W and then 20 minutes pedaling on VT1 determined during the exercise test (ET) -10%.
Session 1: 30 min of pedaling at constant load VT1 determined during exercise testing (EE) - 10%.
Session 2 Session 17: increase in the burden of BASE (5 BASE * 5 min: 25 min) by 10% and decrease in relation to the load of the PIC (5 PIC * 1 min: 5 min) to get a cumulative charge of the same session. Changes in heart rate (HR) determine the evolution of sustained loads: a decrease of 10 bpm in heart rate leads to an increase by 10% in the intensity of the base (PIC load remains constant).
Session 18 = Session 1.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will not follow the intervention PEP'C-R. They will continue their usual activities for 9.5 weeks and will be assessed before and after this period. After the study, they will be offered the benefit of the conventional program of the PEP'C.</description>
