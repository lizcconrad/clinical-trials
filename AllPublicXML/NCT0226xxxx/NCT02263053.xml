  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) is one of the most complex joints in the individual. It is
      composed of the mandibular condyle is positioned within the glenoid fossa of the temporal
      bone, and the articular disk that separates these two bones. The normal biomechanics of the
      TMJ is the concave / convex relationship between the condyles and the articular disc. The
      movements of the TMJ joint are: mandibular depression and elevation (opening and closing of
      the mouth), mandibular protrusion and retraction, and lateral deviations. The DTM is a
      musculoskeletal disorder of the masticatory system that affects over 25% of the population.
      Physical therapy can be adopted this treatment in order to relieve musculoskeletal pain,
      reduce inflammation and restore normal motor functions. The physical therapy interventions
      taken include electrotherapy, exercise therapy, acupuncture and manual therapy. Overall
      objective is to assess the immediate effects of previous mobilization versus flow amplitude
      of mandibular depression in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction. The type of study
      will be a randomized study of two parallel groups balanced distribution (1: 1) and
      double-blind. The research will be conducted in the Laboratory of Human Movement Analysis of
      Physiotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Ceará. The study population will
      consist of residents in the city of Fortaleza-CE individuals who voluntarily seek to
      participate in the study due to symptoms of TMD. Data, anthropometry, application of Research
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders will be collected. The physiotherapist
      responsible for the assessment before and after the interventions will be blind with respect
      to the distribution of the treatment groups. The patient will also be blind, because you will
      not know whether or caudal anterior mobilization was performed. Randomization codes are
      generated by computer using Random Allocation Software (version 1.0.0) at a ratio of 1: 1 by
      a researcher not involved in the data collection. These codes will be placed in sealed,
      opaque envelopes being numbered consecutively, which will ensure the covert allocation of
      study participants. Our data are considered confidential as joint property of the parties
      involved.

    <description>The caliper is a measuring instrument that inform the millimetric values of mandibular depression, as measured the distance between the edges of the incisors of the maxilla and mandible. Three measurements of the active mouth opening will be held, where the individual experiencing pain, the measurement will be the beginning of it, if he does not feel pain, be gauged from the maximum amplitude of movement. Soon after the arithmetic mean of the measurements will be made.</description>
