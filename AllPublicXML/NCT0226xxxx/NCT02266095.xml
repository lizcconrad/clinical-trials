  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The oval-8 splint has been developed for many uses in finger pathology and trauma. It has
      not, however, been used to treat thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint arthritis. When treating
      thumb CMC joint osteoarthritis, splinting is a very widely used and supported treatment
      option for non-operative management. Many studies have been performed showing that thumb
      spica splinting in abduction with either a hand based or forearm based splint improves pain.
      This study aims to compare the effects of a novel splinting approach with oval-8 splints for
      the hyperextended thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint vs. standardized treatment with Tee Pee
      splinting (hand based thumb spica) or forearm thumb spica splinting on pain and function of
      patients with thumb CMC joint arthritis.

      This is a pilot study will address the following hypothesis: Splinting of the hyperextended
      thumb IP joint with oval-8 splints will lead to increased DASH scores and decreased pain on
      physical exam compared to splinting with thumb spica splints in patients with thumb CMC
      arthritis.

      After informed consent is obtained and the patient has met all of the inclusion criteria and
      non of the exclusion criteria, the patient will be assigned a study ID number. The patient
      will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1:1 to a splint treatment with either a forearm thumb
      spica splint, Tee-Pee splint or oval- 8 splint at the time of initial visit to Orthopaedic
      Hand clinic (week 1 visit). The patient will be fitted and provided with the appropriate
      splint by Orthopaedic physician.

      Baseline radiographs (3 views anterior-posterior, lateral and oblique) and data points will
      be gathered from initial clinic history and physical, as performed per normal clinical
      protocol: arthritis grade, hand involved, dominant hand, interphalangeal (IP) extension, MCP
      extension, pinch strength, grip strength, pain scale, location of pain, DASH scores,
      analgesic use, and work/hobby activity. Additionally, demographic data including age, gender
      and race/ethnicity will be gathered and patient will be asked to repeat pinch and grip tests
      with study splint applied and asked to repeat assessment of pain scale.

    <measure>DASH Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH is scored in two components. The disability/symptom questions (30 items scored 1-5) includes the following scoring categories: no difficulty - unable, not at all - extremely, not limited at all - unable, none - extreme, no difficulty - so much difficulty that I can't sleep, and strongly disagree - strongly agree. At least 27 out of 30 items must be completed for a score to be calculated. The assigned values for all completed responses are summed and averaged, producing a score out of five.
The second section high performance sport/music or work section. This section of 4 items scored 1-5 includes no difficulty - unable, scoring category. The scoring calculations are the same for this area.</description>

    <measure>Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The general pain scale ranges 0 - 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible pain. Pinch pain and Grip pain will the measured with and without the splint. The ranges are the same for all pain scales.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to wear their assigned splint 24 hours per day with removal for hygiene care. Follow-up appointments will occur at week 4 and 12. Each visit will include a clinical examination, splint assessment for continued appropriate fit and evaluation of skin for irritation or breakdown.
Standard non-operative therapy includes activity modification, therapy, NSAIDS, splinting (thumb spica or Tee-Pee). Oval-8 splints are not commonly used for treatment of thumb CMC arthritis.
Procedures will be undertaken to minimize patient discomfort. Participants will be instructed to continue with range of motion exercises to 2-5th digits and elbow to try to avoid stiffness.</description>
