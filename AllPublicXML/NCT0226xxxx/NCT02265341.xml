    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well ponatinib hydrochloride works in treating patients
      with biliary cancer that has spread to other places in the body and that have alterations
      (fusions) in a gene known as fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Ponatinib
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (confirmed complete or partial response or stable
      disease for 4 or more cycles) of ponatinib (ponatinib hydrochloride) in fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR) aberrant advanced biliary cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression free survival, overall survival, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)
      response rate of these patients.

      II. To estimate the adverse event profile of ponatinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish preliminary correlations between FGFR2 fusions and evidence of any clinical
      benefit.

      II. Assess preliminary evaluation of FGFR2 pathway perturbation with ponatinib. III. To
      describe patient-reported health-related quality of life and symptoms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for at least 2
      years.

    <measure>Clinical benefit rate, which includes confirmed tumor response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or stable disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A confirmed tumor response is defined to be either a CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart. The proportion of clinical benefit rate will be estimated by the number of patients with clinical benefit (confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD for 4 or more cycles) divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A confidence interval for the true clinical benefit rate will be calculated using the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CA 19-9 response, defined to be a &gt;= 50% reduction from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The CA 19-9 response rate will be estimated by the number of CA 19-9 responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A confidence interval will be calculated based on the binomial distribution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of progression-free survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

    <measure>Survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient-reported outcomes (quality of life and symptoms), assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, EORTC QLQ-BIL21, Skindex-16, and Bowel Function Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Uniscale assessment of overall quality of life will be used. The Was It Worth It questionnaire will determine patient's satisfaction with the study. Scale score trajectories over time will be examined using stream plots and mean plots with standard deviation error bars overall. Changes from baseline at each cycle will be statistically tested using paired t-tests, and standardized response means will be interpreted using Cohen's (1988) cut-offs. Correlation between outcomes will employ Pearson and/or Spearman correlations at individual time points.</description>
