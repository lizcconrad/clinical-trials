        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study

          -  All participants in the study should be healthy males, aged 18-50 years old inclusive

          -  All participants should be within (+- 20%) of their ideal body weight (Broca-Index)

          -  Non-smokers (subject who have never smoked) or ex-smoker for at least one year with a
             smoking history, no greater than five pack-years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes per day
             for 1 year)

          -  Ability to comply with the concomitant therapy restrictions as detailed in Clinical
             Trial Protocol (CTP)

          -  Subjects will be off all prescription drugs. O.T.C. drugs must be discontinued for at
             least two weeks prior to participation in the study. If throughout the study, subjects
             need any O.T.C. medication, the investigator will call the clinical monitor and this
             will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Restrictions for different medications are
             described in CTP

          -  Subjects will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon
             complete medical history, full physical examination, chest-x-ray (if not done in
             previous 6 months), ECG and clinical laboratory tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Viral respiratory tract infection or a respiratory tract infection within the six
             weeks preceding dosing with study medication

          -  Small or difficult to locate arm or hand veins that would impair the clinicians
             ability to draw blood samples or to place a venous catheter

          -  Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence (absence of dependency for 10 years)
             or who drink more than 60 g of alcohol per day, history of significant allergic
             reactions to drugs or sensitivity to aspirin or positive drug screen

          -  Use of investigational new drug in the preceding month or six half-lives (whichever is
             greater) prior to the first screen at Visit 1

          -  Donation of blood during the month preceding Visit 1

          -  Subjects receiving hyposensitization therapy who are not on a stable dose for the last
             three months before Visit 1

          -  Subjects with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Subjects with diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with
             psychiatric disorders

          -  Subjects with known history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Subjects with chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  Subjects with history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is
             deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Subjects with eosinophilia &gt; 7 %

          -  Subjects who received any other drugs, which might influence the results of the trial
             during the weeks prior to dosing with study medication

          -  Subjects who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports)
             within the last week before dosing with study medication
