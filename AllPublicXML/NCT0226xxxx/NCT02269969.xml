  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective antimicrobial use in the burn population is important since this population is at
      an increased risk for infections during their stay in hospital as a result of their burn
      injury. Tobramycin is an antibiotic that has activity against common burn wound associated
      pathogens, such as Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and its use is becoming increasingly relevant due
      to the increased incidence of bacterial resistance to currently utilized antibiotics. Once
      daily dosing of tobramycin has been safely and effectively used in the majority of infected
      patients for many years with the proposed benefits of optimized antibacterial activity and
      reduced nephrotoxicity compared to traditional dosing. But, the once daily dosing regimen has
      yet to be validated in the burn population. The purpose of this study is to validate the
      plausibility of once daily tobramycin dosing in the burn population with intent to determine
      a safe, effective, and efficient dosing regimen for this population.
