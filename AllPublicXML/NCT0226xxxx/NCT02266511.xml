      The objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of two batches of Flomax® 0.4
      mg capsules in healthy male subjects. One is a commercial scale batch produced at the Nishine
      facility, and the other is a batch, of equal size, produced at the Norman II facility

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consents, as evidenced by signature on an Informed Consent
             Form approved by the investigational review board (IRB) following a full explanation
             of the nature and purpose of the study

          -  Be a healthy male of any race between 18 and 40 years of age

             examination, and vital signs with no significant orthostatic blood pressure change,
             which is defined as no more than a 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure on
             assuming and maintaining the standing position for 3 minutes after being supine for at
             least 5 minutes. There should be no clinically significant symptoms associated with
             the orthostatic blood pressure testing procedure

          -  Have cardiovascular system that is within normal limits based on history, physical
             examination, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Have a negative test for ethanol by breathalyzer

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, agree to abide by the
             study restrictions, and agree to return for the required assessments

             would ordinarily maintain stability or syncope

          -  Have any medical or laboratory abnormalities (liver function tests, blood urea
             nitrogen, and creatinine should not be outside the reference range for the clinical
             laboratory). Any subject who enters into the study with laboratory abnormalities must
             be approved by the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment

          -  Have abnormal alpha-1-acid glycoprotein values (i.e., values greater than 120 mg/dL)

          -  Have any abnormality of the ECG or a history of a documented myocardial infarction
             (electrocardiographic changes, serum enzymes increases, and hospitalization) during
             the prior 6 months, or evidence of any myocardial infarction on an ECG

                  than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL)

               -  Severe cardiovascular disease (coarctation of the aorta, severe cardiac failure,
                  second or third degree heart block, or severe angina)

          -  Have a history of liver disease or any physical findings suggestive of liver disease

          -  Have smoked within the last 3 months or be known as or be suspected as an alcohol

             immunodeficiency syndrome, whether spontaneously acquired, congenital, or iatrogenic
             (These syndromes are characterized by unusual susceptibility to infection [bacterial,
             viral, or fungal], the occurrence of autoimmune disease, and lymphoreticular
