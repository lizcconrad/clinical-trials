  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is evaluate whether it's feasible to give radiation
      therapy using an MRI-guided adaptive technique. MRI-guided adaptive radiation therapy
      involves the adjustment or re-planning of treatment day by day while the participant is
      receiving treatment. The adaptive technique has previously been used in a different fashion
      to adjust the treatment plan after the fact, but using MRI scanning to re-plan treatment
      while the participant is still on the table is a new way of using the adaptive technique.
      This may allow doctors to use more radiation to treat the tumor while better protecting
      normal tissues. A special radiation treatment machine incorporates both an MRI scanner and
      radiation treatment devices so that the planning and treatment can be done using the same
      machine.

      In this trial, the feasibility of delivering online, adaptive MRI-guided stereotactic body
      radiation therapy for oligometastatic disease using a novel, integrated Co-60-MRI machine
      will be evaluated. To best assess this technology, we will focus on three specific
      oligometastatic disease sites that have historically highlighted the limitations of SBRT.
      Specifically, we will enroll patients with oligometastatic disease of the central thorax,
      liver, and non-liver abdomen to receive adaptive, MRI-guided SBRT with MRI simulation and MRI
      treatment gating. Patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By
      adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, expected toxicity will be within the current
      standard of care, but allow adaptation based on daily anatomic changes. The prescription dose
      will be determined based on above hard normal tissue constraints, and capped at 15 Gy per
      fraction. Although our long-term goal will be to achieve improved local control and
      disease-free survival with reduced toxicity, the present study will be driven by short-term
      goals of demonstrating feasibility of an on-table adaptive approach, which has never
      previously been reported.
