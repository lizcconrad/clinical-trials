  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyse the sensitivity and specificity of circulating
      endothelial cells to predict irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with
      congenital heart disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      predict to recruit 100 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)associated with
      CHD，under the commitment of the children's parents，take 3-4ml central venous blood before the
      corrective surgery，then calculate the number of the circulating endothelial cells by flow
      cytometer AND detect the expression of micro RNAs to screen out the biomarker，through the 6
      months follow-up, separated the reversible and irreversible PAH,then to carry on the
      statistics.
