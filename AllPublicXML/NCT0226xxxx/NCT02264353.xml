  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with a low
      arousal threshold may wake up too early during a respiratory event, before upper airway
      muscles can be activated to achieve stable ventilation. Thus, strategies to manipulate the
      respiratory arousal threshold could potentially improve the quality of sleep and sleep
      disordered breathing. Agents that raise arousal threshold are therefore likely to benefit
      some patients with OSA. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of
      the arousal threshold in OSA, determine which patients might benefit from a raised arousal
      threshold, and test this hypothesis by using pharmacological manipulation of the arousal
      threshold to achieve this goal.

      This study is a pilot study. The investigators will test whether donepezil has important
      effects on the arousal threshold and on the apnea hypopnea index.

      Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

      Eligible participants will undergo overnight polysomonography as described below and will
      receive either donepezil (10 mg immediately prior to sleep) or placebo (in random order)
      followed roughly 14 days later with placebo or donepezil. This aim will allow us to test the
      impact of donepezil on the apnea hypopnea index. The study plans to enroll approximately 30
      subjects.

      The change in apnea hypopnea index as well as arousal thresholds/upper airway mechanics will
      be compared in the donepezil groups with the placebo group.
