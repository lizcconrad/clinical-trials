  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be looking at MAO-A density before and after seven weeks of treatment
      with an antidepressant and dietary supplement. MAO-A is an enzyme that breaks down brain
      chemicals that regulate mood. MAO-A density is elevated in patients with major depressive
      episodes (MDE) secondary to major depressive disorder (MDD). Many remain treatment resistant
      with common antidepressant treatments and we think it may be due to poor targeting of brain
      pathologies. We want to test if adding a dietary supplement may normalize MAO-A.

      All subjects are getting the combined treatment of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      and the dietary supplement. There are two possible selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      treatments but the dietary supplement remains the same. No subjects are receiving the
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor alone and no subjects are receiving the dietary
      supplement alone. The dietary supplement is called n-acetylcysteine.
