  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, an estimated 860 000 patients are affected by Alzheimer Disease (AD) which
      represents, as in other developed countries, a major public health issue. In many cases, AD
      diagnosis is uncertain and its clinical evolution unpredictable. The exactitude of the
      diagnosis is however particularly important in the perspective of the validation and use of
      new therapeutic strategies in AD. Detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnosis biomarkers
      fell short in the detection, of atypical/mixed cases, of some differential diagnosis, and in
      differentiating rapid or slow clinical evolutions. Hence, CSF analysis gives a unique
      opportunity to detect and validate biomarkers in many neurological disorders. Nevertheless,
      in medical practice, CSF biological analysis is currently limited to a small number of
      analytes.Quantitative and targeted mass spectrometry, especially operated in the Multiple
      reaction monitoring mode (MRM), represents an alternative to immunodetection and could be
      used to detect specific biomarkers in complex matrices such as plasma by specifically
      discriminating the proteotypic peptides corresponding to each proteins. Mass spectrometry has
      also the ability to distinguish and quantify isotopically labelled and unlabeled selected
      targets. This ability was used in a publication by the group of R. Bateman (Washington
      University, St Louis, USA) who could, after administering stable isotope-labelled leucine,
      evaluate Ab synthesis and clearance in humans. This approach has an enormous potential to
      study the metabolism of proteins within the human CNS and consequently help in the
      understanding and diagnosis of neurological disorders.The main objective of this program is
      set up a targeted quantitative mass spectrometry method for existing and stable
      isotope-labelled CSF biomarkers in the neurological field; exploit this approach for
      diagnostic purpurses and to gain knowledge in the pathophysiology of diseases.
