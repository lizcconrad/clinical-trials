    <textblock>
      PRIMe is a prospective, case-only trial designed to measure the impact of MammaPrint on
      physician chemotherapy intention in the two discordant groups (ET/POOR, CT/GOOD) in stage 1
      and 2 HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients. The design also provides for
      assessment of several important secondary indicators. Eligible patients will have their tumor
      sample analyzed for MammaPrint, BluePrint and TargetPrint. Patients cannot start treatment
      before the MammaPrint result is received and taken into consideration for the adjuvant
      treatment plan.

        The study population will comprise patients for whom the investigator will advise either
        endocrine therapy or chemotherapy + endocrine therapy. Patients confirmed to be low/high
        risk by the gene signature will receive the respective treatment. Patients with discordant
        results will be investigated for investigator's chemotherapy intention after MammaPrint
        results are available.
