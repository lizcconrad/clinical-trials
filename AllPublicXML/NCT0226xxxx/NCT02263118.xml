  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to m-health platforms promoting
      recommended breastfeeding practices was effective in transmitting the exclusive breastfeeding
      message to participant mothers, and in improving weight evolution of infants.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Changes in Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>December 2013 - May 2014, 23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Specifically, we were interested in: the number of participants who switched from an incorrect to a correct knowledge regarding exclusive breastfeeding during the experiment (learned the message); the number of participants who had a correct knowledge but switched to an incorrect one during the experiment (forgot the message); the number of participants who had an incorrect knowledge and kept it until the end of the experiment (continued to be unaware); the number of participants who had a correct knowledge and kept it until the end of the experiment (remembered the message).</description>

    <measure>Number of Text-messages Exchanged in Virtual Communities</measure>
    <time_frame>December 2013 - May 2014, 23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We were interested in the activity of virtual communities in terms of sent text-messages.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Weight-for-Age Z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at December 2013 and 23 weeks later in May 2014</time_frame>
    <description>We used the World Health Organization Anthro software (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/) to calculate z-scores for the weight-for-age anthropometric indicator of participants' infants at the beginning and at the end of the project. The software is based on the WHO Child Growth Standards and allowed to compare measurements of infants to the normal growth standards. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. The indicator is particularly useful to detect abnormal growth patterns in infants' development. For instance, an infant whose weight falls in the -2 z-score for the weight-for-age anthropometric indicator is underweight. Below -3, the child is severely underweight. Similarly, a child whose weight-for-age is above a +1 z-score may have a growth problem.
We report the mean change of the z-scores for the weight-for-age anthropomorphic indicator of participants' babies.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Weight-for-Age Z-score</title>
        <description>We used the World Health Organization Anthro software (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/) to calculate z-scores for the weight-for-age anthropometric indicator of participants' infants at the beginning and at the end of the project. The software is based on the WHO Child Growth Standards and allowed to compare measurements of infants to the normal growth standards. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. The indicator is particularly useful to detect abnormal growth patterns in infants' development. For instance, an infant whose weight falls in the -2 z-score for the weight-for-age anthropometric indicator is underweight. Below -3, the child is severely underweight. Similarly, a child whose weight-for-age is above a +1 z-score may have a growth problem.
We report the mean change of the z-scores for the weight-for-age anthropomorphic indicator of participants' babies.</description>
