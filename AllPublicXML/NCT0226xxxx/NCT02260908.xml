  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Victims of trauma with severe head injury who have bled into their brains are at high risk of
      developing blood clots in their legs. These blood clots can break off and travel through the
      bloodstream to the lungs, resulting in death. Blood thinners can be given to patients to
      prevent blood clots from developing but this can leave patients at risk for additional
      bleeding in the brain, causing further damage or death. The earlier blood thinners are
      started, the more effective they are at preventing blood clots. In addition, some patients
      with severe head injury who have bled into their brains will develop further bleeding even if
      they do not receive blood thinners. Even though a growing body of research has shown that the
      majority of bleeding in the brain stops within the first 24 hours after injury and that it is
      safe to start blood thinners as early as 24 hours after injury, doctors are still waiting
      longer than 4 days to start blood thinners in these patients over concerns of worsening
      bleeding. In Canada, almost half of the patients with severe head injury do not receive blood
      thinners until at least five days after injury. Delays in starting blood thinners appear to
      put patients at increased risk of developing blood clots, unnecessarily. This study will
      compare the benefits of starting low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), a type of blood
      thinner, early (36 to 48 hours after injury) versus the current practice (waiting until the
      6th day after being injured) in preventing blood clots in patients who have bled into their
      brains after severe head injury. The investigators believe that starting LMWH earlier will be
      more effective in preventing blood clots without worsening any bleeding when compared to
      waiting to start blood thinners. This study is called OPTTICH (OPtimal timing of
      Thromboprophylaxis in Traumatic IntraCranial Haemorrhage) and will be the largest Canadian
      investigator-initiated randomized control trial on blood clot prevention in trauma patients
      with severe head injury who have bled into their brains.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proximal lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed by bilateral lower extremity compression ultrasound (US).</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 60 days or until hospital discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasounds will be performed within 72 hours of enrollment as well as twice weekly when in ICU and weekly thereafter. Non-compressibility of 1 or more proximal deep venous segments on compression US will be considered diagnostic. Each segment will be assessed as fully compressible, partially compressible, not compressible, or not well-visualized. All positive US will be recorded and stratified into above-knee (proximal DVT) or below-knee (distal DVT). Patients who have both proximal and distal DVT will be classified as having proximal DVT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-intracranial bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 60 days or until hospital discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Non-intracranial bleeding events will be recorded and classified as either major or minor bleeding, according to a modified bleeding assessment tool adapted to our patient population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 60 days or until hospital discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who develop clinical suspicion of PE will have a helical CT chest. Pulmonary embolism will be diagnosed by the presence of an intraluminal filling defect detected in either the main, lobar or segmental branches or the pulmonary artery. Patients with a high probability of PE on clinical grounds but with negative CT chest will undergo a ventilation-perfusion scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intracranial haemorrhage progression (IHP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 60 days or until hospital discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>If a patient develops clinical evidence of neurological deterioration, an emergent head CT scan will be performed. The CT scan will be reviewed by the blinded attending neuroradiologist. A comparison to the previous CT scan will be made and assessed for evidence of IHP. Intracranial haemorrhage progression will be defined as either 1) the development of a new haematoma, 2) any enlargement of an existing haematoma by an attending neuroradiologist's CT report, or 3) any progression of haematoma by the Marshall Head CT Classification System.</description>
