      Study to focus on the defining and managing the neuropsychological abnormalities of myotonic
      dystrophy and to find out if the neuropsychological abnormalities have any correlation with
      changes seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the prevalence of DM, and assistance from The Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation (letter),
      we anticipate full recruitment of 8-17 year old subjects with DM1. The genetic counselor will
      help recruit 20 DM1 subjects, and 20 comparably aged controls, all of whom will complete MRI
      and neuropsychological tests. We anticipate full participation in evoked potential and blood
      tests, but estimate 30% will permit a lumbar puncture for CSF evaluation - done at the LPCH
      Ambulatory Procedure Unit with sedation as necessary. In total 40 MRIs will be done over 2
      years, or 20 annually. Testing of Subjects

      All neuropsychological evaluations will be performed in the morning in attempt to standardize
      wakefulness and stamina. Dr. Day's assessment of clinical status (~45 min) utilizes the
      Stanford myotonic dystrophy questionnaire, the University of Rochester MDHI, and the muscular
      impairment rating scale (MIRS)57, and records vital signs, current medications, spirometer,
      and disease history and progression. Given the frequency of sleep disorders in DM, subjects
      will complete the Affiliated Sleep Questionnaire, an online collection of extensive
      information in standardized format (see letter Dr. Mignot). After the clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments the subject and family members will have lunch prior to the
      MRI(75 min). In the mid-afternoon subjects will have evoked potentials in the
      Electrodiagnostics Lab(~90 min) followed by a lumbar puncture (if consenting) and blood draw
      in the LPCH APU(90 min). Subjects return home the same day, and Ms. Paulose contacts them
      several days later for feedback.

    <description>The outcome of these studies will determine detailed spatial localization of white matter changes in DM1 children for the first time, and will establish a quantitative baseline with which future studies can determine the time course of the changes. The outcome results will determine whether functional abnormalities (fMRI, neuropsychological function, and evoked potentials) increase as white matter integrity deteriorates, and will explore tract-specific alteration of these effects. Defining cellular pathophysiology and CNS biomarkers of neurological dysfunction in DM will determine disease mechanisms and treatment pathways, and facilitate design of clinical and preclinical studies.</description>
