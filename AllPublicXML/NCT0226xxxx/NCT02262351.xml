  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for stroke. The identification and treatment
      of AF is one of the best way to prevent stroke. The problem is that because AF may cause
      minimal symptoms, it often goes undetected before a patient suffers a stroke. Also, it is
      known that as many as half of all patients with known AF may not be receiving appropriate
      anticoagulation for their condition. New technologies are making it possible to improve AF
      detection. Subjects in this study will be screened for AF using three simple methods: a
      30-second pulse check, a hand-held single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device and a blood
      pressure monitor with built-in AF screening capabilities. If more patients with AF can be
      detected, more patients will be able to receive guideline-recommended anticoagulant therapy,
      and more strokes, deaths, disability, and dementia will be prevented.

      Participants will be screened for AF using three simple methods (pulse check, single-lead
      ECG, blood pressure machine with automated AF detection algorithms). Subjects screening
      positive on any test will attend for a 12-lead ECG within 24 h. For all patients with AF
      detected, clinical characteristics and medications will be compared at baseline and 90±14
      days later.

    <description>The sensitivity and specificity of SL-ECG and BP-AF will be separately compared with that of pulse palpation alone using McNemar's method. This method can be used when only those subjects screening positive attend for confirmatory testing (12-lead ECG ± Holter monitor). A 2-sided alpha of 0.025 will be used to allow for multiple comparisons. A further analysis will be performed using the SL-ECG data as the gold standard. To ensure adequate diagnostic quality, this analysis will only be performed if 5% or less of the overall SL-ECG tracings are deemed &quot;uninterpretable&quot;. A bipolar ECG interpreted by a cardiologist has a reported 99% sensitivity and 96% specificity for the diagnosis of AF. If this exploratory analysis is performed it will enable estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the pulse-check and BP-AF device.</description>
