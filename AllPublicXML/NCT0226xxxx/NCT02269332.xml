      The investigators will recruit DoD beneficiaries 18 years or older, that have been referred
      for a screening colonoscopy or polyp surveillance (or had one in the last 2 weeks), and have
      no previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. They will have a 25 OH Vitamin D level drawn to
      determine if there is an association between the level obtained and findings on colonoscopy,
      or previous findings (if repeating).
