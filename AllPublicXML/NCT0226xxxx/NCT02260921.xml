        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  35 - 75 years of age

          -  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee. This
             includes radiographic evidence of osteophytes and at least one of the following: age ≥
             50 years old, morning stiffness ≤ 30 minute duration or crepitus on motion.

          -  Grade II or III osteoarthritis of the knee as determined by Kellgren-Lawrence
             classification grading scale on anteroposterior (AP) x-ray within previous 6 months.

          -  Subjects are ambulatory without assistive devices.

          -  Knee pain of ≥ 40 mm on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) when performing one of two movements
             that elicit the worst pain: standing from a seated position or walking up/down stairs.

          -  Subject reports knee pain in the anterior and/or inferior aspect of the knee as
             documented on the knee pain map in the appropriate areas.

          -  A diagnostic lidocaine (without epinephrine) block of the infrapatellar branch of the
             saphenous nerve results in a 50% reduction in the VAS pain assessment score when
             performing the activity that elicits the worst pain: standing from a seated position
             or walking up/down stairs.

          -  Subject is able to tolerate a washout of prescription and over-the-counter pain relief
             for a duration of 5X the half life of the medication prior to the Baseline visit.

        Subject is able to tolerate a washout of adjunctive therapies for knee pain for 72 hours
        prior to the Baseline visit.

          -  Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) NRS3.1 Pain subscore ≥ 20 at
             Baseline/Visit 2.

          -  Subject is able to tolerate discontinuation of all pain medication throughout the
             duration of the study. Acetaminophen may be used as rescue medication with a maximum
             dose of 4g per day.

          -  Subject is able to tolerate discontinuation of rescue medication, acetaminophen, for
             24 hours prior to all follow-up visits.

          -  Prescription and over-the-counter pain medications must be maintained on a stable
             schedule for at least two weeks prior to screening.

          -  Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all
             follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject is in good general health and free of any systemic disease state or physical
             condition that might impair evaluation or which in the Investigator's opinion, exposes
             the Subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a partial or full knee replacement of the knee to be treated.

          -  Planned partial or full knee replacement within the next 12 months in knee to be
             treated.

          -  Previous myoscience FCTTM treatment.

          -  Viscosupplementation within the previous 6 months in knee to be treated.

          -  Subject reports the majority of knee pain outside of the anterior/inferior aspect of
             the knee.

          -  Intra-articular steroid injection in the knee to be treated within previous 3 months.

          -  Gross deformity of the knee including varus or valgus.

          -  Started physical therapy of the knee to be treated within 3 months of screening.

          -  Received acupuncture for knee pain within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Body Mass Index ≥ 35.

          -  Prior surgery in the treatment area that may alter the anatomy of the infrapatellar
             branch of the saphenous nerve or result in scar tissue in the treatment area.

          -  Open and/or infected wound in the treatment area.

          -  Disease of the spine, hip, contralateral knee or other lower extremity joint of
             sufficient degree affecting the assessment of the treated knee.

          -  Acetaminophen intolerance or allergy.

          -  Allergy to lidocaine.

          -  History of cryoglobulinemia

          -  History of cold urticaria.

          -  History of Raynaud's disease.

          -  History of pes anserinus bursitis in the knee to be treated.

          -  Current enrollment in any investigational drug or device study or participation within

          -  Any additional diagnosis that in the opinion of the Investigator directly contributes
             to knee pain.

          -  Any concomitant inflammatory disease or other condition that affects the joints (e.g.
             rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic bone disease, gout, active infection, etc.)

          -  Any clotting disorder and/or use of an anticoagulant (e.g., aspirin, warfarin,
             clopidogrel, etc.) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.

          -  Any local skin condition at the treatment site that in the Investigator's opinion
             would adversely affect treatment or outcomes.

          -  Any chronic medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion would prevent
             adequate participation.

          -  Any chronic medication use (prescription, over-the-counter, etc.) that in the
             Investigator's opinion would affect study participation or Subject safety.

          -  For any reason, in the opinion of the Investigator, the Subject may not be a suitable
             candidate for study participation (i.e., history of noncompliance, drug dependency,
             any related knee injury due to a worker's compensation claim, etc.).

          -  Known liver dysfunction.
