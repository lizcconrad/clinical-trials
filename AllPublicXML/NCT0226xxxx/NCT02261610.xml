  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism vary greatly from the absence of specific
      clinical symptoms to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Clinical form of EP represented by
      &quot;lung superinfection&quot;, also called &quot;pulmonary embolism superinfected&quot; is common and
      represents up to 30% of initial clinical presentations; she been few evaluations in clinical
      research. The reality of the bacterial infection remains controversial and the clinical
      presentation often leads to the prescription of empirical antibiotic therapy, often
      unnecessary in many cases. Number of antibiotic prescriptions are probably inappropriate.

      Fever has long been recognized as a sign associated with pulmonary embolism. Stein et al
      reported a temperature above 37.5 ° C on 50% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism
      without actually clarified whether this was related to temperature with a pulmonary embolism
      or other associated cause. Murray et al estimated that greater than 38 ° C was explained by
      pulmonary embolism in 57.1% of patients while in the PIOPED study, only 14% of patients had
      fever with no other cause identified as pulmonary embolism. Fever due to pulmonary embolism
      is often low intensity (often less than 38.3) and of short duration, with a peak on the day
      of pulmonary embolism and a gradual decrease of about 1 week. The pathophysiology of fever in
      pulmonary embolism has not yet was completely clarified. It is suggested that a combination
      of several factors involved pyrogenic myocardial tissue necrosis and releasing
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, hemorrhage, vascular irritation or inflammation, atelectasis or
      local superinfection.

      Since 2004, the PCT has become a marker helping the initiation of antibiotic therapy in
      patients with community-acquired pneumonia. This is especially verified in patients admitted
      for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis. In the latter case, the use of PCT
      reduces inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Thus helping the clinician by measuring
      biomarkers such as PCT is based on writing an algorithm leading or not to use antibiotics.

      The use of an algorithm involving the PCT could just as for infectious pneumonia or COPD, of
      interest in the febrile pulmonary embolism to distinguish febrile forms related to bacterial
      infections febrile forms of EP to other causes.

      The investigators propose to realize a single-center prospective, randomized, parallel group,
      to compare two groups of patients admitted with febrile pulmonary embolism . In the first
      group of patients, the use of antibiotics will be guided by clinical (clinical group). In the
      second group, the use of antibiotics will be guided by the algorithm (PCT group). The guided
      by the PCT algorithm is only given aid the clinician in the therapeutic management without
      its application only requires the doctor in charge of the patient. So if your doctor may
      advocate (or deemed necessary) to continue (or start) antibiotics even if the PCT algorithm
      would allow him to stop (or not initiate).
