    <textblock>
      The goal is to evaluate the best way for paramedics and hospitals to work together to treat
      septic patients as quickly as possible.

      The investigators think that the best thing to do for septic patients is to identify and
      treat them as early as possible. This research will test this. The investigators think that
      if paramedics identify septic patients and begin treatment with fluids in the ambulance, then
      the patient will do better in the long run. The paramedic will also tell the hospital that a
      septic patient will be there soon. The caregivers can prepare and be ready to provide care as
      soon as the patient arrives. With this research, the investigators would like to see if these
      steps help patient outcomes.

    <description>Patients who are hypotensive or whose lactate is ≥ 2.5, prehospital providers will provide a notification to the receiving hospital (Hospital Notification), establish an IV, and provide 1 liter normal saline (NS) bolus of IV fluids. An additional 1 liter normal saline bolus will be given for systolic blood pressure less than 100. Patients who have a history of end-stage renal disease or congestive heart failure would receive only 20 milliliters/kilogram of fluid. If the patient remains hypotensive, Emergency Medical Services will continue providing fluids as is standard of care.</description>
