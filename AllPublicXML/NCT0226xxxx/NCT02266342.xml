  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a French Registry mandated by the French National Health Authority assessing
      long-term (5-years) safety of the GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis treating diseases of the
      thoracic aorta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular therapy to treat thoracic disease seems to provide a plausible benefit compared
      to surgery in terms of operative mortality and severe morbidity. The French National Health
      Authority (HAS) requires a 5-year follow-up as part of the renewal of reimbursement for these
      endoprostheses in order to collect long-term follow-up data under real-life conditions of
      use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient where a GORE® TAG® or Conformable GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis is
             implanted (successfully or not) for the treatment of disease of the descending
             thoracic aorta.

          -  Patient who had previously consented to the collection and processing of personal
             medical data.

          -  Patient older than 18 years at the time of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have already received treatment with a thoracic endoprosthesis other than
             the GORE® TAG® or Conformable GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis and for whom
             'revision' or reintervention is required.

          -  Patients whose clinical follow-up is not possible (i.e. patients who cannot return for
             control visits because they live abroad).
