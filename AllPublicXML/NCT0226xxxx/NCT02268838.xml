  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending dose, double-blind study.
      This study will be evaluating ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg of E6007. This
      study consists of 5 steps, 1 to 5. In steps 1 to 4 (at ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and
      400 mg), subjects will be randomly assigned in a 6:2 ratio (E6007: placebo) to receive single
      dose of the study drug under fasted condition. Following 3 days of washout period, subject
      will receive the study drug once daily for 7 days starting on the fifth day from the single
      dose administration.

      For step 3 (200 mg), subjects will subsequently have at least 17 days of washout period
      before being escalated to step 5 (200 mg) to receive single dose of E6007 under fed
      condition, to evaluate food effect of the study drug.
