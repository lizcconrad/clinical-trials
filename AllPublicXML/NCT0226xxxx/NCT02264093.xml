        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants in the study should be healthy males, range from 50 to 65 years of age and
        be within +- 20% of their normal weight (Broca-Index).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers will be excluded from the study if the result of the medical examination or
             laboratory tests (especially those which indicate liver malfunction) are judged by the
             clinical investigator to differ significantly from the normal clinical values

          -  Volunteers with blood pressure lower than 120/80 mm Hg or pulse rate below 60
             beats/min

          -  Volunteers whose blood pressure dropped below 100/60 mm Hg in the pre-test within 80
             mg propranolol

          -  Volunteers with Raw-values higher than their predicted normal upper limit

          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic , renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Volunteers with disease of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with
             psychiatric disorders

          -  Volunteers with known history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Volunteers with chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  Volunteers with history of allergy / hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which
             is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator

          -  Volunteers who have taken a drug with a long half life (&gt;=24 hours) within at least
             one month or less than ten half lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the
             study

          -  Volunteers who received any other drugs which might influence the results of the trial
             during the week prior the start of the study

          -  Volunteers who have participated in another study with an investigational drug within
             the last 2 month preceding this study

          -  Volunteers who are unable to refrain from smoking on the study days

          -  Volunteers who smoke more than 10 cigarettes (or 3 cigars or pipes) per day

          -  Volunteers who drink more than 40 g of alcohol per day

          -  Volunteers who are dependent on drugs

          -  Volunteers who have donated blood (&gt;=100ml) within the last 4 weeks

          -  Volunteers who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports)
             within the last week before the study
