    <textblock>
      This is single centre, single dose, open, randomised, cross-over, two-stage bioequivalence
      study to compare two different oral formulations of NAC.

      The study has been conducted in healthy volunteers of both genders, in one single dose of
      both formulations.

    <textblock>
      According to the two stage design, a first Group of healthy subjects has been dosed and
      analysis of plasma level of the drug will be performed. In the event the sample size is not
      sufficient for a powerful statistical analysis, an additional Group of subject will be dosed
      and data from these Group, will be pooled with the first Group to provide statistical
      results.
