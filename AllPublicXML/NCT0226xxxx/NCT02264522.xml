  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the photo-plethysmographic [PPG] waveform signal to guide
      the dialysis and ultrafiltration [UF] of chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients, and to
      further the investigators understanding of homeostasis in hemodialysis.

      The investigators hypothesize that the signals generated from the PPG device along with
      traditional monitoring and nursing judgment, will allow experienced, oriented staff to
      anticipate hemodynamic instability, intervene to prevent or mitigate the intradialytic
      hypotention [IDH], forestalling the onset of non-facilitating compensatory reflexes that
      preclude the patient from achieving an appropriate post-dialysis weight consistent with
      euvolemia. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the nephrologist and staff will be able to
      wean patients from anti-hypertensive medications and craft patient specific dialysis orders
      and UF profiles that achieve consistent, comfortable treatment to appropriate end points.

      The study aims include:

      Aim 1: To confirm the temporal sequence of PPG signals and changes in BP in routine
      hemodialysis.

      Aim 2: To refine further the predictive algorithms of PPG, augmented with continuous cardiac
      event monitoring (pre-intra-post hemodialysis) Aim 3: To develop targeted interventions to
      reverse the cardiovascular stress indicated by the PPG and to maintain perfusion.

      Aim 4: To develop care paths approved by the medical staff and primary care nephrologist
      allowing RNs to respond to signals from the PPG.
