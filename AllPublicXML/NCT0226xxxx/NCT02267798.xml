    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation restores functions and reduces disabilities due to diseases sequelae. The
      relationship between intensity of rehabilitation and clinical outcomes, recently emphasized,
      has generated a great interest for technological high-intensity interventions. However, their
      effects compared to traditional interventions as well the involved biological mechanisms
      remain uncertain. The present Strategic Program aims to predict the treatment efficacy in
      specific rehabilitation profiles, to improve the use of &quot;targeted&quot; therapies and the
      individual management of patients affected by stroke and to transfer these findings into
      rehabilitative strategies.

      Primary endpoint: Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) Secondary endpoints: Box and Block Test
      (BBT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS); motor cortex excitability (TMS); Electromyography
      analysis of muscle activation patterns during upper extremity movements; measurements of
      cerebral perfusion (NIRS); circulating biomarkers (see Figure 3 and Table 1). Overall
      assessments will be performed pre-, mid-, post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up.

    <description>Arm training protocol Training sessions will last for 60 minutes and will focus on repetitive tasks that incorporate multidirectional reaching actions. In this robot-assisted therapy a robot manipulator applies forces to the paretic arm during goal-directed movements.
Functional electrical stimulation protocol Experimental group will receive up to 40 minutes of FES after arm training. The device consists of a battery powered programmable stimulator and a forearm-wrist-hand orthosis containing 5 electrodes positioned to provide reliable activation of muscles. The intensity of stimulation will be set to a level that provided comfortable and consistent activation of the extensor and flexor muscles to achieve whole hand opening and functional grasping.</description>

    <description>Arm training protocol Training sessions will last for 60 minutes. The Reo Therapy System is robot-assisted therapy; during the session the subject's affected hand is placed on or strapped onto a robotic arm and the subject is instructed to either actively reach predefined reach points, or to be guided while the robotic arm leads the arm towards these reach points.
Functional electrical stimulation protocol Experimental group will receive up to 40 minutes of FES after arm training. The device consists is a stimulator containing 5 electrodes positioned to provide reliable activation of the following muscles: extensor digitatum communis and extensor pollices brevis, flexor pollices longus, flexor digitatum superficialis, and thenar muscles.</description>
