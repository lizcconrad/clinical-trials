  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to collect data for understanding whether messages
      in online environments impact fitness attitudes and behaviors. In particular, the study aims
      to experimentally examine what features of online social media - promotional messaging or
      peer networks - impact offline fitness measures (such fitness workshop enrollment and
      self-reported physical activity level). The study partners with an existing fitness program
      at a large northeastern university, which provides a 13-week fitness program for graduate and
      professional students at the university. The program begins with a university-run eligibility
      assessment of specific fitness measures for all participants, who win prizes for improvements
      in program participation and health behavior outcomes. The fitness program consists of
      semester-long series of workshops offered through the university's recreation department. The
      randomized trial constructs an online social media platform for the fitness program that
      provides a way to send either promotion health messages or messages about peer activities to
      the online community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary lifestyle among university students and young adults has become a global epidemic.
      Widespread use of social media is both a contributing factor, and a potential solution;
      however the cost-effective use of social media to promote fitness on college campuses is
      poorly understood. This study aims to identify what features of social media - promotional
      messaging or peer networks - can increase physical activity levels.

      In this randomized controlled trial, participants are randomized to three conditions: basic
      online program for enrolling in university-run weekly fitness workshops, media condition that
      supplements the basic program with promotional media messages, and a social condition that
      replaces the media content with a network of peers. Participants are limited to graduate and
      professional students at a large northeastern university.

    <description>Participants' enrollment in fitness workshops is recorded when participants digitally confirm their workshop registration. Workshop instructors confirm the attendance of enrolled participants. Enrollment is assessed up to 3 months from date of randomization.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the baseline and post-program (3 months) online surveys, participants answer the question: &quot;On how many of the past 7 days did you participate in physical activity for at least 30 minutes that did not make you sweat or breathe hard, such as fast walking, slow bicycling, and skating?&quot; Responses to the question range from 0 to 7.</description>

    <description>The control condition provides study participants with online tools for enrolling in offline fitness workshops offered by the university's recreation department and recording their progress in the program. All fitness workshops are pre-programmed in an online calendar. Upon clicking a workshop, participants can read a detailed description and register for it directly on the calendar. The registration then triggers a confirmation email sent to the participant immediately and a reminder email 12 hours before the workshop starts. In addition, an online tracking tool is built that participants can use to keep a daily journal of their health activities and fitness status.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The media condition evaluates the effects of informational and motivational messages on physical activity by supplementing the basic program tools with promotional media, including: &quot;high arousal&quot; videos encouraging physical activity, real-time email notifications about upcoming fitness workshops, and informational graphics with exercise tips and motivational messages. In the media condition, participants receive two videos on the website and one informational graphic that encourage physical activity on a weekly basis.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The social condition, by contrast, omits the media content. Instead, the basic program is supplemented with a network of four to six anonymous &quot;health peers,&quot; composed of other participants of the program. Within the program website, each participant is able to see their peers' basic profile information, as well as information about their peers' progress in the program, and real-time notifications about their peers' completion of program activities. These networks do not provide any added incentives or additional content to promote physical activity, nor can participants directly communicate with, or &quot;message&quot; their peers through the website.</description>
