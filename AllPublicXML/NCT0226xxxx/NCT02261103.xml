    <textblock>
      The objectives of the studies are:

        -  To demonstrate similar total exposure between pramipexole ER fasted and pramipexole ER
           fed after multiple administration of the highest daily dose of 4.5 mg q.d. and to reveal
           any food effect leading to uncontrolled release

        -  To investigate the relative bioavailability of the ER-formulation of pramipexole in
           comparison to the IR-formulation at the highest daily dose of 4.5 mg after multiple
           dosing

        -  To demonstrate dose proportionality between the dose strengths of the pramipexole ER
           formulation of 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg after multiple daily (q.d.) dosing
