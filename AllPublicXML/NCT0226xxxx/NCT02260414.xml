  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancer, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is particularly high in patients
      with myeloma, especially when it is de novo and treated with thalidomide, lenalidomide or
      erythropoietin. Curiously, the prevention of VTE with LMWH (low-molecular-weight heparin) in
      myeloma seems no more effective than that achieved with aspirin, while the effectiveness of
      the latter in the primary prevention of VTE has never been demonstrated regardless of the
      type of population considered. Meanwhile, a biological study showed that prophylactic doses
      of LMWH in patients with different types of cancer did not always optimal reduction of
      thrombin peak during the 24 hours following the injection of LMWH. These clinical and
      biological studies lead to the conclusion that patients with myeloma may be resistant to the
      usual doses of preventive LMWH, which may explain the failure of prevention.

      Initially we intend to investigate whether this resistance to prophylactic doses of LMWH is
      present in patient's biology and if this resistance is specific to myeloma in hematological
      cancers. For this, we propose to study the evolution of thrombin generation by
      Thrombinography during 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of 4500 anti-Xa IU Tinzaparin in
      6 patients with de novo myeloma whit high thrombo embolic risk ie treated with thalidomide,
      lenalidomide or erythropoietin. LMWH is Tinzaparin chosen because it does not accumulate in
      patients with impaired renal function, and has a greater anti-biological activity thrombotic
      than other LMWH.

      To assess whether the observed pattern of thrombin generation is particularly multiple
      myeloma, we will take the same study in 6 patients with aggressive lymphoma and 6 medical
      patients hospitalized for acute heart and respiratory failure.
