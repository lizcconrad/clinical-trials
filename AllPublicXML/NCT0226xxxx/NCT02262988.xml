    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefit of enhancing total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) surgery using some of your own cells taken from fat tissue that may be
      able to help recovery and repair of knee tissues.

      Your participation in this study will require that you allow the surgical team to use a fat
      pad in your knee that is usually discarded during surgery to harvest regenerative cells. The
      fat pad will be processed using the Transpose RTTM system (InGeneron, Inc., Houston, TX, USA)
      to produce adipose-derived regenerative cells. These cells will be re-injected in your knee
      during the surgery. These cells may encourage healing at the surgical site, although whether
      or how much they encourage healing is unknown. Determining whether such improved healing
      occurs is the purpose of this study.

      All patients will have the infrapatellar fat pad removed as part of the normal total knee
      arthroplasty surgery. Some patients will have the fat pad processed and cells inserted back
      in their knee. Other patients will have saline inserted into the knee in the same manner as
      the fat pad cells. To which group of patients/participants you would be assigned is
      determined by a random process, similar to flipping a coin. The surgery is the same in all
      other ways for all patients.

      Your participation will require that you attend your regularly scheduled postoperative
      visits. You will not have to make any extra clinic visits for this study. After you leave the
      hospital, you will be asked to rate your pain daily until you return for your first
      postoperative visit at 7-10 days. At your postoperative visits at 7-10 days, 1 month and 3
      months, you will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire and your knee swelling, range of
      motion and function will be evaluated by Dr. Burke. Your participation in this study would
      also allow the investigator (Dr. Burke) to use certain information from your medical records,
      although your name or identity will not be revealed publicly in any resulting report or
      summary of the study.
