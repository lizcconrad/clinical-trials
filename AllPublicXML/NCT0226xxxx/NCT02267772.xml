    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if IV acetaminophen can 1) decrease pain in pregnancy women, 2)reduce
      the amount of opioid use in pregnant women who encounter pain, 3) reduce maternal and fetal
      adverse effects compared to opioids.

      Design: This is a comparative effective trial that is a randomized, controlled trial of IV
      acetaminophen vs. IV morphine in pregnant women.

      Procedures: Women meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to IV acetaminophen
      or IV morphine. The IV acetaminophen group will get up to four standard doses of IV
      acetaminophen during their stay at the hospital. The second group will get up to six standard
      doses of morphine. Subjects will complete a pain scale after medication administration and
      will be asked about any side effects.

      Rationale for this clinical trial The goal of analgesia in pregnancy is to reduce pain while
      minimizing both maternal and fetal adverse effects. Current opioids used in pregnancy provide
      minimal pain relief and are associated with adverse effects. IV acetaminophen has been shown
      to significantly improve pain control following cesarean section and in the first stage of
      labor. Moreover, IV acetaminophen reduces the need and consumption of opioids following
      surgery. If IV acetaminophen can be as effective in controlling pain associated with maternal
      medical conditions and uterine contractions with labor, then the use of parenteral opiods in
      pregnant women and its exposure to the fetus could be reduced. This could provide new
      opportunities in the medical management of pain in pregnancy. Thus we propose a comparative
      effectiveness trial of IV acetaminophen compared to IV morphine.

      Hypothesis:

      We hypothesize that IV acetaminophen is as effective as IV morphine in reducing pain in
      pregnant women. In doing so, IV acetaminophen can reduce the amount of narcotics needed in
      women with pain.

      Objectives:

      To determine if IV acetaminophen can:

        1. Decrease pain in pregnant women

        2. Reduce the amount of opioid use in pregnant women who encounter pain

        3. Reduce maternal and fetal adverse effects compared to opioids

      Study Design:

      For this comparative effective trial, we propose a randomized, controlled trial of IV
      acetaminophen vs. IV morphine in pregnant women. Prior studies have confirmed that IV
      acetaminophen is effective in controlling pain compared to placebo.[14,20] Thus,
      administering just a placebo for pain control is not justified at this time.

      We will include 3 different groups of pregnant populations who encounter pain for different
      reasons.

      Group 1: Pregnant women with uterine contractions, but not in labor Group 2: Pregnant women
      with uterine contractions in the first stage of labor Group 3: Pregnant women with a medical
      condition associated with pain.

    <description>The primary outcome variable will be the summed difference in pain intensity in those women in Group 2 in the first stage of labor. Pain intensity will be based on a 100 mm visual analog scale. The subject will be asked to mark with a pen on the scale to rate their pain. If they are unable to mark the scale with a pen, this will be noted.
The pain intensity via the VAS will determined at 6 time points:
prior to administration of the medication
15 minutes after administration
1 hours after administration
2 hours after administration
6 hours after administration. This will be obtained within 30 minutes after the second dose is given.
24 hours after administration if the patient is still hospitalized. This will be obtained within 30 minutes after 24 hour dose is given.
The summed difference in pain intensity will be defined as the difference in pain scale from each point 2-6 minus point 1.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

        Group 1. We will include pregnant women greater than 24 weeks of pregnancy who present with
        uterine contractions, but are not in labor and who are warranting treatment with
        intravenous medication for pain control as part of their routine treatment. This will be
        defined as the presence of uterine contractions documented on the tocodynanometer. However,
        the cervix remains less than 2 cm dilated and has not changed after 1 hour after
        re-examining her cervix.[23]

        Group 2. We will include pregnant women greater than 34 weeks of pregnancy who present with
        uterine contractions and are in the first stage of labor and who are warranting treatment
        with intravenous medication for pain control as part of their routine treatment. This will
        be defined as the presence of uterine contractions documented on the tocodynanometer and
        cervical dilation greater than 2 cm, but less than 6 cm. [23]

        Group 3. We will include pregnant women greater than 16 weeks of pregnancy who present with
        pain due to a maternal medical condition including sickle cell crisis, pyelonephritis,
        pancreatitis, cholecystitis, nephrolithiasis or headache and who are warranting treatment
        with intravenous medication for pain control as part of their routine treatment.

        Exclusion criteria:

        We will exclude women less than 18 years of age, less than 16 weeks gestation, with weight
        less than 50 kg, and contraindications to acetaminophen including reported elevated liver
        function tests, hepatic injury, hepatic disorder, active liver disease, alcoholism, chronic
        malnutrition, known coagulapathy, hemorrhage, creatinine &gt; 1.0, or known allergy or
        hypersensitivity to acetaminophen. We will also exclude women who have received any opioids
