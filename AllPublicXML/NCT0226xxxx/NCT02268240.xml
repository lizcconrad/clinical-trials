    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot randomized trial of a stepped collaborative care intervention
      designed to decrease post-concussive symptoms and improve post-injury functioning among
      sports-injured youth aged 11-17. Participants with persistent post-concussive symptoms
      (symptoms persisting at least two months post-injury) will be recruited from Seattle
      Children's Hospital departments of sports medicine and rehabilitation medicine. Consent and
      assent will be obtained in-person. Participants will be randomized to receive either the
      stepped collaborative care intervention, or treatment-as-usual. Participants will be assessed
      on a range of symptoms and areas of functioning at four time points: 0 months, 1 month, 3
      months, and 6 months after enrollment. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention group
      athletes, when compared to usual care control group athletes, will demonstrate clinically and
      statistically significant reductions in postconcussive, anxiety, and depressive symptoms over
      the course of the 6-month study. Secondary analyses will assess the impact of the
      intervention on functional impairment including missed school days and other academic
      outcomes. Exploratory analyses will examine MRI findings that are characteristic of
      postconcussive neuropathology, if available in medical record, as predictors of treatment
      responses.

    <description>Intervention will include : 1) care management; 2) cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); 3) psychiatric medication consultation in addition too receiving standard care through their medical team. Care management will include initial consultation to determine participants' and families' concerns and areas of difficulty, followed by brief interventions to connect them with care providers as needed . If participants do not show adequate symptom reduction, they will be engaged in structured CBT. CBT will be delivered in 4 to 12 structured sessions, each ranging from 30-60 minutes in length. Psychiatric medication consultation will be offered on an as-needed basis for participants not adequately responding to prior stepped care interventions. MD providers with expertise in psychopharmacological treatment of youth will provide consultation for participants' primary care provider regarding the prescription of psychiatric medications.</description>
