  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the prognosis of recurrent high-grade gliomas is still dismal with no standard
      treatment protocol established. Cisplatin (CDDP), recommended by National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN) as a chemotherapeutic agent in salvage treatment for recurrent
      high-grade gliomas, was shown to reduce O6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyl transferase (AGAT) activity
      and potentially capable of enhancing the antitumor effects of temozolomide (TMZ). Compared to
      the standard 5-day TMZ regimen, alternating weekly regimen that deliver more prolonged
      exposure of TMZ may lead to higher cumulative doses, and may deplete more O6-methylguanine
      DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), thus reducing the resistance of tumor cells to TMZ.

      The investigators therefore initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of CDDP plus alternating weekly TMZ regimen in patients with recurrent
      high-grade gliomas.

    <description>Patients were treated with CDDP and TMZ. CDDP was administered iv from Day 1 to 3 with everyday dose of 30mg. TMZ was orally administered from Day 1 to 7 and Day 15 to 21, with everyday dose of 125mg/m2 (Level 2). The period of one chemotherapy cycle is 28 days. TMZ dose levels were listed in Table 1.

    <description>If hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0) from the previous cycle had been grade 0 or 1, then TMZ dose escalation to was allowed to the maximum of 150 mg/m2. If grade 4 hematologic toxicity or grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity had occurred, then TMZ dose was reduced in 25 mg/m2 steps. If grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred, patient treatment was halted. If grade 4 hematologic toxicity or grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity continued when TMZ dose was in the minimum of 75 mg/m2, patient treatment was halted.</description>
