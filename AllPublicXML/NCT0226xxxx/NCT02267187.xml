  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of the fat grafting procedure on facial appearance and
      quality of life over time by precisely measuring soft tissue volume with CT scans, assessing
      appearance with 2D and 3D photography and standard photography and evaluating quality of life
      through various validated psychosocial measures. This study will be a very important
      evaluation of the effectiveness of this therapy, and will help guide clinicians in applying
      this technique. Additionally, laboratory testing of the injected fat material will be
      performed so that the results may be correlated with clinical outcomes in the future.

      The study endpoints include the analysis of the graft site via study procedures at different
      time points, the comparison of cotton rolling to centrifugation method of autologous fat
      grafting, as well as the correlation of cell behavior of the laboratory assays with clinical
      outcomes.

      Clinical use of autologous fat grafting in humans was described as early as 1893, when Neuber
      published his report of transferring multiple small particles of fat to fill a soft tissue
      depression. Over the past three decades, autologous fat grafting has become a common
      procedure in clinical plastic surgery, and is also employed by clinicians in other
      specialties. The refinement of liposuction techniques in the 1980's made it possible to
      harvest the adipose grafts with low risk and without the need for a significant incision. The
      liposuction aspirate could simply be reinjected at a different site. Specialized equipment
      has been developed for fat grafting and is commercially available from a number of sources.
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons 2007 procedural statistics show that over 65,000 fat
      grafting procedures were performed in the United States (www.plasticsurgery.org) during the
      previous year.

      Fat grafting may represent a superior method of facial reconstruction after severe trauma,
      but the results can be impacted by resorption of fat volume over time. The specific aims of
      the study are:

        1. Assess facial appearance and soft tissue volume before and after autologous fat grafting
           using CT scans and 3D photography.

        2. Assess cellular properties of the cells within the fat graft

        3. Comparison of cotton rolling to centrifugation method of autologous fat grafting

        4. Measure of quality of life in patients before and after autologous fat grafting using
           validated psychosocial measures.

      Ten (10) subjects 18 years of age and older will be enrolled to this trial.

    <description>Fat Grafting is a procedure that involves moving a person's own fat from an area of the body where it is less needed to another area of the body to improve its appearance. The fat is usually taken from the thighs or abdomen with a small liposuction tube and then moved to an area that has lost volume or fullness due to aging, trauma, surgery, birth defects, or other causes.</description>

    <description>The plastic surgeon, will use small narrow tube-like instruments called cannulas, will remove fat from various places throughout the body (commonly the abdomen and thighs). The plastic surgeon will then use the Coleman cannulas (specialized smaller cannulas with varied shapes and tip sizes specifically made to deliver smaller amounts of fat) to fill the desired area.</description>

          -  Craniofacial defects intended for treatment have open wounds or communicate with oral
             cavity or sinus (note: presence of such a defect in the setting of another defect(s)
             that meets treatment criteria will not exclude the patient from participating)

          -  Active infection anywhere in the body

             manifest either: 1) evidence of currently active alcohol or psychoactive drug abuse or
             dependence on the SCID interview, or 2) a GAF score of 40 or lower due to any acute
             psychiatric symptomatology (e.g. suicidality, psychosis, severe depression or mania)
             will be reviewed by the Co-I for Psychosocial Assessment with the PI for determination
             of possible medical instability. Final determination of medically unstable status will
             be made by the PI on the basis of overall medical status and appropriateness for

            <description>For the purpose of this study the fat grafting procedure is a research procedure. It is very important to note that this research procedure is not an experimental procedure. Fat grafting is a minimally invasive clinical procedure that has been widely used by plastic surgeons within reconstructive surgery for many years. Fat grafting is known as a filler providing an accurate means to restoring facial soft tissue structure.
The processing of the fat graft material is done using a cotton rolling technique via a Tefla non-adherent gauze pad in a rolling technique that separates the aqueous and oil layers from the injected component.</description>
