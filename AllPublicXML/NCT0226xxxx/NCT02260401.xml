  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal stenosis is one of the most common causes of low back pain among older adults and can
      result in significant disability. Despite this, it still isn't known which treatments are
      most effective or what outcomes are most important to these older adults. Through a Patient
      Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) contract, the investigators are building on the
      existing infrastructure of an AHRQ-funded (ARRA CHOICE award) comparative effectiveness
      research (CER) trial of epidural steroid injections (ESI) for spinal stenosis (the LESS
      trial) to address several critical research questions. The proposed study will answer the
      following key questions. Do decision aids tailored to older adults with spinal stenosis
      change patient decision-making regarding subsequent treatments? Do patients respond
      differently at subsequent outcome assessments time-points after receiving tailored decision
      aids that contain their own individual outcome data from prior treatments? The investigators
      hypothesize that providing these individualized reports will allow patients to make more
      informed choices regarding subsequent treatments, leading to reduced use of ineffective
      treatments and improved outcomes overall.

      LESS trial participants will be randomized to receive the individualized outcome report
      before the 18-month interview or after the 24-month follow up. Both groups will be asked to
      rank outcome domains of most importance to them, to answer questions regarding their beliefs
      about receiving future treatments for spinal stenosis and to complete the standard
      self-reported outcomes questionnaire. In addition, we will ask the study participants whether
      the information presented in the individualized report was helpful in deciding their future
      epidural injection treatments as well as if the content of the reports was easy to
      understand. At 24 months, we will repeat the interview and the outcomes assessment. We will
      again compare the groups in terms of their responses to determine if there are lasting
      differences in how patients who received the individualized reports make decisions regarding
      future treatments and respond to the self-reported outcomes questions. In addition, we will
      compare healthcare utilization between the two groups from 18 months to 24 months to
      determine if providing the individualized outcomes reports changed treatment utilization
      (i.e., do people who receive the report undergo fewer subsequent injections or other
      treatments for pain?). We hypothesize that providing these individualized reports will allow
      patients to make more informed choices regarding subsequent treatments, leading to reduced
      use of ineffective treatments and improved outcomes overall.
