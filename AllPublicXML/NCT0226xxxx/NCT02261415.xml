      This is a multicentre Vanguard randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of
      tranexamic acid (TXA) on perioperative blood transfusion in patients undergoing liver
      resection. The rationale for this study includes: (1) experimental evidence supporting the
      use of TXA in other surgical populations; (2) lack of evidence in patients undergoing liver
      resection; (3) clinical uncertainty and extensive support amongst hepatobiliary surgeons,
      anaesthesiologists, and hematologists for this proposed trial; (4) a feasible and efficient
      study design; and (5) the importance of the question: incidence of blood transfusion in
      patients undergoing liver resection is high, and the consequences serious. Different regions
      of Canada are well represented in the selection of study sites and five major sites have
      committed to participate in the Vanguard trial, including: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
      (Toronto), University Health Network (Toronto), Foothills Medical Centre (Calgary), McGill
      University Health Centre (Montreal), and Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre (Halifax).
      We will enroll 400 patients in this Vanguard study. This Vanguard study will assist us in
      determining the feasibility and planning of a definitive multicentre RCT across Canada. If
      the Vanguard study confirms feasibility, we will expand the trial to additional sites and
      proceed directly into the definitive trial (planned sample size = 1230 patients). The
      following is a brief schema and study outline of the trial.

      Purpose Results of this study will provide essential feasibility data for planning and
      conducting a large national trial that will definitively establish the impact of TXA on blood
      transfusion in patients undergoing liver resection. There are special challenges related to
      patient recruitment, adherence to detailed transfusion protocols, and data collection, all of
      which the TXA Vanguard trial will help to address. Success of the TXA Vanguard trial will be
      based on the ability to achieve each of the seven feasibility objectives: (1) Proportion of
      patients screened who meet the eligibility criteria for the definitive trial; (2) Proportion
      of eligible patients who consent to participate in this trial; (3) Adherence to randomized
      intervention; (4) Missing data including operative details, blood loss, blood transfusions,
      and complications; (5) Assess adherence with perioperative blood transfusion guidelines; (6)
      Assess transfusion incidence; (7) Estimate the resource requirements for each participating
      site to conduct the full RCT.

      Hypothesis Results of this study will provide essential feasibility data for planning and
      conducting a large national trial that will definitively establish the impact of TXA on blood
      transfusion in patients undergoing liver resection.

      Justification Were the investigators to demonstrate that TXA use in liver resection resulted
      in an important decrease in blood transfusions, clinical practice worldwide would be likely
      to change. Over 2000 patients in Canada undergo liver resection annually and could benefit
      from this simple, low-cost intervention. This intervention could easily be implemented in
      other countries, where many more patients undergo liver resection annually. Furthermore, TXA
      may be beneficial in other operative fields where bleeding is a major problem, including
      thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery, and many others. There are practical challenges related
      to patient recruitment, adherence to detailed transfusion protocols and data collection, all
      of which the TXA pilot Vanguard will address.

      Objectives

      Before embarking on a national definitive RCT to address the objectives listed in the Purpose
      above, this Vanguard trial has seven specific feasibility objectives:

        1. To determine the proportion of patients screened at five major hepatopancreaticobiliary
           centres that meet the eligibility criteria for a definitive trial.

        2. To calculate the proportion of eligible patients who consent to participate in this
           trial.

        3. To assess the ability to randomize patients and adherence with the group allocation.

        4. To examine the ability to collect complete perioperative data on participants, including
           operative details, blood loss, blood transfusions, and complications.

        5. To assess adherence with perioperative blood transfusion guidelines.

        6. Assess transfusion incidence.

        7. To estimate the resource requirements for each participating site to conduct the full
           RCT.

      The Primary Outcome is the length of time required to enroll 200 patients into this Vanguard
      trial.

      Research Method This is a multicentre Vanguard randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate
      the impact of tranexamic acid (TXA) on perioperative blood transfusion in patients undergoing
      liver resection. The trial will conceal allocation, maximize possible blinding, independently
      assess the appropriateness of transfusion, use strategies to limit loss to follow-up and
      crossovers, and use a conservative stopping rule. Patients will be administered a single dose
      of study drug intravenously immediately after induction of anaesthesia, followed by infusion
      over eight hours.

      Statistical Analysis The results of this Vanguard trial will be used to assess the
      feasibility and inform design issues of the full RCT. We will present point estimates of
      feasibility events, including adherence to protocol and accrual, as proportions with 95% CI.
      We will present continuous data as means and standard deviations, or medians and
      inter-quartile ranges, as appropriate.
