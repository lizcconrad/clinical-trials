    <description>Eligible patients will receive placebo doses once weekly at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by a dose after four weeks at Week 8. Prior to taking the Week 12 dose, the patient will be assessed for response to treatment using the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI). If the subject is a responder, the subject will continue on placebo dosing weekly at Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and then after four weeks at Week 20. Subjects who are not responders will be switched to treatment with secukinumab 300 mg and will dose once weekly at Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and then after four weeks at Week 20.</description>

    <description>Secukinumab 300 mg will be provided in 1 mL prefilled syringes of 150 mg. Each dose of 300 mg secukinumab will consist of two secukinumab 150 mg injections once weekly for 5 weeks (Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by dosing every four weeks starting at Week 8 through Week 20 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, patients will receive additional placebo injections at Weeks 13, 14 and 15. The patients (or caregivers) will self-inject each dose at the study site under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur of days of study visits. The injections not occurring during a study visit will be done by the patients (or caregivers) at home.</description>

PSSI non-responders will be switched to receive 300 mg secukinumab at Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, then after four weeks at Week 20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic scalp psoriasis for at least the previous six months

          -  Moderate to severe scalp psoriasis as defined by a PSSI score of ≥12 and 30% or higher
             of scalp surface area affected

          -  Must be candidates for systemic therapy, which means having scalp psoriasis
             inadequately controlled by topical treatments (corticosteroids), and/or phototherapy,
             and/or previous systemic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque

          -  Drug-induced psoriasis (e.g., new onset or current exacerbation from β-blockers,
             calcium channel inhibitors)

          -  Ongoing use of prohibited treatments (e.g., topical or systemic corticosteroids, UV
             therapy)

          -  Prior exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly targeting
             IL17A or IL-17RA receptors

          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to study entry, or within a
             period of 5 half-lives of the investigational treatment, whichever is longer

          -  Active, ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the
             evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab

          -  Active system infections (with the exception of the common cold) during the two weeks
             prior to starting study treatment

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
