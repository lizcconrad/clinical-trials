    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With ≥2-Grade Improvement From Baseline on Both the Investigator's and Subject's Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) Ratings of Forehead Line Severity at Maximum Eyebrow Elevation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator and subject each assessed the severity of the subject's forehead lines at maximum eyebrow elevation using the 4-grade FWS, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. The percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline assessed by both the Investigator and the subject are reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With an Investigator Rating of None or Mild on the 4-Grade FWS for Forehead Line Severity at Maximum Eyebrow Elevation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of the subject's forehead lines at maximum eyebrow elevation using the 4-grade FWS, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. The percentage of subjects with a score of &quot;none&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; are reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With ≥1-Grade Improvement From Baseline on the Investigator's FWS Rating of Forehead Line Severity at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of the subject's forehead lines at rest using the 4-grade FWS, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. The percentage of subjects with at least a 1-grade improvement assessed by the Investigator are reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Reporting Mostly Satisfied or Very Satisfied on the 5-Point Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire (FLSQ) Item 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The FLSQ consists of 13 questions that assess subject satisfaction and appearance-related impacts associated with facial lines. Item 5 on the FLSQ asks &quot;How satisfied are you with the effect your treatment had on your facial lines?&quot; Responses included: very satisfied, mostly satisfied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, mostly dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied. The percentage of subjects reporting a score of mostly satisfied or very satisfied with treatment are reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With ≥20-Point Improvement From Baseline on the Impact Domain of the FLSQ Among Subjects With Baseline Score ≥ 20 Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The FLSQ consists of 13 questions that assess subject satisfaction and appearance-related impacts associated with facial lines. The Impact Domain measures the subject's appearance-related and emotional impacts of treatment and is composed of 5 questions with a possible range of scores from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), using a transformed scale. Only subjects with baseline scores ≥ 20 are included in the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With a ≥3-Point Improvement From Baseline on Item 4 of the 11-Point Facial Line Outcomes (FLO-11) Questionnaire©</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The FLO-11 assess the subject's psychological and appearance-related impacts associated with facial lines. Item 4 is &quot;I look older than my actual age because of my facial lines&quot; with a range of possible scores from 0 = not at all to 10 = very much. Only subjects with baseline scores ≥ 3 are included in the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Retreatment Eligibility</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to retreatment eligibility is defined as the number of days from treatment cycle 1 injection to the return to an Investigator FWS rating of moderate or severe at maximum eyebrow elevation. The FWS is a 4-grade scale, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. Only subjects who achieved a ≥ 2-grade improvement on both the Investigator and subject FWS ratings at maximum eyebrow elevation on Day 30 are included in the analysis.</description>
