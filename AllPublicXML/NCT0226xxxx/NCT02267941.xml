      To evaluate epidemiological features of risk factors for aortic dissection (AD) in Chinese
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease with high mortality.
      Without optimal treatment, approximately 50% of patients die within one week of the onset of
      symptoms, and 80% die within 2 weeks. With the change of life-style and the development of
      diagnostic technology, the incidence and detection rate of AD were increasing in China
      recently. However, the cause remains unclear. Studies showed that AD were associated with
      some risk factors, such as hypertension, connective tissue disease, iatrogenic injury, drug,
      pregnancy, etc. It is reported that two thirds patients with AD had a history of
      hypertension; 50% patients aged &lt;40 years were accompanied with hereditary Marfan syndrome;
      13ï½ž19% had a familial history of aortic aneurysm or dissection. These epidemiological data
      were obtained from Caucasian population, however, such information was not available for the
      Chinese population. Moreover, epidemiological investigation was absent in China, and the
      assessment of risk factors for AD was mainly referred to the studies from developed
      countries. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate epidemiological features of risk
      factors for AD in Chinese patients using 3045 individuals from the 15 major centers in China.
      We anticipated that this analysis would provide helpful information preventing and
      controlling AD in China.

    <description>Diagnosis of aortic dissection was based on history and physical examination, and confirmed by imaging, visualization at surgery, and/or postmortem examination. According to the Stanford classification system, type A aortic dissection was defined as any dissection that involves the ascending aorta and type B as any that does not. Acute stage was confined to initial 14 days after symptom onset. Simple aortic aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm were excluded. Surgical and endovascular treatments were the main interventions and performed in the case group.</description>

    <description>As the control group, 2760 patients without AD were obtained from the hospitalized patients in the same period. Types of disease in the control group included congenital heart disease (632), coronary heart disease (467), adult valve disease (375), pulmonary artery hypertension (292), appendicitis (234), pneumonia (197), fracture (189), intestinal polyps (167), gallstone (156), esophagus cancer (51). Patients in the control group were derived from Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of General Surgery, Department of Thoracic Surgery, and Department of Respiration, respectively.</description>

        Between January, 2011 and December, 2012, we collected 3045 patients with AAD (1668 with
        type A and 1377 with type B) from 15 major centers in China as the case group. As the
        control group, 2760 patients without AD were obtained from the hospitalized patients in the
        same period.
