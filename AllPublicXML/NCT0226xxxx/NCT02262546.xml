  <brief_title>Influence of Pramipexole on the QT Interval of the ECG in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo Controlled Study With Two Sequential Two-way Cross-over Parts to Demonstrate That the Influence of Pramipexole up to 4.5 mg Daily on the QT Interval of the ECG in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers is Comparable With Placebo, With a Positive Control (Two-way Cross-over Moxifloxacin Versus Placebo)</official_title>
