    <textblock>
      A single center prospective, randomized, controlled split face study comparing a 532nm KTP
      laser with a 595nm PDL for the treatment of Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea and
      Papulopustular Rosacea.

      Subjects will receive up to 3 laser treatments 4 weeks apart and will be followed at 4 to 6
      weeks post-final laser treatment.
