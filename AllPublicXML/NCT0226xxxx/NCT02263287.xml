  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia in autopsy
      series. However, DLB represents a small proportion of the clinical diagnoses in epidemiology
      registries. Indeed Alzheimer disease (AD) and DLB are often concomitant, they share many
      symptoms and only a small weight is given to non-motor symptoms in DLB diagnosis. DLB is at
      the end of a pathological spectrum overlapping with AD, explaining the poor diagnostic value
      of both diagnostic criteria. To date there is still a need for a tool able to discriminate
      patients with pure DLB from those expressing common signs with both AD and DLB and those with
      pure AD. The purpose of this study is to validate a semi quantitative scale designed to
      reflect the Lewy Bodies burden in patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline. The
      investigators hypothesized that the score obtained may differentiate between AD, DLB and
      patients fulfilling clinical criteria for both DLB an AD. This score could also be correlated
      with dopaminergic depletion assessed with [18F]fluorodopa PET/computed tomography and/or with
      potential biomarkers of ADD measured in cerebrospinal fluid. This clinical validation is a
      preliminary work preceding further studies correlating the LeSCoD score with functional
      imaging features, prognosis and therapeutic response. Thus, the expected outcomes involve an
      improvement in demented patients' care, as well as a better patient selection for further
      therapeutic studies
