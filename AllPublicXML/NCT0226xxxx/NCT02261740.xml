  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The POPPY Study is a pilot of an Iyengar-based, therapeutic yoga program, used to treat
      pelvic or genital pain, in up to 16 women. Women aged 21 years and older who report
      persistent or recurrent pelvic or genital pain for at least 6 months that interferes with
      sexual activity will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area. Those who meet eligibility
      criteria will take part in a 6-week yoga therapy program designed by an expert yoga panel.
      Women will attend twice-weekly group classes focusing on Iyengar-based yoga techniques that
      have been carefully selected for their potential to improve women's genito-pelvic pain and
      practice yoga at home one additional hour a week.

      The investigators will evaluate changes in the severity and impact of women's pain using
      validated questionnaires and diaries.

Classes will be led by an experienced instructor. Women will also be taught to avoid any habits that may worsen their genito-pelvic pain (e.g., straining their pelvic floor muscles).
Participants will also be asked to practice yoga at home an additional hour per week throughout the 6-week yoga therapy program. Participants will be given a detailed written manual to use for home practice.</description>

          3. Report an eligible average daily pain intensity score after completion of a Daily Pain
             Log for one week prior to baseline

          4. Have an established primary care or gynecologic healthcare provider (to facilitate
             medical follow-up of any health issues detected incidentally in the study or adverse
             events that develop during the study)

          5. Report prior clinical evaluation of their pelvic or genital pain by a health care
             professional including at least a superficial pelvic exam

          6. Willing to refrain from initiating other new clinical treatments that may affect their

             postmenopausal) during the study

          3. Diagnosed with an alternate cause of pain that is unlikely to respond to yoga and

             dermatosis

          4. Surgery to the vulva, vagina, cervix, or pelvic organs within 6 months of screening,
             or any prior history of cancer or irradiation to these structures

          5. Initiation of or dose escalation of pharmacologic agents that may affect pelvic or
             genital pain in the past 1 month (e.g., antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
             anxiolytics)â€”women on stable dose for &gt;1 month are eligible

          6. Use of formal psychological therapies specifically for pelvic or genital pain (e.g.,
             systematic desensitization, sex therapy, cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy) within
             1 month of screening

          7. Use of formal behavioral therapies for pelvic or genital pain (e.g., pelvic floor

             position without assistance in &lt;10 seconds

          9. Currently involved in a malpractice suit or other litigation specifically related to
             pelvic or genital pain

         10. Participation in another interventional study that might interfere with or confound
             study procedures, inability to sign an informed consent or fill out questionnaires, or
             conflict with available yoga class dates
