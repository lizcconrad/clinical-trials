    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-part, first-in-human study of oral branaplam in infants with Type 1
      spinal muscular atrophy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy after 13 weeks; and to estimate the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of orally administered branaplam; and to identify the dose that
      is safe for long term use as well as that can provide durable efficacy optimal dosing regimen
      in patients with Type 1 SMA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-part, first-in-human, proof of concept study in infants with
      Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy who have exactly 2 copies of SMN2, to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of oral branaplam after 13 weeks treatment.

      Parts 1 and 2 are intended to be non-confirmatory. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be
      dosed once weekly with branaplam. The branaplam dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts
      until MTD is determined or when sufficient PK results confirm that the MTD cannot be reached
      due to a potential pharmacokinetic plateau at higher doses. A decision to dose escalate the
      next cohort will be made after safety data have been collected for 14 days following the
      first dose (14-day DLT window). PK will be used to confirm that there is no accumulation of
      the compound.

      Part 2 of the study will enroll new patients into one of up to 3 dose cohorts with once
      weekly dosing for 52 weeks. The branaplam dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts after
      6 patients have been enrolled and at least 3 patients from the previous cohort will have
      completed 13 weeks of treatment. After 52 weeks, patients may continue treatment if Novartis,
      the investigator and the independent DMC agree that this is in the best interest of the
      patient.

      In all cases continuation of the treatment will be done at a dose selected as optimum,
      considering existing safety as well as efficacy data
