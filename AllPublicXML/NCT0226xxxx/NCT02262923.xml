  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metoclopramide is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic and gastrokinetic
      properties which has been approved for use in pregnant women. Women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) have been found to have lower dopaminergic tone and increased ovarian
      vascularity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to controls. During
      ovarian stimulation, PCOS patients exhibit greater sensitivity to gonadotropins and increased
      follicular development. Administration of dopamine D2 antagonists may mimic the low
      dopaminergic tone noted in PCOS patients, increase VEGF levels, angiogenesis, and
      subsequently improve follicular growth during ovarian stimulation. This strategy could be
      used to improve IVF outcomes in poor responders.

      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to gonadotropin use alone, the use of
      metoclopramide in combination with gonadotropins in poor responders undergoing IVF will
      result in an increased number of mature oocytes obtained at oocyte retrieval and improved IVF
      outcomes.

      Poor responders constitute a significant and challenging population of women to treat with in
      vitro fertilization (IVF). This population includes women who respond sub-optimally to
      conventional ovarian stimulation with poor follicular recruitment. The estimated incidence of
      poor ovarian response ranges from 9-26%. Patients with PCOS are on the opposite end of the
      spectrum from poor responders. They are often exquisitely sensitive to ovarian stimulation
      and are predisposed to over-respond with the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
      (OHSS). Understanding the underlying mechanisms that enhance their sensitivity may provide
      insight into the treatment of poor responders. VEGF is a glycoprotein produced by ovarian
      granulosa cells that enhances vascular permeability and angiogenesis, and has been implicated
      in the pathogenesis of OHSS. After ovulation is triggered by LH or hCG, follicular expression
      of VEGF increases, which is crucial for corpus luteum function and steroidogenesis. However,
      excessive VEGF production can lead to third-space shifts of fluids, ascites, and other
      life-threatening features of OHSS. Serum concentrations and granulosa cell expression of VEGF
      have been shown to be higher in women with PCOS than in controls. Interestingly, compared
      with controls, patients with PCOS have also been shown to have lower levels of the
      neurotransmitter dopamine and dopamine D2 receptor levels in the ovary. Administration of
      dopamine D2 agonists has been shown in animal and human studies to decrease ovarian VEGF
      production and reduce the risk of OHSS. In this study, the investigators propose a novel
      approach of administering a dopamine D2 antagonist to poor responders to mimic the low
      dopaminergic tone of PCOS patients, with the goal of increasing VEGF production and
      follicular development during ovarian stimulation. Metoclopramide is a dopamine D2 antagonist
      with antiemetic and prokinetic properties and an established safety profile in pregnancy. The
      investigators hypothesis is that metoclopramide use prior to, and in conjunction with,
      conventional gonadotropin stimulation can improve IVF outcomes in poor responders.

    <description>Poor responders will be defined as women who have undergone a previous IVF cycle with fewer than 4 oocytes retrieved and at least one of the following two criteria: (1) advanced age (≥40 years) or any other risk factor for poor ovarian response and (2) abnormal ovarian reserve testing (antral follicle count (AFC) &lt; 5-7 or anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) level &lt; 3.6-7.9 pmol/L). Poor responders who will be undergoing a repeat IVF cycle will be recruited for the study with informed consent.
In the control arm, patients will undergo the same ovarian stimulation protocol as the previous IVF cycle in which they experienced a poor response. Starting 3 weeks prior to the first day of stimulation until the time of ovulation trigger (approximately 5 weeks overall), these patients will receive an oral placebo three times daily.</description>
