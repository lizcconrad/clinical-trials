      This is an open-label, follow-on phase 1 study to assess the long-term safety and
      tolerability of continuous i.c.v administration of 4 μg sNN0029/day in patients with ALS who
      previously participated in study sNN0029-003

      This is an open-label, follow-on phase 1 study to assess the long-term safety and
      tolerability of continuous i.c.v administration of sNN0029 infusion solution in patients with
      ALS.

      Eighteen patients who previously participated in study sNN0029-003 will receive continuous
      administration of 4 μg sNN0029/day via i.c.v. infusion with the Medtronic SynchroMed® II
      Infusion System. The sNN0029 infusion solution is intended to be an add-on treatment to other
      treatments for ALS.

      The assessments performed at the last visit in study sNN0029-003 will serve as the baseline
      values for patients included in study sNN0029-004 and be the start of sNN0029 treatment for
      all patients (Study Day 1; Visit 1). In order to not reveal the blind in study sNN0029-003,
      the patients will return to hospital on Day 3 and stay to Day 6 (Visit 2). During these days,
      the sNN0029 begins to exit the i.c.v. catheter tip in the ventricle of the brain.

      Patients will return to the hospital on Day 11 (Visit 3) for a refill of sNN0029 and
      adjustment of the infusion pump flow rate. After this, the patient will return to the clinic
      on Day 39 (Visit 4) for a sNN0029-refill of infusion pump and assessments. Thereafter the
      patients will visit the hospital on a monthly basis (every 28 days ± 2) to perform refills
      and make assessments every 3 months.

      Treatment in study sNN0029-004 may continue unless safety concerns warrant discontinuation of
      therapy, until patients choose to withdraw from the study, experience treatment related
      toxicity or intolerance, are deemed to be unsuitable to continue treatment by the
      investigator, or die

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation in sNN0029-003 with completion of 12 weeks study without
             clinically significant safety concerns

          2. Intact continuity of the Medtronic SynchroMed® II Infusion System as judged by X-ray
             of head and abdominal area

          3. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria

          4. Patient has been given written and verbal information about the continuation study,
             has had the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and
             procedural commitments

          5. Patient has given oral and / or signed consent (written) to participate in the study.
             In the event that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to
             sign the informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign
             the informed consent form on the patient's behalf

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic

          2. Ophthalmological examination (fundus photography, visual acuity and perimetry) with
             any clinically significant findings that imply safety concerns for this study.

          3. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus

          4. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that
             cannot be not managed optimally due to:

               -  Anatomical factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities,
                  neoplasms, or other abnormalities)

               -  Underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or platelet
                  count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other
                  medical conditions)

          5. Presence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism such as obesity (Body mass
             index [BMI] &gt; 35) or use of oestrogens including combined contraceptive pills

          6. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters
             as assessed by the investigator

          7. Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo study
             procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent

          8. For women only: pregnant, breast feeding and/or for fecund women unwillingness to use
             adequate contraception during the trial such as:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception
                  that do NOT contain oestrogens

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository
