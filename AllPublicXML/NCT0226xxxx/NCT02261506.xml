  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacteremia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill adults. Although
      bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) may arise from variable infectious foci (most
      commonly central vascular catheter related, lung, urinary tract, intra-abdominal, or skin and
      soft tissue sources), because of the high attendant morbidity and mortality of bacteremia,
      these patients collectively represent a critically important group to study.

      The consequences of the excessive antimicrobial use for individual patients, range from rash,
      gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea, to anaphylaxis, neutropenia, renal failure, toxic
      epidermal necrolysis, death, and a marked increase in ICU and hospital drug costs. One
      particularly concerning complication, Clostridium difficile infection, has increased in
      incidence and severity over the past decade. Much of this burden could be prevented through
      reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use.

      Another major consequence of excessive antibiotic use is antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic
      resistance is not only a concern for the patient who receives antibiotics, but also for
      neighbouring patients in the ICU, as well as future patients in the ICU and the hospital at
      large - through patient-to-patient transmission, and environmental contamination.

      No previous randomized controlled trials have directly compared shorter versus longer
      durations of antimicrobial treatment in these patients. The investigators will conduct a
      multi-center randomized concealed allocation trial of shorter duration (7 days) versus longer
      duration (14 days) antibiotic treatment for critically ill patients with bacteremia admitted
      to ICU. Eligible, patients will be randomized to either 7 days or 14 days of adequate
      antimicrobial treatment. The selection of type, dose and route of antibiotics will be at the
      discretion of the treating physicians, but the duration of treatment (7 versus 14 days) will
      be determined by randomization group. The randomization assignment will not be communicated
      to the study research coordinator, study critical care or infectious diseases investigators
      or clinicians until day 8. The primary outcome for the main trial will be 90-day mortality.

      The study will be initiated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, and
      then rolled out to a second site at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario. These
      sites will be sufficient to meet the sample size goals for the pilot RCT, but if additional
      funds are obtained the investigators will also roll out to the other Canadian ICUs listed
      below. The goal of adding these additional sites will be to increase the generalizability of
      the findings with respect to trial feasibility
