      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of
      nab®-paclitaxel (ABI-007) plus gemcitabine in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      have cholestatic hyperbilirubinemia secondary to bile duct obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 treatment cohorts in this study based on the predose total bilirubin levels on
      Cycle 1 Day 1 (Cohort 1 &gt; 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] to 3 x ULN bilirubin and Cohort 2
      &gt; 3 x ULN to 5 x ULN). Enrollment of subjects into Cohort 2 will only proceed after a review
      of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for all subjects in Cohort 1 has been completed
      by the Safety Monitoring Committee. The study is following a 3+3 dose escalation scheme
      within each dose level cohort group. A total of 3 subjects will initially be enrolled to the
      starting dose level in each cohort. The dose of the study regimen in each cohort will be
      escalated (or reduced) according to tolerability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced
             unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (islet cell neoplasms are
             excluded) that is measurable by RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines.

          2. Initial diagnosis of advanced stage disease must have occurred ≤ 6 weeks prior to
             starting Cycle 1 Day 1. NOTE: The clock for this time interval starts with the date of
             last evaluation confirming advanced disease (either biopsy or imaging results).

          3. Subject has confirmed cholestatic hyperbilirubenemia due to bile duct obstruction.
             Subjects who have liver dysfunction due to metastasis alone are excluded.

          4. Subject must have received no prior therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease.
             Prior treatment with 5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer during
             and up to 4 weeks after radiation therapy is allowed. If a subject received
             gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting, tumor recurrence must have occurred at least 6
             months after completing the last dose of gemcitabine.

          5. For those patients who had a biliary stent inserted, 2 stable bilirubin readings
             within 48 to 72 hours of each other taken at least 5 days and not more than 14 days
             post-stenting must be obtained. In addition, there should be no complications (eg,
             infection) present and bilirubin levels should have stabilized (2 readings with total
             bilirubin within 20% of each other) before administering first treatment.

          6. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent
             document (ICD).

          7. Subject has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood
             counts at screening (obtained ≤ 14 days prior to starting Cycle 1 Day 1):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 (1.5 × 109/L) cells/mm3;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 (100 × 109/L) cells/mm3;

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL.

          8. Subject has the following blood chemistry levels at screening (obtained ≤ 14 days
             prior to starting Cycle 1 Day 1):

               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 × ULN is allowed:

               -  Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2
                  for subjects with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional normal
                  value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used for
                  calculating creatinine clearance (eg, using the Cockroft-Gault formula). For
                  subjects with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2, lean body weight should be used
                  instead.

          9. Subject has acceptable coagulation studies (obtained ≤ 14 days prior to starting Cycle
             1 Day 1) partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.2 x ULN and INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

         10. Subject has no clinically significant abnormalities in urinalysis results (obtained ≤
             14 days prior to starting Cycle 1 Day 1).

         11. Subject has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70%.

         12. Significant or symptomatic amounts of ascites should be drained prior to Cycle 1 Day
             1. Pain symptoms should be stable and should not require modifications in analgesic
             management prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

         13. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1)
             has not undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral
             oophorectomy [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time
             during the preceding 24 consecutive months]) must:

               1. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with,
                  effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting IP
                  therapy (including dose interruptions), and while on study medication or for a
                  longer period if required by local regulations following the last dose of IP; and

               2. Have a negative serum pregnancy test (β -hCG) result at screening and agree to
                  ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after the end of
                  study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from
                  heterosexual contact.

         14. Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP
             discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

             * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g, calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

         15. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study
             related assessments/procedures being conducted.

             virus), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C or subject receiving immunosuppressive or
             myelosuppressive medications that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, increase
             the risk of serious neutropenic complications.

          5. Subject has undergone major surgery for any reason, other than diagnostic surgery (ie,
             surgery done to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4

             dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
             pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies.

         11. History of chronic leukemias (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia).

         12. Subject is enrolled in any other clinical protocol or investigational trial with an
