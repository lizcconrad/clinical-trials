    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a lifestyle intervention on gestational
      weight gain, postpartum weight loss, and other secondary outcomes relative to a usual care
      control group.

      Our study will address the following specific aims: (1) examine the impact of a lifestyle
      intervention on gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss in overweight and obese
      women, (2) examine the impact of the intervention on physical activity (PA), dietary intake,
      and quality of life (QOL), (3) examine race differences in total gestational weight gain, PA,
      dietary intake, and QOL; and (4) examine the impact of the intervention on offspring
      adiposity.

    <description>During pregnancy, participants complete one face-to-face counseling session, receive 10 behavioral podcasts, and receive weekly phone calls until delivery. Participants will be asked to attend one group session on breastfeeding. Participants will have the opportunity to participate in a private Facebook group during pregnancy and postpartum. During postpartum, participants complete one face-to-face counseling session, receive 16 behavioral podcasts, receive brief weekly check-in telephone calls for six weeks, and receive up to 8 telephone counseling calls through 6 months after delivery.</description>

    <description>Women will receive standard nutrition counseling provided by physicians, nurses, nutritionists, and counselors from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program (if applicable). They will receive a monthly study mailing that is educational in nature as well as podcasts related to a healthy pregnancy. During pregnancy, the mailings will focus on tips for a healthy pregnancy and on fetal development. During postpartum the mailings will focus on infant development and parenting. We will select a matched number of podcasts from Pea in the Podcast, commercially available podcasts. All mailings and podcasts will avoid discussion of weight, PA, or diet (except for foods to avoid in pregnancy for safety reasons).</description>
