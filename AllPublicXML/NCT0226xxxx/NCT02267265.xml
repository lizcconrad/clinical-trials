  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A child's early language environment is pivotal for language development. Disparities in
      early language environments contribute to the gap in school readiness between poor and more
      advantaged children. Ultimately this leads to disparities in students' school achievement and
      economic outcomes. While recent research has highlighted the value of early intervention for
      children in disadvantaged families, most existing interventions begin too late, reach only a
      small proportion of children at risk, and do not capitalize on the critical role that parent
      language plays in a child's educational trajectory. To address this challenge, the
      investigators propose to develop and evaluate a novel language-based, perinatal public health
      intervention, Thirty Million Words Newborn Initiative (TMW-NI). It is proposed that new
      mothers will receive this educational intervention while their babies are undergoing the
      universal newborn hearing screen. The intervention will use video, animation, and interactive
      questions to convey the importance of the early language environment and to illustrate
      strategies parents can use to promote language learning. The investigators will conduct
      formative research with mothers of low socioeconomic status (low-SES) and with healthcare
      providers to inform the content and format of the intervention prototype. Also critical for
      acceptability, the investigators will use an iterative approach to develop the intervention,
      with review of the work-in-progress by the intended audience. To assess feasibility and
      initial efficacy, the investigators will conduct a randomized-controlled trial with low-SES
      mothers during the newborn period. The investigators hypothesize that TMW-NI will positively
      impact parents' knowledge and beliefs about the role of language input for a child's language
      development.

    <description>The treatment group will complete a demographics questionnaire and the knowledge survey before the intervention. Participants will then view the 10 minute TMW-Newborn Intervention video around the time of the newborn hearing screening. Participants whose newborn does not pass the hearing screen will view an additional 3 minute video detailing the importance of following up for an outpatient re-screening. The participant will complete the knowledge survey again before discharge, and after approximately four to six weeks.</description>

Participants will subsequently view the 10-minute Safe Sleep for your Baby (SIDS) educational video. It is an educational video developed by the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) promoting the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This will be around the time of the newborn hearing screening. Participants will complete the knowledge survey again before discharge, and after approximately four to six weeks.</description>
