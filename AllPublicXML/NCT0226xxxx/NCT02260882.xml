  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if revaccination with pneumococcal vaccine
      (PNEUMOVAX™ 23, V110) is well tolerated and produces an immune response in older Japanese
      adults. The primary hypothesis being tested is that the geometric mean concentration of
      antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes 3, 6B, and 23F at 4 weeks after
      revaccination will be superior to that before revaccination in Japanese adults who received a
      primary vaccination at least 5 years before revaccination.
