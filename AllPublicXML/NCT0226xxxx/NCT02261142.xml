  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a common consequence of injury to the central nervous system and can be a major
      problem in motor function and everyday activities. A method for treating spasticity that
      applies low-amplitude electrical stimulation through a garment with built-in electrodes,
      Mollii® (Elektrodress), has been developed. The garment is to be used in combination with
      individualized training and the stimulation is mainly given to antagonists of spastic
      muscles.

      The general objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of and costs associated with
      the Mollii® treatment of spasticity due to stroke or cerebral palsy.

      Primary objectives are;

        -  to study whether treatment with the Mollii® improves function and activity

        -  to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment, from both a health-care perspective
           and a societal perspective.

      Secondary objectives are;

        -  to study whether there are differences in treatment effect between the stroke and the
           Cerebral Palsy groups in a subgroup-analysis

        -  to assess compliance with treatment

        -  to report any adverse effects.

      This study is designed as a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over trial (RCT). This part of
      the study takes 12 weeks (6 weeks of active treatment and 6 weeks of non-active treatment)
      and is followed by a wash-out period of 6 weeks. An uncontrolled,open phase starts after week
      18, where patients are followed one year after inclusion.

      30 participants with spasticity due to Stroke and Cerebral Palsy will be included.

      Two centers are recruiting participants and are collecting data.

      Outcome measures are chosen to reflect the different dimensions in the International
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and patient reported outcome
      measures (PROM).
