  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized controlled trial. Approximately 102 patients will be
      randomized to one of two treatment groups: cooled radiofrequency or conventional monopolar
      radiofrequency ablation. Patients with chronic knee pain, with moderate to severe
      osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence scale for at least 6 months who have failed
      conservative therapy will be screened for the study.

      Then, patients will be enrolled based on reporting ≥50% pain relief after a fluoroscopic
      guided single diagnostic block of the geniculate nerves (superior medial, superior lateral,
      and inferior medial) with 0.5 ml of local anesthetic (2% Lidocaine).

      Baseline data will be collected for all enrolled patients. Outcomes will be measured at 1, 4,
      12, 24 and 52 weeks.

      Outcome measures will be: Visual analogue scale (VAS) both while at rest and during
      ambulation, Oxford knee scores, WOMAC, and global perceived effect.

    <description>Patient is placed in supine position on a fluoroscopic table with a pillow under the popliteal fossa. An anterio-posterior fluoroscopic view of the tibio-femoral joint is obtained. Skin and subcutaneous tissues are anesthetized and a 17 g introducer needle is advanced percutaneously towards the junction of shaft with epicondyle until bone contact is made. The needle is then laterally displaced away from the bone. This process is performed at the superior medial and superior lateral aspects of the femur, and the inferior medial aspect of the tibia. The fluoroscope is placed in lateral view to guide the needle depth to be at the medial third of the femur or tibia. A cooled radiofrequency probe from a Pain Management Radiofrequency kit is advanced through the introducer. Following sensory and motor stimulation, cooled genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation is carried out at 60 Celsius for 150 seconds.</description>

The fluoroscope is placed in lateral view to guide the needle depth to be at the medial third of the femur or tibia. A conventional radiofrequency probe from a Pain Management Radiofrequency kit is advanced through the introducer. Following sensory and motor stimulation, genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation will be carried out at 80 Celsius for 90 seconds.</description>

    <intervention_name>Genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Radiofrequency ablation uses the electrical field generated by a radiofrequency probe inserted near a nerve responsible for pain. Chronic pain sensation in the knee is generated at the genicular nerves. The physician locates the affected genicular nerve by injecting an anesthetic (lidocaine) that produces a sensory nerve block (i.e. anesthetic pain relief). A radiofrequency probe is inserted percutaneously near the affected nerve using a cannula/introducer and is then connected to a radiofrequency generator. This is set to stimulate sensory and motor response, which allows the physician to adjust the probe position for effective and safe treatment. Then radiofrequency is applied to the tissue for a short time (up to 150 seconds) in order to generate a target temperature (no more than 80 degrees Celsius). The increase in the temperature of the tissue ablates the affected nerve producing pain relief.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pain Management Radiofrequency Kit</intervention_name>
    <description>The pain management radiofrequency consists of a radiofrequency generator, a radiofrequency probe and an introducer/cannula. The introducer cannula is used to percutaneously position the probe in the appropriate location for treatment. The radiofrequency probe is an electrode that delivers the electric field that heats up the tissue. In cooled radiofrequency the electrode is surrounded by a water jacket that cools it while heat is generated. The generator is the instrument that provides the radiofrequency according to a particular temperature and time program. Temperature, tissue impedance and radiofrequency power are lalso monitored by the generator.</description>
