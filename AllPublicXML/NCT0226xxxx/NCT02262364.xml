      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of a single injection of APS in
      patients with painful unilateral knee osteoarthritis and who have not been able to get
      satisfactory pain relief with other treatments through one-month post treatment and monitor
      subjects for adverse events through 12 months.

          -  Systemic steroid use within 2 weeks of screening.

          -  Planned/anticipated surgery of the index knee during the study period.
