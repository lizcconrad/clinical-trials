    <textblock>
      70 overweight or obese adults with sleep disorders will be recruited for this study, in which
      the investigators aim to compare wrist actigraphy with polysomnography (PSG) for sleep
      monitoring. It is to evaluate the applications of Jawbone Up2 with the sleep parameters
      derived from this actigraphy.

      As an observation study, it will recruit 70 overweight or obese patients with sleep disorders
      who meet the selection criteria: clinical records and AIS at a tertiary hospital. The
      patients will sign the informed consent form. The involved patients and doctors will receive
      related training.

      These patients will receive the sleep monitoring from 21:00 to 6:00 in sleep monitoring
      laboratory in Ruijin Hospital. They will receive the PSG and Jawbone Up 2 sleep monitoring at
      the same time. Sleep parameters derived from actigraphy and PSG will be compared in multiple
      night recordings such as total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency,
      awakening, sleep efficiency, total time in bed,. The aim is to assess the validation of
      actigraphy in overweight or obese patients with sleep disorders.
