      Main study: To investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of BEA 2180 BR Sub-study; To investigate whether treatment with 36 μg tiotropium bromide
      is able to protect of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction compared to baseline
      (methacholine challenge at screening).
