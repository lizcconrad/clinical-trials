      This study is to investigate sex hormones levels of Chinese patients with invasive breast
      cancer.The aim is to analyze biochemical monitoring results of premenopausal and
      postmenopausal patients to facilitate determination of menopausal status and propose clinical
      application.

      Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2) and luteinizing hormone (LH) can serve as
      indicators in the determination of menopausal status. NCCN clinical practice guidelines for
      breast cancer recommend detecting the levels of FSH and E2 for amenorrhea patients less than
      60 years of age. But the detection method and the corresponding reference ranges indicating
      postmenopausal status are not mentioned. In addition, the reference limits vary a lot among
      different equipments and methods when it comes to diagnosis of menopause, thus it is
      difficult to set universal criteria. So in this study, four widely used methods and
      instruments in China are used to detect plasma levels of FSH, E2 and LN of premenopausal and
      postmenopausal patients. Instruments and methods must be one of the following four
      categories: microparticle chemiluminescent(Beckman),acridinium ester chemiluminescence
      (Siemens),acridinium ester chemiluminescence (Abbott) and electrochemiluminescence（Roche）.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Invasive breast cancer patients confirmed through pathology.

          -  For postmenopausal group: patients at the age ≥ 60 years with more than one year of
             menopause, or patients having undergone bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  For premenopausal group: patients with regular menses during recent 3 months and
             having never received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue therapy.

          -  Patients who meet the above criteria can be enrolled whether they have received
             anti-cancer treatment or not.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients less than 60 years old who are amenorrhoeic but have not received bilateral
             oophorectomy or medical castration.
