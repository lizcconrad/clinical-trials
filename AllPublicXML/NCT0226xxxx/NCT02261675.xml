  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to define the interaction of intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine,
      an a2-adrenergic agonist, and sevoflurane in children having surgery by using the minimum
      alveolar concentration which can block adrenergic and cardiovascular responses to
      incision(MACbar) of sevoflurane as the measure of anesthetic potency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators observed the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on the minimum
      alveolar concentration of sevoflurane to blockade adrenergic response to surgical incision in
      50% of children (MACBAR). And to explore the safety of use of dexmedetomidine in pediatric
      patients.

    <description>A predetermined steady-state end-tidal sevoflurane concentration(4%) was maintained for at least 15 min before skin incision.we observed the change in Mean Blood Pressure or Heart rate to determined the next end-tidal sevoflurane concentration.Followed the modified Dixon up and down method to obtain MACBAR of every child.The MACBAR of sevoflurane and its 95% confidence interval were calculated by Sum Average method.</description>
