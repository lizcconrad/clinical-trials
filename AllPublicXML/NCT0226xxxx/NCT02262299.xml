      Treatment failure during the study is defined as one or more of the following:

        -  Redo transplantation

        -  Death due to respiratory causes

        -  Initiation of rescue therapy for worsening of BOS (worsening of BOS defined as a decline
           of at least 600mL in 3 consecutive months) o Photophoresis, Montelukast or other
           treatment considered as rescue therapy by the investigator

      Statistical Methods Imputation:

      In the ITT primary endpoint analysis, missing data due to treatment failure and death will be
      imputed as 50% of baseline FEV1. For patients lost to follow-up or who withdrew from the
      study for reasons not related to BOS, the last measured FEV1 (ml) will be imputed as the 6
      month value.

      Sample Size calculation:

      Assumptions:

        1. SD: To determine the SD of the FEV1 decline in the population, the 5 members of the
           Steering committee collected the data from patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Mean
           decline in FEV1 (in a 6 month period) in this sample was 561 ml and the SD of the
           decline was 300 ml .

        2. Treatment effect: A meaningful treatment effect of 50% should be expected based on the
           mechanism of disease and preliminary data in BOS (In the publication) and personal
           experience.

      One standard deviation (SD) of FEV1 in groups will be assumed to be 300 mL based on data from
      expert centers.

      Monthly decline in FEV1 at onset of BOS is assumed to be approximately 75 ml, in 6 months 450
      ml decline in FEV1 is expected for the placebo group.

      A treatment effect of 50% reduction in decline is expected with Pirfenidone, which will lead
      to an expected mean decline of 225 ml in 6 months.

      With a beta error of 12% (power 88%) the study will be able to detect a difference of 225 ml
      between the two treatment groups with a sample size of 36 patients in each group using a
      two-sided t-test with significance level of 0.05. An estimated 80 patients will be recruited
      to the trial allowing for a drop-out rate of 10%.

      Concomitant treatment - Stopping Azithromycin will be allowed if not tolerated. Standard
      treatment is continuation of Azithromycin.

        -  Initiation on new bronchodilator therapy is not allowed

        -  Photopheresis and Montelukast are not allowed while on Pirfenidone Study Committees
           Steering Committee: M. Perch, P. Corris, G. Verleden, J. Gotlieb and E Verschuuren
           Patient Review Committee Inclusion Criteria, exclusion criteria and BOS staging for all
           patients enrolled will be reviewed by a committee.

      Clinical Events Committee Group of physicians who will review the serious adverse events that
      occur during the study to adjudicate their relationship to the study drug.

      DSMB Independent group to review the safety and efficacy data during the study.
