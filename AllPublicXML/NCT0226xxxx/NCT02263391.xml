    <textblock>
      This study gathers information about HIV testing utilization and influences on HIV testing
      decisions among young, general population Russian women at-risk of HIV exposure. The study
      compares HIV testing acceptance across two types of low-barrier testing strategies (opt-in
      vs. opt-out) and conducts one of the first randomized experimental comparisons of these
      strategies. The overarching goal is to gain knowledge that can be used to increase
      utilization of HIV testing among at-risk young women and offer gender-specific strategies for
      improving prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses an adaptive design. That is, the procedures and phases of the study
      experienced by a participant depend to some extent on their responses to earlier phases.
      Ultimately, this design yields a number of practice relevant pathways and endpoints, each of
      which has a testing rate associated with it.

      Phase-I is initial screening for risk status, collecting background data, and ascertaining
      whether there has been recent independent HIV testing. If there has been independent testing,
      information about the independent testing is collected and the participant's involvement is
      complete.

      Those who are not independent testers enter Phase-II. Phase II will include: randomization to
      opt-in vs. opt-out conditions; a survey asking about reasons for acceptance or
      non-acceptance; participating in a focus group in which participants who have not accepted
      HIV testing (non-accepters) and those who accepted (accepters) will be asked to discuss their
      health beliefs related to HIV prevention, barriers and reasons for testing/not testing; then
      (5) after the focus group is complete, privately offer another testing opportunity to
      non-accepters, under the same opt-in or opt-out strategy to which they previously were
      randomized. The design was selected in order simultaneously answer a number of questions that
      we believe will be important for engineering a testing and prevention strategy suitable for
      testing in a subsequent study: (1) identify key attitudes, beliefs and knowledge (survey);
      (2) contrast opt-in and opt-out strategies (randomized trial); (3) generate qualitative data
      about reasons for decisions in the women's own words (focus group); and (4) identify any
      incremental benefit related to peer discussion.

    <description>Women's decision to take/not take a health screening test/HIV test is recorded. If a woman chooses to be tested, she will be asked a few questions to assess her reasons for being tested. She will be provided with the results of the testing. If a woman's test is positive for HIV (or other health risks in the bundled opt-out condition), counseling with a trained study nurse, physician or psychologist will be available on-site and a referral for additional testing, counseling, and appropriate medical care will be provided.</description>

    <description>Common barriers to HIV screening testing will be removed as much as possible (i.e., providing rapid testing, results shortly available, testing on-site, confidentiality). The research assistant will say: &quot;There is voluntary HIV testing available to all study participants if you wish to do it. It is free, private, it is only a finger stick, and you will learn your HIV results in just minutes.&quot; Participants will be scheduled for a two-hour appointment to complete the written consent procedure, enroll in the study, and participate in the study activities, testing and a focus group.</description>

We recommend all of them for everyone, but you can choose to decline any or all of them. This is free, private, it is only a finger stick, and you will learn your results for all the tests in just minutes.&quot; Participants will be scheduled for a two-hour appointment to complete the written consent procedure, enroll in the study, and participate in the study activities, testing and a focus group.</description>
