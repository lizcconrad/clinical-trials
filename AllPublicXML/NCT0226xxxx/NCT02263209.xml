        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for cementless primary total hip arthroplasty according to the Surgical
             Technique brochure (Appendix 10): &quot;The Taperloc Porous Primary Hip and Exceed ABT
             Taperfit Prostheses are marketed for non-cemented use in skeletally mature patients
             undergoing primary hip replacement surgery of non inflammatory degenerative joint
             disease.&quot;

          -  Under 80 and over 40 years of age

          -  A pre-operative level of pain and function the same as for conventional joint
             replacement.

          -  A likelihood of obtaining relief of pain and improved function

          -  Full skeletal maturity

          -  Ability to follow instructions

          -  Good general health for age

          -  Willing to return for follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to any antibiotics

          -  Active infection

          -  Revision arthroplasty

          -  Marked bone loss which could preclude or compromise adequate fixation of the device

          -  Uncooperative subjects

          -  Parkinson's Disease

          -  Vascular insufficiency of the affected limb, which could compromise bony
             ingrowth/implant fixation, i.e., diabetes.

          -  Severe instability or deformity of the ligaments and/or surrounding soft tissue which
             may preclude stability of the device

          -  Pregnancy

          -  BMI &gt; 40

          -  Use of immunosuppressive drugs
