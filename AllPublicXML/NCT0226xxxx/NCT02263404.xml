  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality of any psychiatric disorder and a paucity of
      effective treatments. AN becomes intractable in around 20%, resulting in huge individual and
      healthcare costs. The study will help patients with severe AN using DBS. Individuals with
      severe intractable AN will be eligible to take part in the study.
