      This study is an observational study conducted prospectively under routine clinical setting
      for 1 year with about 700 patients diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease who will be treated by
      donepezil (Aricept) as monotherapy. The subjects will be recruited in the selected
      institutions of about 8 countries in Asia.

      Participation in this study places no additional visit schedule, which will be determined by
      the investigator's judgment based on the disease progression of each subject. Investigators
      educate subjects to keep decided visit schedule, and collect the required information for
      case record from (CRF) on the visit.
