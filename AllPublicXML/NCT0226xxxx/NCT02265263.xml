      The research leading consortium to these results has received funding from the European Union
      Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no 602461 (www.biocog.eu).

      The investigators will establish valid biomarkers panels (neuroimaging and molecular) for
      risk and clinical outcome prediction of postoperative delirium (POD)/postoperative cognitive
      deficit (POCD) in elective surgical patients (Age ≥ 65 years) in study centers in
      Berlin,Germany (data collection within 5 years after initial hospital stay) and Utrecht, The
      Netherlands (data collection within 1 year after initial hospital stay), thereof
      cerebrospinal fluid (only once on day of surgery in patients with planned spinal
      anesthesia/combined spinal epidural analgesia in n = 200 patients, only in Berlin).
      Post-mortem samples of brain tissue are analyzed in a limited number of voluntary patients,
      only in Berlin.

      A control group of ASA II/III- patients is collected for measuring the learning experience
      during the cognitive testings. The participants are matched on age, education, and gender to
      the study patients. The ASA II/III- control patients receive additionally MRI-scan (3 Tesla)
      at baseline, after 3 months and after 1, 2 and 5 years.

      To analyze scanner variability we additionally measure 20 subjects (Age ≥ 65 years, ASA I and
      II) from Berlin in the MRI scanner (3-Tesla) in Utrecht und vice versa 20 subjects (Age ≥ 65
      years, ASA I and II) from Utrecht in the MRI scanner (3-Tesla) in Berlin.

      A study group (n= 80) and matched control group of (n=80, patients ASA II and III) patients
      is collected for measuring 7 Tesla MRI at two timepoints (Baseline and 90 days).The primary
      endponit of this substudy is gamma amino-butyric acid concentration in CNS after 3-months
      (measured by MRI). A retrospective control group (extracting 800 intensive care unit patient
      data from the patient data management system during the BioCog study period) to analyse
      economic effects that are caused by the implementation of quality indicators in health care.

      An interim-analysis is performed on the primary endpoint after 400 included patients.

      The resulting (multivariate) expert system is expected: 1) to support clinical
      decision-making in patient care, e.g. to balance the individual POD/POCD risk against the
      expected overall clinical outcome of an (elective) surgical intervention, 2) to allow the
      design of more sophisticated and hypothesis-driven clinical studies and drug trials
      (translational research) in the future. The latter will be possible on the basis of
      biomarker-based sub-grouping of patients and a better understanding of relevant
      pathophysiological processes.

      Furthermore, a state-of-the art clinical database and biobank will be created that does not
      yet exist worldwide. Both the expert system and the reference database/biobank will expand
      the leadership of the contributing academic institutions in this particular research area. In
      addition, the newly created biobank will become an integral part of the European Biobanking
      and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI) which allows top address specific
      and hypothesis-driven research questions.

      Most notably, the developed (multivariate) expert system also has the potential for
      commercialization. Possible customers are: 1) physicians and hospital departments being
      involved in pre-surgical decision making, 2) pharmaceutical industry intending to conduct
      biomarker-based drug trials in POD/POCD.
