  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators are conducting a research study to learn about the safety and benefit of
      using a medication called buprenorphine for patient with difficult to treat depression . This
      research study is testing whether combining two medications will be effective in treating
      depression when initial treatment with just one antidepressant does not relieve the
      depressive symptoms ; this is what is called &quot; difficult to treat depression &quot; or &quot; treatment
      resistant depression &quot;. The two medication the investigators are using are &quot; an
      anti-depressant medication called venlafaxine XR ( the generic form of Effexor ) and
      buprenorphine . Buprenorphine is a medication that is FDA approved for the treatment of
      opioid dependence. The investigators are testing whether adding buprenorphine to venlafaxine
      enhances treatment response.

      The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of
      buprenorphine (BPN) as a novel treatment for late-life treatment resistant depression
      (LL-TRD). The investigators aim to use a clinical trial methodology common to all three
      sites, and to examine the mechanism of action (MOA) of BPN using translational neuroscience
      methods. Over Â½ of seniors with depression fail to respond to traditional
      antidepressants.19,20 Modulation of the opiate system with BPN offers a novel mechanistic
      approach to improve the lives of patients with LL-TRD, with a safety profile potentially
      superior to current augmentation strategies such as antipsychotics, lithium, ECT, and
      surgical interventions (e.g., deep brain or vagal nerve stimulation).
