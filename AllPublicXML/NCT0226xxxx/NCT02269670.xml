  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well everolimus and hormone therapy work in treating patients
      with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has continued to spread (progressed) or
      returned after a period of improvement (recurred) on everolimus and exemestane hormone
      therapy. Everolimus is a chemotherapy drug that may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen and progesterone are hormones
      that can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer by
      lowering the amount of estrogen and progesterone the body makes. Giving everolimus with a
      different type of hormone therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer in patients
      who progressed on everolimus with exemestane.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Progression free survival in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer receiving
      everolimus plus hormonal therapy beyond first progression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Clinical benefit rate (sum of stable disease, partial response, complete response).

        2. Response rate (partial response and complete response).

        3. Overall survival.

        4. Safety, side effects and tolerability profile of everolimus.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) daily and a hormone therapy regimen chosen at the
      discretion of the investigator (anastrozole PO daily; letrozole PO daily; tamoxifen citrate
      PO daily; fulvestrant intramuscularly [IM] or PO on days 1, 15, and 29, and then monthly;
      megestrol acetate PO 4 times daily [QID]; or other regimen). Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
