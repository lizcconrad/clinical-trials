  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of live music in SICU might affect the perception of noise, which may reduce staff's
      stress level and further decrease the possibility of clinical errors, reduce patient's
      anxiety and perception of pain as well as increase compliance from patient and family. Live
      music might also enhance the quality of stay and promote a holistic healing process for the
      patient.

      In this study, we are looking at the effect of the live music provided by a trained music
      therapist, created through incorporating the noises in the SICU - such as the beeping of the
      machines as part of the elements in the music, to organize the sound environment as well as
      introducing familiar songs, chosen according to the cultures and ages of the patients,
      caregivers and staff, to increase a sense of familiarity and comfort. Through the
      intervention, we hope to ameliorate the sound environment, which may reduce the stress level
      of the staff and increase their acuity level while decrease patients and caregivers' anxiety
      level and improve their mood state and the quality of hospitalization
