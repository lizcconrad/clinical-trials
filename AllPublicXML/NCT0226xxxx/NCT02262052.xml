      The Theia-study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm management (cohort) study.

      Consecutive patients with clinically suspected acute, recurrent, ipsilateral, proximal deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT), who fulfil all the inclusion criteria and meet none of the exclusion
      criteria, are eligible for inclusion and will be managed according to the result of a
      magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI) of the affected leg. The MRDTI is to be
      performed and adjudicated within 24 hours of study inclusion. The final treatment decision
      will be made based on this ruling of the MRDTI. In case of a positive MRDTI signal, patients
      will be treated with therapeutically dosed anticoagulants. Patients with a negative MRDTI
      ruling will be subjected to a standardized compression ultrasonography (CUS) within 48 hours
      after initial presentation. The latter CUS serves as a reference test in case the patient
      returns with symptoms of ipsilateral recurrence in the future, and will not be used for
      management decisions at baseline. The study flowchart can be found in Appendix A.

      All patients will be followed for three months for the occurrence of acute recurrent venous
      thrombo-embolism (VTE). In case of suspected recurrent VTE, objective testing including
      either computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE or CUS for DVT will be
      performed. Additionally, in case of a proven ipsilateral recurrent DVT during follow-up,
      MRDTI will be repeated.

    <measure>a formal cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>This model will be based on the primary and secondary endpoints, scored after a follow-up period of 3 months (post-hoc analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>A Markov model will be developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness MRDTI versus ultrasonography. The model will follow the patients through the course of disease in a maximum of two three-month cycles, and will include all relevant clinical outcomes and incorporated health states stratified by diagnostic management. Clinical events included in the model are fatal PE, recurrent VTE, major bleeds and clinically relevant non-major. The model includes clinical and cost outcomes, along with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMBs).</description>
