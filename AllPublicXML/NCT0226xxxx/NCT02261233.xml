  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop sensitive and objective clinical research
      tools for the assessment of postural control of the trunk. In order to accomplish this goal,
      we aim to quantify balance performance in an unstable seated task. Specifically, the
      investigators will quantify balance performance in low back pain participants before and
      after osteopathic manipulative treatment. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a
      significant improvement in balance performance after a single session of osteopathic
      manipulative treatment as well as after 4 sessions of osteopathic manipulative treatment and
      this improvement will be greater than any learning effect.

      A secondary objective of this study is to quantify differences in patient-oriented outcome
      measures (e.g., self-reported pain, disability) in low back pain participants before and
      after osteopathic manipulative treatment. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a
      significant improvement in these self-reported outcomes following osteopathic manipulative
      treatment. The association between improvement in postural control parameters and
      patient-oriented measures will also be explored.
