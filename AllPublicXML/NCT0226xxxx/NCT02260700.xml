  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug
      enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) and the relative-bioavailability (the
      extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-54861911
      solid dosage formulation compared with JNJ 54861911 oral suspension formulation in healthy
      older male participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, single-dose and 3-way Crossover
      (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence) study to
      determine the bioavailability of JNJ-54861911 solid dosage formulation in healthy older male
      participants. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (that is, 28 days before
      study commences on Day 1), an open-label treatment Phase (consists of 3 single-dose treatment
      periods, either a single oral suspension formulation [Treatment A] or solid formulation 25
      milligram (mg) dose of JNJ-54861911 under fasted [Treatment B] or fed conditions [Treatment
      C] in subsequent 3-treatment periods; each treatment period separated with washout period of
      6 days) and follow-up Phase (7 to 14 days after last dose administration). The maximal study
      duration for a participant will not exceed 8 weeks. All the eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 treatment sequences. Followed by an overnight fast of at
      least 10 hours participants will be administered with study treatment under fasted condition
      or fed condition (30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast). Participants will not
      be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected
      for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment.
      Bioavailability will be primarily evaluated by pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI; weight [kilogram(kg)]/height^2 [meter square (m^2)]) between 18
             and 30 kg/m^2, (inclusive)

          -  Be healthy for their age group with or without medication on the basis of physical
             examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
             performed at Screening or admission. Minor deviations in ECG, which are not considered
             to be of clinical significance to the investigator, are acceptable

          -  Be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel [including liver enzymes], hematology, or
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participants'
             source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Men who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and have not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control for example, either
             condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository,
             and all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after
             receiving the last dose of study drug. In addition, their female partners should also
             use an appropriate method of birth control for at least the same duration

          -  Participants' must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they
             understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or
             12 lead ECG (including QTc greater than (&gt;) 450msec, Left Bundle Branch Block,
             permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator) at Screening or
             admission

          -  Participant has a history of or current liver or renal insufficiency; significant
             cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication, herbal medication, vitamins,
             or mineral supplements within 14 days prior to study drug administration (not
             including paracetamol). Medication for chronic use in age related disease will be
             allowed after approval by both the investigator and to the sponsor. No change in dose
             or regimen will be permitted during the study that is, from the Screening visit until
             the follow-up visit

          -  Participant has a history of spontaneous, prolonged or severe bleeding of unclear
             origin

          -  Participant has a history of epilepsy or fits or unexplained black-outs other than
             vasovagal collapse
