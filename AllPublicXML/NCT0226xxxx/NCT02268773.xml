        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant disease. (A significant disease is defined as a disease
             which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study
             or the subject's ability to participate in the study)

             findings

             transferase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 34 µmol/L or creatinine &gt; 176 µmol/L
             regardless of clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not be conducted
             in these subjects

          -  Use of dipyridamole, aspirin or any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID)
             during the previous two weeks

          -  Active peptic ulceration or history of peptic ulcer disease

          -  Known history of or suspected hypersensitivity to dipyridamole, aspirin, any NSAID or
             any other component of the test drugs

          -  History of any bleeding disorders

          -  History of cerebral haemorrhage

          -  Resting, seated blood pressure less than 90/60 mmHg

          -  Participation in any drug clinical trial within sixteen weeks prior to the start of
             the trial

          -  Any indication of current or previous abuse of alcohol, solvents or drugs

          -  Any chronic illness

          -  Asthma

          -  Requirement for any other medication one month before or during the study

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically

             surgically sterile) were to be excluded

          -  Previous participation in the randomisation phase of this clinical trial
