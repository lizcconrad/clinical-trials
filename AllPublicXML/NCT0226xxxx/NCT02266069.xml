      It is important to provide high quality palliative care to all patients with a non-curable
      and life-limiting condition. The Care Pathway for Primary Palliative Care (CPPPC) provides
      tools for health care professionals to help them delivering palliative care timely and
      accurately.This study investigates whether the implementation of the CPPPC really helps to
      improve patients' lifes.
