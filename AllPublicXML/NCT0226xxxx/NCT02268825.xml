  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial to assess MTD of MK-3475 in combination with mFOLFOX6
      followed by a safety expansion open label, nonrandomized trial with MK-3475 at MTD in
      combination with mFOLFOX6 and supplemental celecoxib in 4 cohorts of advanced/metastatic GI
      malignancies (pancreatic, gastro esophageal, colorectal/appendiceal adenocarcinoma and
      biliary carcinoma) to assess response rate, clinical benefit rate, progression free survival
      and overall survival. The safety expansion cohort will assess the effect of the addition of
      celecoxib to patients that do not respond to combination MK-3475/mFOLFOX treatment.
