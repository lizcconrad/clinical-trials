  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled 6-month trial of the efficacy of a novel intervention
      combining neuroplasticity-based cognitive training with aerobic exercise, compared to the
      same systematic cognitive training alone. The primary treatment targets are overall cognitive
      deficit level and independent living skills. The investigators hypothesize that combining
      neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training and neurotrophin-enhancing physical
      exercise will produce large cognitive and functional improvements, even relative to cognitive
      training alone. Adding aerobic exercise to a cognitive training program will have the
      additional benefit of helping to ameliorate medication side effects, reduce the risk for
      developing metabolic syndrome, and help to prevent the deterioration in physical health that
      usually follows the onset of schizophrenia and its pharmacologic treatment. The investigators
      target the period shortly after a first episode of schizophrenia to maximize the
      generalization of cognitive improvement to functional outcome, before chronic disability is
      established.

      The Cognitive Training and Exercise intervention involves 24 weeks of systematic computerized
      cognitive training, 4 hours per week, plus aerobic exercise, four 30 minute sessions per
      week. The first 12 weeks involves neurocognitive training, using auditory training exercises
      from Posit Science Brain HQ. The second 12 weeks involves social cognitive training, using
      the Posit Science SocialVille modules. Aerobic exercise occurs as two 30-minute sessions at
      the clinic and two at home weekly. Intensity of aerobic exercise is tailored to maintain an
      individualized target heart rate zone and is monitored by a heart rate recorder. A weekly
      one-hour Bridging Skills Group with other members of the treatment condition is designed to
      aid generalization of training to everyday life situations.
