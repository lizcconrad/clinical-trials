  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 35 healthcare workers who had systemic reactions to influenza vaccine
      the last 2 times they were vaccinated, to ask whether influenza vaccine is indeed associated
      with systemic reactions in these workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trials of split virus vaccines in healthy adults have not been able to
      detect an increase in systemic adverse events compared to control vaccination. These trials
      do identify a non-trivial risk of systemic symptoms occurring in the week after both placebo
      and vaccine. There is a small population of healthcare workers who report consistent systemic
      symptoms after split virus vaccination which may occur because a small group of healthy
      adults have true physical reactions to components of the vaccine or excipients. If this is
      true, then alternatives - such as the use of subunit vaccines or live attenuated nasal spray
      vaccines - might be expected to be better tolerated by these people.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Employed or volunteer in a healthcare facility or an ambulatory care setting providing
             healthcare

          -  By self report, have had 2 or more doses of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
             (TIIV) in the last 15 years, and after at least the last 2 vaccine doses have had the
             same systemic adverse event in the 7 days after vaccination, including: fever, chills,
             myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, or insomnia;

          -  Consent to the study, including two injections one month apart, with one being placebo
             and one a dose of TIIV;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a contraindication to TIIV (previous allergic reaction to a dose of vaccine, or
             Guillain Barre syndrome with onset within 6 weeks of vaccination);

          -  Has previously received a dose of TIIV for the current influenza season.

          -  Receipt of another vaccine, or initiation of new medication within 7 days of the study
             injection (participant may enter the study as long as the gap between other
             vaccine/initiation of new medication is &gt;7 days);

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness or active infection or fever (temperature â‰¥37.8oC) on
             the day a dose of study medication due (participant may receive injection 48 hours
             after symptoms have resolved and body temperature has returned to normal without the
             use of antipyretics.
