  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer, with more than 70,000 new cases and 8900 deaths a year in France, is a major
      public health problem. Until 28% of patients treated with surgery will present a positive
      surgical margin resulting in an incomplete clearance of the tumoral process and exposing so
      the patient at a local, systemic recurrence and increased morbidity. An increasing number of
      international publications have shown (ICG) was interesting for the detection of the sentinel
      lymph node, in the surgery of tumors of type hepatocarcinoma and liver metastases from
      colorectal diseases, but also in the surgery of the kidney, bladder or breast. ICG has
      affinity for tumor and tissues around the tumor related to micro-vascular histology for a
      localized and specific deposit (EPR effect).

      The detection of ICG 's deposits is now possible with to the use of a device which allow to
      visualize the infra-red fluorescence (NIR; Near Infra-Red) for objects larger than 0.15 mm.
      Thanks to this feature, the location of residual tumor tissue when performing a radical
      prostatectomy could be made much easier.

      The ability of ICG to detect a surgical margin positive intraoperatively has never be
      evaluated. We want to perform a monocentric prospective ex-vivo pilot in order to evaluate
      the diagnostic performance of fluorescence in the detection of surgical margins compared to
      pathologic analysis. This study will be conducted in 37 patients operated on for a radical
      prostatectomy after systemic injection of 0, 25 mg/Kg of ICG 24 h before the surgery. The
      fluorescence analysis will be performed in the operation room and then specimen will be sent
      to the laboratory for an analysis as usual. Two pieces of prostate will be prelevated
      according to a protocol. The histopathological procedure will be performed without knowledge
      of fluorescence analysis. Except the ICG injection the medical procedure won't be changed.
