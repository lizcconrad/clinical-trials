  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization about 1,400,000 deaths reported annually, are
      related to chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease is very prevalent in South Korea,
      placing a large economic burden nationwide. Subsequently, an effective and systematized
      approach to managing chronic hepatitis is imperative in Korea.

      The natural history of chronic liver disease differs greatly according to race and ethnicity.
      However, there is scarcity of epidemic data on chronic hepatitis based on Korean patients.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to establish a retrospective and prospective multicenter
      cohort for chronic hepatitis B based on Korean patients that may be utilized for various
      future clinical studies on chronic hepatitis B in Korea, and thereby serve as a basis for the
      establishment and distribution of clinical guidelines for Korean patients with chronic
      hepatitis B, as part of a nationwide project supported by the Centers for Disease Control
      (CDC), Korea.

      The investigators plan to collect 500 cases as have been advised by the CDC during the study
      period (September, 2014-March, 2015) from 4 tertiary hospitals located in Korea. In the past
      5 years, there have been about 800 subjects with chronic hepatitis B who have undergone liver
      fibroscan and liver biopsy from these 4 institutions. The investigators plan to register
      available cases retrospectively from those who are available to agree to give written
      informed consent to participate in this study, and to register the remaining numbers of cases
      prospectively, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

    <description>This study aims for the establishment of chronic hepatitis B cohort and has no other primary end point other than the registration of the patient. (For Time-to-Event outcome measures, the development of events including HCC, ascitic decompensation, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, transplantation, and death will be followed up to 10 years after enrollment. Time to the development of each kind of event will be calculated from the date of enrollment and the respective date of event development.)</description>
