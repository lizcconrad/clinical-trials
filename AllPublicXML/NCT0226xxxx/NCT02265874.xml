    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if nicotine treatment is beneficial for the
      treatment of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause that leads to
      inflammation. This disease affects your body's organs.

      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive a nicotine
      patch to use for approximately 7 months; the other group will receive placebo for nicotine
      patches to use for the same time period.

      Both groups will be contacted weekly by phone for the first 3 weeks then monthly for the
      duration of the study to monitor for any side effects.

      The following information and samples will be collected:

      Questionnaires Medical History Spirometry CT Scans Physical Exam Blood Samples for nicotine
      and nicotine metabolites

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and female subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 75 years of age will be screened for
             eligibility.

          -  Eligible adult patients will have histologically proven sarcoidosis, diagnosed at
             least 6 months before screening, evidence of parenchymal disease on chest radiograph,
             an FVC between 50% and 85% of the predicted value, and a Medical Research Council
             dyspnea score (47) of at least grade 1.

          -  Patients must have been treated with at least 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent or
             one or more immunomodulating agents (hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, azathioprine,
             leflunomide) for &gt;3 months before screening.

          -  Doses of these medications must be stable for at least 1 month before study entry.

          -  During the study, background medication regimen and doses are to remain stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  active tobacco smoking or use of smokeless tobacco products containing nicotine,

          -  active cardiac or central nervous system disease,

          -  history of adverse reaction to nicotine or nicotine-containing products,

          -  patients with extensive irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (based upon lung biopsy or
             high resolution CT scan criterion) or inability to provide consent.

        The subject will be excluded if they have a smoking history of greater than 20 pack years,
        or a diagnosis of other significant respiratory disorder other, than sarcoidosis that, in
        the opinion of the investigator, would complicate the evaluation of response to treatment;
        or, history of substance abuse (drugs or alcohol) within 3 years prior to screening or
        other circumstances (e.g., psychiatric disease) that could interfere with the subject's
        adherence to protocol requirements or increase their risk of drug (nicotine) dependence.
