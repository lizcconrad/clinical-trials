  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject or legal representative has been informed of the nature of the evaluation,
             agrees to its provisions, and has signed the informed consent form (ICF).

          2. Subject agrees to comply with the protocol-mandated follow-up procedures and visits.

          3. The subject is ≥ 21 years old.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within seven days prior to index procedure. Female subjects who are
             surgically sterile or post-menopausal are exempt from having a pregnancy test.

          5. The subject has lifestyle-limiting claudication or mild tissue loss defined as:
             Rutherford Category1 2-5 (moderate claudication to minor tissue loss).

          6. The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis or restenosis ≥50% or
             occlusion in the SFA and/or popliteal artery (by visual estimate) and is amenable to
             PTA and stenting.

          7. The target vessel reference diameter is (by visual estimate) appropriate for treatment
             with available stent diameters of 6.0 and 7.0 mm.

          8. There is angiographic evidence of at least one vessel runoff to the foot (at the level
             of the malleolus).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is unable or unwilling to provide informed consent or is unable or
             unwilling to comply with the study follow-up procedure and visits.

          2. The subject has claudication or critical limb ischemia described as Rutherford
             Category 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild claudication), or 6 (major tissue loss).

          3. The subject has a known contraindication (including allergic reaction) or sensitivity
             to antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication, nickel, titanium or tantalum.

          4. The subject has a known sensitivity to contrast media that is not amenable to
             pretreatment with steroids or/and antihistamines.

          5. The subject has a history of bleeding diatheses of coagulopathy.

          6. The subject has concomitant renal failure with a creatinine of &gt;2.5 mg/dL.

          7. The subject has concomitant hepatic insufficiency,thrombophlebitis, uremia, systemic
             lupus erythematosus (SLE), or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the time of the study
             procedure.

          8. The subject is receiving dialysis or immunosuppressive therapy.

          9. The subject is participating in an investigational drug or another investigational
             device study.

         10. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may cause him/her to be noncompliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation, or is associated with limited life expectancy of less than two years.

         11. The subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease, which,in the opinion of the
             investigator, precludes safe insertion of an introducer sheath.

         12. The target lesion is located within an aneurysm or associated with an aneurysm in the
             vessel segment either proximal or distal to the target lesion.

         13. The subject has angiographic evidence of poor inflow, which would be deemed inadequate
             to support a vascular bypass graft.

         14. The subject is diagnosed with septicemia at the time of the study procedure.

         15. Subjects with a stent previously implanted into the target lesion. A target vessel
             with a previously placed stent is permitted as long as the subject device will not
             come into contact with the previously placed stent during treatment of the target
             lesion.

         16. Lesions requiring the use of more than one investigational stent.

         17. Bilateral disease in the native SFA and/or proximal popliteal artery where both limbs
             meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and it is planned to treat both limbs within 30
             days.
