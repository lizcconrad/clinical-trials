  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of EXPAREL in a transversus
      abdominis plane block by assessing the demand of postoperative narcotic, length of hospital
      stay and incidence of postoperative complications.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be evaluate for their post operative pain by nurses using visual analog scale from 0 to 10, zero means no pain, 10 is the worst pain can patient ever experience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative narcotic use</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured, by converting all narcotic medicine used during postoperative period to equal morphine in mg, a calculator created by our pharmacy expert is able to convert any narcotic medicine such as fentanyl, oxycodone, hydromorphone, to morphine in mg. By doing that will have one variable to compare to the two groups.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative complications.</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, and 30 days after discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Any postoperative complications within 30 days of procedure, including death will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Length of hospital stay.</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Length of hospital stay will be measured in number of days patient spends in the hospital from the day of procedure till discharge.</description>
