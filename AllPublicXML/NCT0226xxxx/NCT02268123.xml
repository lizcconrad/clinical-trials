      The purpose of this study is to determine if sperm DNA fragmentation is associated with in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes when euploid embryos are transferred. Euploid embryos are
      those that have a complete set of chromosomes (46, XX or 46, XY). Sperm DNA fragmentation
      refers to sperm DNA that is damaged or has an altered structure. The sperm chromatin
      structure assay (SCSA) is a method to evaluate sperm DNA Fragmentation.

      Couples will undergo a routine IVF cycle at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey.
      Semen specimens collected on the day of ICSI will undergo semen analysis as per routine. An
      aliquot of semen (0.5- 1mL) will be collected for subsequent evaluation of DNA fragmentation
      by the Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA) testing at SCSA Diagnostics. All embryo
      biopsies will undergo CCS analysis in the genomics laboratory, Foundation for Assessment and
      Enhancement of Embryonic Competence.

      An aliquot semen (0.5 - 1mL) will be collected and cryopreserved for analysis for DNA
      Fragmentation. Two tubes of serum (approximately 20 mL) will be collected from male partner
      via venipuncture.
