      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with Merkel
      cell cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or controlled with treatment, or has spread to
      other parts of the body. Pembrolizumab may stimulate the immune system to identify and
      destroy cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) as the first systemic
      intervention for patients with advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of MK-3475 as the first systemic intervention for
      patients with advanced MCC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immune correlates of the clinical activity of MK-3475.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      * NOTE: Patients with confirmed disease progression may continue to receive treatment if they
      are otherwise clinically stable until there is an increase in tumor burden of 25% or more
      following initial confirmation of progression. Under exceptional circumstances, and with
      protocol principal investigator (P.I.) and Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) P.I.
      approval, patients may receive treatment beyond 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, annually until the patient has completed 3
      years of follow up for disease assessment, and then every 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be estimated as the number of responders as a percent of the number of eligible participants who received at least one dose of treatment. If a substantial amount of data is missing, analyses will be performed using parametric generalized linear models fit by maximum likelihood. A generalized linear model for the ORR will use a binomial error distribution. The model will include as covariates all available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes. Responses to continued pembrolizumab will be chronicled and reported.</description>

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, interstitial lung disease, non-infectious pneumonitis,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children
             within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or
             screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment

               -  NOTE: pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be
                  discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475

               -  Men and nonpregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing
                  to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive;
                  highly unlikely to conceive is defined as (1) surgically sterilized, or (2)
                  postmenopausal (a woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for
                  greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or (3) not heterosexually
                  active for the duration of the study; the 2 birth control methods can be barrier
                  method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; subjects
                  should start using birth control from the screening visit throughout the study
                  period up to 120 days after the last dose of study therapy

               -  The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception:
                  diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or
                  spermicide; appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and
                  marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational
                  agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)

               -  Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown
                  risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in
                  order to participate in the study, they must adhere to the contraception
                  requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the
                  follow-up period described above; if there is any question that a subject will
                  not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should
                  not be entered into the study

               -  Pregnancy: if a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with
                  MK-3475, the patient will immediately be removed from the study; the site will
                  contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the
                  pregnancy has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be
                  reported without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse
                  experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or
                  life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study investigator
                  will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the
                  pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient
                  impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed
                  immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed

               -  Subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment

          -  Patient is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

        meet the following eligibility requirements:

          -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy from an
             HIV perspective

          -  They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL

          -  They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection

               -  Patient has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
                  reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA]
                  [qualitative] is detected)

          -  Note: a positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e.,
             hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb]-positive and hepatitis B core antibody
             [HBcAb]-negative) or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B infection is not an exclusion
             criterion

               -  Has active non-infectious pneumonitis &gt;= grade 2; or history of grade 3
                  non-infectious pneumonitis within the past 12 months; or any history of grade 4
