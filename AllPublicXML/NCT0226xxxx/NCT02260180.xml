  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and dose-response of 2 concentrations of
      A-101 versus a vehicle control in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of 2
      concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when applied to SK
      target lesions on the face. A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2
      concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when applied
      topically up to 2 times to SK target lesions on the face.

               -  Have a longest dimension perpendicular to the longest axis that is ≥7mm and ≤15mm
                  (Section 5.4)

               -  Have a thickness that is ≤2mm

               -  Be a discrete lesion

               -  Be, when centered in the area outlined by the provided 3cm diameter circular
                  template, the only seborrheic keratosis lesion present

               -  Not be on the eyelids

               -  Not be within 5mm of the orbital rim

               -  Not be covered with hair which, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere
                  with the study medication application or the study evaluations (NB: the study
                  medication may bleach hair)

               -  Not be in an intertriginous fold

               -  Not be pedunculated.

          5. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she has a negative urine
             pregnancy test and agrees to use an approved effective method of birth control
             (Section 8) for the duration of the study

          6. Subject is non-pregnant and non-lactating

          7. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of the target
             lesion or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation

             study assessments:

               -  LASER, light (e.g., intense pulsed light [IPL], photo-dynamic therapy [PDT]) or

               -  Retinoids; 28 days

               -  Liquid nitrogen, electrodesiccation, curettage, imiquimod, 5-flurouracil, or
