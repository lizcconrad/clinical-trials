  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain (pain that is that is present for a long period of time) is very common among
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Unfortunately, chronic pain is very difficult to treat.
      Many treatments reduce chronic pain only partially. As a result, many people with SCI must
      find ways of accomplishing daily activities even though they have pain.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well two different kinds of education
      programs reduce the extent to which chronic pain interferes with daily life and well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a highly prevalent and disabling condition among persons with spinal cord injury
      (SCI). Unfortunately, current pain treatments offer incomplete relief, produce side effects,
      and/or involve significant cost. Low-risk, low-cost treatments capable of addressing residual
      pain and pain-related disability are greatly needed. A number of research studies have
      associated educational interventions with improvements in pain-related outcomes.

      The overall goal of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and potential benefits of two types of educational programs for people with chronic pain and
      spinal cord injury. This study aims to identify a low-cost, low-risk treatment option that
      empowers people with pain and SCI to improve their functioning and quality of life.

    <description>The extent to which pain interferes with daily activities will be measured with the Life Interference Subscale of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI-LIS). The MPI-LIS is a 10-item self-report of extent of interference of pain with life activities and the enjoyment of life. The subscale will be modified to remove two items related to work, as recommended based on a factor analysis of the subscale in persons with SCI.</description>
