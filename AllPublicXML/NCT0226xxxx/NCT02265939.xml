      Patients who require screening colonoscopy will receive an intraluminal spraying of NPO-13
      per contraction region of large bowel up to fifth times during the colonoscopy.

      The efficacy of NPO-13 will be evaluated based on the proportion of the splayed region with
      no contraction after NPO-13 dosage (primary outcome measure). The colonic spasm will be
      assessed by an independent committee using recorded video images.

      The safety of NPO-13 will be evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) observed between administration and seven days after administration.
