  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of ODM-203 in subjects with advanced solid tumours and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile of ODM-203 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-203 to recommend the dosing
      regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM 203 will be
      evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels
