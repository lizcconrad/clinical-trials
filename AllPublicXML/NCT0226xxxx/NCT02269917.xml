      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy while switching to a
      once-daily single-tablet regimen containing darunavir (DRV)/ cobicistat (COBI)/ emtricitabine
      (FTC)/ tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) (D/C/F/TAF tablet) relative to continuing the current
      regimen consisting of a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) combined with tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (FTC/TDF) in virologically-suppressed (human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      ribonucleic acid [HIV-1 RNA] concentrations less than [&lt;] 50 copies per milliliter
      [copies/mL]) HIV-1 infected participants.

      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), active-controlled
      (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a standard treatment
      or procedure), open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment,
      participants are receiving), multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), study in virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 infected adult
      participants. The study will include a Screening Period of approximately 30 days (up to
      maximum 6 weeks), a controlled Treatment Period of 48 weeks, an Extension Phase of 48 weeks.
      All eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either current treatment
      regimen - a bPI (limited to DRV with low-dose ritonavir [rtv] or COBI, atazanavir [ATV] with
      rtv or COBI, or lopinavir [LPV] with rtv) combined with FTC/TDF, or experimental treatment
      regimen - D/C/F/TAF once-daily single-tablet for 48 weeks. After completion of week 48,
      participants assigned to the experimental treatment will continue with D/C/F/TAF in the
      extension phase up to week 96 . Participants who continued their current regimen will receive
      the experimental treatment (if all criteria are fulfilled) at week 52 up to week 96. As from
      Week 96, all participants will be given the option to continue D/C/F/TAF treatment, if they
      wish and if they continue to benefit from it until D/C/F/TAF becomes commercially available
      and is reimbursed, or can be accessed through another source in the country where he/she is
      living,or until the sponsor terminates clinical development. A bone investigation substudy
      will be performed at selected study sites, to assess bone biomarkers and energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scans, in approximately 300 participants (200 in the D/C/F/TAF treatment
      arm versus 100 in the control arm) who provide informed consent for the substudy.
