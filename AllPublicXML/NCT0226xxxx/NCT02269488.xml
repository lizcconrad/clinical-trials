      This open-label, single arm, multicenter study will enroll approximately 100 subjects. The
      study is designed to gather the safety and tolerability data in Japanese children 2 to 6
      years of age that would support approval of MEDI3250 in Japan.

    <textblock>
      For children age 2 years through 6 years, the recommended dosage schedule for intranasal
      administration is 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children not previously vaccinated against
      seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.

      For the safety and tolerability endpoint, data will be gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs
      and SAEs.

    <description>Solicited symptoms experienced from administration of investigational product through 14 days post vaccination by dose number.
Solicited symptoms are events that are considered likely to occur post dosing. For this study, solicited symptoms include &quot;Fever ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C) by any route&quot;, &quot;Runny/stuffy nose&quot;, &quot;Sore throat&quot;, &quot;Cough&quot;, &quot;Headache&quot;, &quot;Generalized muscle aches&quot;, &quot;Decreased activity level (lethargy) or tiredness/weakness&quot;, &quot;Decreased appetite&quot; and &quot;Collection of specific solicited symptoms (sore throat, headache, generalized muscle aches) will be omitted when, according to the judgment of the investigator, the subject is too young to reliably report a particular symptom&quot;</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Symptoms Experienced From Administration of MEDI3250</title>
        <description>Solicited symptoms experienced from administration of investigational product through 14 days post vaccination by dose number.
Solicited symptoms are events that are considered likely to occur post dosing. For this study, solicited symptoms include &quot;Fever ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C) by any route&quot;, &quot;Runny/stuffy nose&quot;, &quot;Sore throat&quot;, &quot;Cough&quot;, &quot;Headache&quot;, &quot;Generalized muscle aches&quot;, &quot;Decreased activity level (lethargy) or tiredness/weakness&quot;, &quot;Decreased appetite&quot; and &quot;Collection of specific solicited symptoms (sore throat, headache, generalized muscle aches) will be omitted when, according to the judgment of the investigator, the subject is too young to reliably report a particular symptom&quot;</description>
