      In women being treated with medicines to help eggs to grow (called ovulation induction), The
      investigators wish to know whether adding medicines (called ovulation triggers) that help to
      release the egg (ovulation) would lead to more women having babies without causing harm
      compared with not giving them ovulation triggers.

  <detailed_description>

      Women will be treated with clomiphene citrate to help eggs to develop to additionally receive
      a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. the
      investigators tried to determine the benefits and harms of administering an ovulation trigger
      to anovulatory women receiving treatment with ovulation-inducing agents in comparison with
      spontaneous ovulation following ovulation induction. so we will have comparison between 2
      groups, group 1 will receive clomiphene citrate and trigger ovulation by human chorionic
      gonadotrophin and group 2 will receive clomiphene citrate with no drug to trigger ovulation.

    <description>Women will receive clomiphene citrate from day 2 to day 6 of the cycle with a starting dose of 100 mg daily. If no response could be observed, the daily dose of clomiphene citrate in subsequent cycles will be increased by 50 mg until a response will be obtained or a maximum daily dose 200 mg of clomiphene citrate will be used. Once a follicle will reach more than 18 mm in size . Women will receive 5,000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger in the morning between 9 and 10 a.m. and the couple will be advised to have intercourse the following night, about 36 hours later.</description>
