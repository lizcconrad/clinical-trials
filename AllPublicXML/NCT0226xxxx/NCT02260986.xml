  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of Dupilumab administered
      concomitantly with topical corticosteroid (TCS) through Week 16 in adult participants with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) compared to placebo administered concomitantly with
      TCS.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 were reported.</description>

    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-75 responders were the participants who achieved ≥75% overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 16.</description>

    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Participants achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score at Week 16 were reported.</description>

ACQ-5 score was the mean of the 5 questions and range between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) (a higher score indicated lower asthma control). The ACQ-5 questionnaire was administered only to the participants with a medical history of asthma.</description>

The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.</description>

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at worst moment during previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0–10 [0=no itch;10=worst itch imaginable]).</description>

          <description>DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QOL). The 10 questions assessed QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring of 0 (absent disease) to 30 (severe disease); a high score was indicative of a poor QOL.</description>

          <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (severe symptoms) for either anxiety or depression. Cut-offs for identifying psychiatric distress has been reported as 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression.</description>

        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant’s pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 – 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Participants achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score at Week 16 were reported.</description>

        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant’s pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 – 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Participants achieving a reduction of ≥3 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score at Week 52 were reported.</description>

          <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant’s pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 – 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Participants achieving a reduction of ≥4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score at Week 4 were reported.</description>
          <population>All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, which included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization (as randomized). Here, number of participants analyzed = participants with baseline peak pruritus NRS score ≥4.</population>

        <description>HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven items relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire scored from 0 (minimum score) - 3 (maximum score) and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (severe symptoms) for either anxiety or depression. Cut-offs for identifying psychiatric distress has been reported as 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression.</description>

          <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.</description>

Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 (minimum score) - 3 (maximum score) and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (severe symptoms) for either anxiety or depression. Cut-offs for identifying psychiatric distress has been reported as 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression.</description>

          <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received IMP was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to end of treatment at Week 52). Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs. Skin infection TEAEs were identified based on blinded adjudication of all reported TEAEs under the 2 primary System Organ Classes (SOC): SOC = “Infection and Infestations” or SOC = “Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders”. Blinded adjudication was performed and finalized by the study medical monitor before database lock.</description>

          <description>Two subcutaneous injections of Dupilumab 300 mg (for a total of 600 mg) as a loading dose on Day 1, followed by placebo (for Dupilumab) alternating with single 300 mg injection of Dupilumab q2w from Week 1 to Week 51. During weeks in which Dupilumab was not administered, participants received placebo. Four participants received fewer injections of Dupilumab 300 mg in Dupilumab 300 qw arm, were analyzed in Dupilumab 300 mg q2w arm.</description>
