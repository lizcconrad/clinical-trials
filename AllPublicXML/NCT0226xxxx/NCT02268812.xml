  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term, multi-centre multi-national postmarketing observational
      registry. The objective of this study is to monitor the long-term efficacy, safety,
      tolerability and quality of life outcomes associated with Prialt and other analgesics
      utilised in the intrathecal management of severe chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an obsevational non-interventional registry. All patients will sign and date an
      Informed Consent Form (ICF) before enrolment (Baseline Visit). Normal clinical practice will
      be followed. Patients will continue to follow their usual schedule of clinic visits as
      determined by their physician, during which information and patient-completed questionnaires
      will be collected (at scheduled intervals timed to coincide with pump refill). The
      post-baseline assessment schedule is expected to be at 6 weeks, 4 months, and then every 4
      months thereafter.
