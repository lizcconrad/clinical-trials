  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pain treatment can reduce symptoms of
      depression in patients suffering from dementia and depression. Depression is commonly
      diagnosed in patients with dementia. If the investigators find a reduction in depressive
      symptoms when pain treatment is applied, this will support the hypothesis that undiagnosed
      pain may present itself as depression in patients with dementia.

             Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), FAST score &gt; 4

          -  Diagnosed with depression ≥ 4 week duration as measured by CSDD ≥ 8

          -  Written, informed consent provided by the participant (if they have capacity) or
             assent (if they do not have capacity) and a written proxy informed consent from a

          -  Advanced severe medical disease/disorder with expected survival less than 6 months or
             that could interfere with participation

          -  Psychosis or other severe mental disorder prior to dementia diagnosis

          -  Severe aggression (≥8) on item 3 of the NPI subscale, with aggression as the

             psychiatric or neurological disorder.

          -  Patients with diseases that make it impossible to follow the research schedule are
             excluded
