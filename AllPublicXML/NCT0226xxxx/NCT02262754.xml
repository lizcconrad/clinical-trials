    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Low Back Pain Intensity (LBPI) Score as Measured by an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Daily average low back pain was assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants described their average low back pain during the past 24 hours on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicate higher pain. Baseline value was calculated as the mean of the scores over the last 7 days in the placebo run-in period, prior to randomization. Post-baseline weekly scores were calculated based on the mean of the scores over the 7 days prior to and including the day at the end of the corresponding week.</description>

Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Low Back Pain Intensity (LBPI) Score as Measured by an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Daily average low back pain was assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants described their average low back pain during the past 24 hours on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicate higher pain. Baseline value was calculated as the mean of the scores over the last 7 days in the placebo run-in period, prior to randomization. Post-baseline weekly scores were calculated based on the mean of the scores over the 7 days prior to and including the day at the end of the corresponding week.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment [C-CASA]) is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced following: completed suicide =1, suicide attempt =2 (response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior =3 (“Yes” on “preparatory acts or behavior”), suicidal ideation =4 (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), any suicidal behavior or ideation, self-injurious behavior =7 (“Yes” on “Has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior”).</description>

        <description>Average back pain was assessed with an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Participants described their average low back pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10. Percentage of reduction from baseline in the daily average LBPI NRS score was calculated as: ([daily value - baseline value] divided by baseline value) multiplied by 100. Number of participants with sustained response rates (for a minimum of 4 consecutive days) in the daily average LBPI NRS scores that were at &gt;=30 percent and &gt;=50 percent reduced from baseline were reported.</description>
