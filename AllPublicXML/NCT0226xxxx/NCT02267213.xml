             than sorafenib for the treatment of HCC.

          -  Subjects who have received sorafenib within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of the
             treatment dose, or have any sorafenib-related toxicities not yet resolved to grade 1
             or baseline.

          -  Subjects who have undergone liver transplantation surgery.
