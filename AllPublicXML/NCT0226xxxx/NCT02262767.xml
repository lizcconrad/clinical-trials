  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that PF-06649751 with continuous co-administration of
      trimethobenzamide hydrochloride (TMB) with will be safe and well tolerated. Single doses of
      PF-06649751 will be tested in this study, starting at a low dose and escalating to a dose
      projected to be under the current limits for drug concentration.

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - 5</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - 5</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

The subjects will be given concomitant trimethobenzamide hydrochloride for the 3 weeks that the subject is in the CRU. For each of the three periods, subjects will be crossed-over from placebo or PF-06649751. Each PF-06649751 dose is separated by one week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects of non childbearing potential between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
