  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has been recognized as the third most common
      cause of hospital acquired AKI, after hypotension-associated hypo-perfusion and
      post-operative AKI. The development of CI-AKI after cardiac catheterization is associated
      with a significant increase in both short-term and long-term mortality and morbidities, as
      well as an increase in length of stay and cost.

      The only marker of renal function that has predictive ability is creatinine and it has
      significant limitations in identifying patients who will develop AKI. Therefore, a diagnostic
      test for predicting CI-AKI risk would have widespread clinical utility.

      The primary purpose of this study is to measure the association between baseline expression
      of senescence markers in blood using SenesceTest and the occurrence of CI-AKI post cardiac
      catheterization.
