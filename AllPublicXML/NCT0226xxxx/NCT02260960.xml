  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that oral omega-3-acid triglyceride form will decrease dry-eye
      related symptoms as well as clinical markers associated with dry eye disease (TearOsmolarity,
      Schirmer-1 test values, corneal staining, and fluorescein tear break-up time) when compared
      to administration of placebo.
