  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to collect pilot data to explore whether bilateral deep brain stimulation
      (DBS) of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) has beneficial effects on memory and thinking
      impairments among individuals with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of human NBM DBS at improving
      cognitive deficits in DLB patients. Six patients with DLB with moderate cognitive impairments
      (including but not restricted to deficits in attention and working memory) will have
      bilateral DBS electrodes implanted to ensure that superficial contacts lie in the motor
      Globus Pallidum interna (GPi) target, while the deepest electrical contacts lie in the NBM.
      We will place electrodes using our conventional image-guided, stereotactic frame-based
      procedure. Once the surgical wounds have healed, patients will be randomised into 2 groups in
      a crossover trial design to have 6 week periods of NBM stimulation switched on or switched
      off separated by a 2 week washout period, following which the patient will cross over to have
      the opposite condition for a further 6 weeks. Outcome measures collected at the 6 weeks and
      14 weeks timepoints will be compared according to whether each patient was ON or OFF
      stimulation at that timepoint.

      At the end of the crossover period, all patients will be invited for continued follow up with
      stimulation switched on and will have neuropsychological evaluations at 6 monthly intervals.
      Patients will be given the option of receiving additional conventional stimulation to the
      motor GPi, through the higher contacts of each electrode, at the end of the crossover period
      if required for any coexisting Parkinsonian motor complications of DLB.
