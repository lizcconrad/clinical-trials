  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that is the common end of several cardiac diseases with
      symptoms such as muscle fatigue, dyspnea and reduction of quality of life. To improve
      respiratory and general functional capacity of these patients, there are strategies that can
      be used such as inspiratory muscle training and peripheral muscle training (dynamic
      resistance training).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After agreement with the written informed consent, 35 subjects with severe heart failure were
      included in this study. They were randomized in three groups: controls, low-intensity and
      moderate-intensity group. All volunteers were assessed at Baseline and 8-weeks intervention.
      Cardiac events were registered following two years from baseline. The present study aimed to
      assess the effects of a combined program of inspiratory and peripheral muscle training on
      respiratory and general functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic
      heart failure.
