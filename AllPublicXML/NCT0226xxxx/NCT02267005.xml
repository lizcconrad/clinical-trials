  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will bring together a multidisciplinary team of pediatric rheumatologists,
      neurologists, metabolic geneticists and exercise physiologists to determine the effect of
      creatine (CR) supplementation on muscle function and muscle metabolism in children with
      Dermatomyositis (DM). The investigators propose using well-established exercise testing
      techniques as well as new, powerful exercise imaging protocols in order to better delineate
      the effects of CR on muscle pathophysiology in a non-invasive way. Evidence from this study
      will provide information regarding the effect of creatine supplementation on muscle function
      in DM. Improvements in muscle function and fatigue through CR use may also contribute to an
      improvement in quality of life and have significant clinical implications for the treatment
      of children with DM.
