      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK-the study of the way a drug
      enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) characteristics of bortezomib when
      administered intravenously in Taiwanese participants with multiple myeloma (cancer of the
      types of cells normally found in bone marrow).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, single-arm, open-label (all knew the intervention of study), and
      multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to explore the pharmacokinetics with relapsed (the return of a medical problem)
      or refractory (not responding to treatment) multiple myeloma. The study consists of a
      Screening phase and a bortezomib treatment phase with defined PK sample collection time
      points. Participants will receive bortezomib intravenous injection two times a week up to 2
      weeks (on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) and followed by a 10-day resting phase (Days 12 to 21) for 1
      treatment cycle. Pharmacokinetics will primarily be evaluated. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

             or experimental therapy, corticosteroid use above 10 mg/day (prednisone or
             equivalent), or plasmapheresis

          -  Any of the following within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in the study: radiation
             therapy, major surgery (kyphoplasty is not considered major surgery)
