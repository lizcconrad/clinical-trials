  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of a reservoir nasal cannula (Oxymizer®) compared to
      a conventional nasal cannula (CNC) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited during a 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. They
      will perform the following three interventions on consecutive days and will repeat them after
      a week. During these days the time table for prescribed physical activities and therapies
      will be kept in a comparable fashion.

      The following 3 interventions will be performed in randomized order:

      Day A: The Patient wears a conventional nasal cannula for 12 h with oxygen flow rate as
      prescribed during ADL

      Day B: The Patient wears the Oxymizer® with prescribed oxygen flow rate for 12 h during ADL

      Day C: The patient wears the Oxymizer® with a flow rate reduced by 1l/min in comparison to
      the prescribed oxygen flow rate, for 12h

      The following week the same measurements will be repeated. The mean of the corresponding two
      measures will be calculated for each approach.

    <measure>Difference in oxygen saturation between Oxymizer and conventional nasal cannula</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1 to 13</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen Saturation will be measured via pulseoxymetry for 12 hours. On 2 days, mean oxygen Saturation will be reported while using Oxymizer or a conventional nasal cannula, both with similar Oxygen flow. The difference of the mean Oxygen Saturation of 12 hours between both cannulae will be the Primary outcome.</description>

    <description>From 7am to 7pm oxygen saturation is measured by a pulse oximeter. One day with conventional nasal cannula, one day with Oxymizer®, one day with Oxymizer® and reduced Oxygen flow (-1l/min). The order of these days is randomized in 6 groups.
The intervention will be performed on consecutive days and twice during study period.</description>
