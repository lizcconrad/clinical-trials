      To Study the Effect of Polymorphisms in Fas Ligand Gene Promoter Region (rs 763110) and Fas
      gene (rs1800682) on Platinum-Based regimens used in treatment of malignant pleural
      mesothelioma (MPM)

    <textblock>
      This study tries to find a correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) found in
      promoter region of Fas Ligand gene (rs 763110) and Fas (rs1800682) and clinical outcome on
      patients with MPM treated with platinum-Based agents as first line. the patients will have
      one of three following genotypes : Thymine/Thymine, Thymine/Cytosine or Cytosine/Cytosine
      (for Fas ligand polymorphism) and Adenine/Adenine, Adenine/Guanine or Guanine/Guanine ( for
      Fas polymorphism).

    <time_frame>After 6 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days )</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response will be evaluated after the third (initial evaluation response) and the sixth (confirmation of initial response) chemotherapy cycle according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Patients will be assigned to one of following groups: complete response (CR), Partial response (PR), Stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD).</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from day 1 of chemotherapy to the day of documented disease progression or to death from any cause</description>

    <measure>estimation of treatment related toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>during the chemotherapy period, average duration 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hematologic (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) and non hematologic (nausea/vomiting, alopecia and nephrotoxicity) toxicities will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria. The worst degree of toxicity experienced throughout the treatment is used for the analysis. Toxicities of grade 2 or higher will be considered as clinically relevant.</description>
