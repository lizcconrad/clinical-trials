    <measure>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the ACR20 response rate at Week 24.
An ACR20 response meant that the patient achieved a 20% improvement in Tender Joint Count and Swollen Joint Count and in at least 3 of the other 5 Core Data Set elements listed below.
Acute phase reactant (CRP)
Patient global assessment of disease activity
Physician global assessment of disease activity

    <measure>Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) Based on C-reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP assessment involved evaluating the number of tender (TJC) and swollen (SJC) joints (out of 28 specified joints), serum CRP, and patient global assessment of disease activity (VAS from 0 to 100, very well to extremely bad). The DAS28-CRP is a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activity of the patient's RA. A higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swollen Joint Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of swollen joints from amongst 66 selected joints performed by a trained and qualified joint assessor using standardised techniques recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Joints were classified as swollen/not swollen giving a total possible swollen joint count score of 0 to 66 with higher scores indicating severe disease. Swollen joint count is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>

    <measure>Tender Joint Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of tender joints from amongst 68 selected joints were performed by a trained and qualified joint assessor using standardised techniques recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Joints were classified as tender/not tender giving a total possible tender joint count score of 0 to 68 with higher scores indicating severe disease.Tender joint count is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of Serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentrations for inclusion in the ACR20/50/70 and DAS28-CRP scores was performed by a central laboratory. Elevation of CRP is a nonspecific marker of inflammation. Values above 10 mg/L were considered to be abnormally high. Decrease in level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Assessment of Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Patient assessment of disease activity visual analogue scale (VAS) will be assessed on 100-point scales (ranging from very well (0) to extremely bad (100)).The patient assessment of disease activity VAS will contribute to the calculation of the DAS28 score. The patient assessment of disease activity VAS will contribute to the calculation of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response.</description>

    <measure>Physician Assessment of Disease Activity</measure>

    <description>Physician assessment of disease activity visual analogue scale (VAS) will be assessed on 100-point scale (ranging from very low (0) to very high (100)). The physician assessment of disease activity VAS will contribute to the calculation of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Assessment of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An injection site pain visual analogue score (VAS) will be administered to the patient. To determine the extent of the pain, patients will be asked to place a small vertical mark on a horizontal scale from 0 to 100, the ends of which are labelled with the extreme responses to be measured (&quot;No pain&quot; at 0 and &quot;Intolerable pain&quot; at 100). Patient's assessment of pain is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question, self-administered instrument that measures the patient's functional ability on a 4-level difficulty scale (0 to 3, with 0 representing normal or no difficulty and 3 representing inability to perform). Eight categories of functioning are included: dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. This scale is sensitive to change and is a good predictor of future disability. HAQ-DI is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>

    <measure>DAS28-CRP Score Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a combined index that has been developed to measure the disease activity in patients with RA and has been extensively validated for its use in clinical studies. The DAS28-CRP assessment involved evaluating the number of tender (TJC) and swollen (SJC) joints (out of 28 specified joints), serum CRP, and patient global assessment of disease activity (VAS from 0 to 100, very well to extremely bad). The individual results are summed using a formula. The DAS28 is a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activity of the patient's RA. A higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

            <groups_desc>The secondary hypothesis involved equivalence of the difference between FKB327 and Humira in DAS28-CRP at Week 24. Based on the repeated measures analysis model, the difference and its 95% CI in the least-squares means (LSMs) for DAS28-CRP at Week 24 between FKB327 and Humira were estimated. If the 95% CI fell entirely between the pre-specified margin (+/- 0.6), then FKB327 was considered equivalent to Humira.</groups_desc>

        <description>Counts of swollen joints from amongst 66 selected joints performed by a trained and qualified joint assessor using standardised techniques recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Joints were classified as swollen/not swollen giving a total possible swollen joint count score of 0 to 66 with higher scores indicating severe disease. Swollen joint count is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>

          <description>Counts of swollen joints from amongst 66 selected joints performed by a trained and qualified joint assessor using standardised techniques recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Joints were classified as swollen/not swollen giving a total possible swollen joint count score of 0 to 66 with higher scores indicating severe disease. Swollen joint count is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>

        <title>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question, self-administered instrument that measures the patient's functional ability on a 4-level difficulty scale (0 to 3, with 0 representing normal or no difficulty and 3 representing inability to perform). Eight categories of functioning are included: dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. This scale is sensitive to change and is a good predictor of future disability. HAQ-DI is a value of the individual ACR core set variables.</description>

        <title>DAS28-CRP Score Over Time</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a combined index that has been developed to measure the disease activity in patients with RA and has been extensively validated for its use in clinical studies. The DAS28-CRP assessment involved evaluating the number of tender (TJC) and swollen (SJC) joints (out of 28 specified joints), serum CRP, and patient global assessment of disease activity (VAS from 0 to 100, very well to extremely bad). The individual results are summed using a formula. The DAS28 is a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activity of the patient's RA. A higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>
