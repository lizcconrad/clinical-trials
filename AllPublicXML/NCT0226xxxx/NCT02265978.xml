      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a mental health mobile app (CopeSmart) in promoting
      positive mental health through emotional self-awareness in adolescents. Participants will be
      recruited from second-level schools in Ireland. Schools will be randomly assigned to the
      intervention or control condition. Participants in the intervention condition will use
      CopeSmart for a four week period. Those in the control condition will not use any mental
      health app.
