  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to pilot an adolescent obesity intervention, TEENS+, to examine the
      feasibility of this dietary intervention strategy and preliminary effectiveness of two models
      of parental involvement within adolescent obesity treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit overweight or obese adolescents (BMI &gt;85th percentile) and
      parent(s) (BMI &gt;25 kg/m2). Families will participate in one of two 6-month treatments: 1)
      TEENS+Parents as Coaches (PAC), engaging parents as helpers in their child's weight
      management, or 2) TEENS+Parent Weight Loss (PWL), engaging parents in their own weight
      management. All adolescents will participate in TEENS+, which includes behavioral support,
      nutrition education, and supervised physical activity.

      For the adolescents, intervention will consist of weekly 1 hour exercise sessions and
      alternating weekly 1 hour behavioral and nutrition group sessions. Parents will also attend
      the nutrition sessions and participate in a behavioral parent-only biweekly group. Parent
      behavioral group sessions will be specific to the treatment arm (e.g. PAC or PWL).
      Assessments will consist of anthropometric measures, lab work, psychological surveys, and
      nutritional evaluations. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months
      (post-intervention), and 9 months.

    <description>PAC (modeled after NIH-funded NOURISH) focuses on parenting strategies to support and facilitate their child's weight management via family-based change. Each visit includes group psychoeducation and discussion, focused on parenting strategies to facilitate healthy weight management in their child(ren). Topics include focus such as role modeling, strategies for healthy lifestyle changes, and how to be a coach to your teen.</description>

    <description>In PWL parents will be given a weight loss goal of 1-2 lbs/week, as well as specific calorie and fat prescriptions, PA goals, and instructions to self-monitor key information. Parents will receive training in core behavioral weight loss strategies (e.g., goal setting, stimulus control) and techniques to help them achieve these goals and will also receive personalized feedback throughout the program.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Overweight (BMI ≥85% percentile for age and gender according to the CDC
        Growth Charts) males and females between the age of 12 and 17 years will be eligible for
        study participation. In order to be eligible, the adolescent must also reside with the
        primary participating parent, who has a BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 and is also willing to participate
        in the study protocol. Eligible families must live within a 30 mile radius of the Healthy

        In addition, adolescents will be excluded from participation (and referred for further
        evaluation) based on the results of baseline psychological assessments under the following
        circumstances: 1) clinically significant depression, evidenced by elevations (&gt;20) on CDI;
        2) suicidality as reported on CDI or during screening / behavioral interview; 3) psychosis,
