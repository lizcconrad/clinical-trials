      The main objective of our study is to determine the diagnostic performance of an
      ultra-portable ultrasound (V-Scan®) device for emergency compression ultrasound when used by
      experienced ermergency doctors searching for proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients
      with no history of DVT. The gold standard is Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs performed
      by a vascular exploration expert.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography performed
           with and ultra-portable device (V-Scan®) with that of emergency compression
           ultrasonography performed with a classic device

        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography between
           patients suspected of having DVT arriving through the emergency department versus
           similar patients sent in by their generalist

        -  to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography among
           patients with suspected DVT according to pre clinical probability testing based on the
           Wells score (low, medium or high probability).

      Currently, the use of ultra-portable ultrasound in this indication is not part of routine
      care, and this study is therefore considered interventional in nature.
