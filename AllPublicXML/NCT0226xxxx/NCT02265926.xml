  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to find out if usage of N95 type respirators affects respiratory parameters in
      pregnant women so as to provide guidance on N95 respirator usage in pregnant healthcare
      workers.

      The first phase of the study aims to determine the average workload of a nurse. In the second
      phase of the study, this workload is then translated to walking on a treadmill while pregnant
      subjects wore special masks open to air, then occluded with N95 mask materials.

    <description>Participants wore a tight fitting mask (Hans Rudolph) that was attached to the metabolic cart through an air sampling tube. Inspired ambient air and expired air were channeled through a pneumotachometer that was attached to the front of the mask which calculated air volume by the rate of rotation of a rotor turbine located within it. The turbine had zero resistance to air flow and the rate of rotation of the turbine, sensed by infrared light within the pneumotachometer, corresponds directly to inspired and expired air volume for each breath. Multiple air samples from each expired-breath was drawn into the metabolic carts through a sampling line for the measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide content by the respective gas sensors within the metabolic carts.</description>
