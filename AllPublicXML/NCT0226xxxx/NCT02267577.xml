  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team has developed an automatic blood pressure monitor to be used for the
      monitoring and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, particularly in low-resource
      settings where current monitoring is limited.

      90 adult volunteers will be enrolled by researchers at Rice University. The participant will
      be seated in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level. Arm circumference will be measured
      and a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the arm. The cuff will be inflated and blood
      pressure measurements will be taken by a commercially available device and by test monitor.
      Blood pressure measurements from both devices will be recorded. The participant's blood
      pressure will be measured up to 9 times with a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between each
      measurement.

      The results of this study will be used to optimize the blood pressure detection algorithm and
      thus further develop the device.
