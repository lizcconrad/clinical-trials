      Background: The prevalence of both senile cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and aortic stenosis (AS)
      markedly increases with age. Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular pressure overload.
      Cardiac deposits have been observed in AS and the amount of these deposits has been
      correlated to post-surgical outcome. As they are strong echocardiographic and cardiac MRI
      imaging similarities between CA and AS, the investigators hypothesized that the deposit
      observed in AS is transthyretin amyloid deposit. The investigators objective is to
      demonstrate that amyloid deposit is associated with poor outcomes following aortic stenosis
      surgical valve replacement.

      Materiel and methods: 180 patients with indication for surgical aortic valve replacement will
      be recruited prospectively and consecutively in 5 French centers. A replicative study will be
      performed in one Austrian center. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy will be
      performed prior to surgery. During surgery, a basal LV septum biopsy will be collected for
      determination and quantification of interstitial deposits using specific staining which will
      be performed in a blind fashion. Clinical outcomes will be recorded during the
      hospitalization period following the surgery and at 1 year. Alive and re-hospitalization
      status will be determined. Patients will be classified according to the presence or not of
      amyloid deposits.

      Expected results and impact: This study will emphasize how pressure overload stress
      accelerates and magnifies amyloid deposition usually known to be related to cardiac aging
      process. It will develop reliable imaging tools and markers to detect cardiac amyloid
      deposition. Correlation between anatomopathologic analyses and the three different imaging
      technics will identify accurate imaging markers of CA. A risk stratification model based on
      amyloid deposits level for the clinical management of these patients will be created
      combining imaging and biological markers.

      Cardiovascular diseases remain the major cause of mortality and morbidity in industrialised
      countries. Their prevalence increases steeply as consequence of the aging of the population
      in these countries. Curiously, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases share common
      aging pathological pathways involving abnormal accumulation of insoluble amyloid proteins in
      the extracellular matrix disrupting normal organ function. Whereas neurological amyloid
      diseases has been considerably investigated, little attention has been paid to the
      aggregation of amyloid proteins in cardiovascular diseases. Post-mortem studies have
      identified cardiac wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis deposition in 25% of individuals over
      the age of 80 years leading to the concept of &quot;senile cardiac amyloidosis&quot; (CA) (Cornwell, Am
      j Med 1984; Pitkanen, Am J Pathol 1984). The cause of this deposition is not yet known but
      might be related primarily to aging process and enhanced by cardiac mechanical stress
      (overload), hypoxia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Since patients with transthyretin CA
      develop severe heart failure with poor prognosis, it is crucial to identify them especially
      among population at risk such those with aortic stenosis (AS). Indeed this common valvular
      heart disease affects mainly senescent subjects and combines so the adverse effects on
      myocardial function of both pressure overload and myocardial aging.

      Interestingly, some elderly patients with severe AS exhibit similar echocardiographic and
      cardiac MRI patterns as those reported in CA including increased cardiac wall thickness and
      progressive left ventricular dysfunction starting with alteration of basal LV-2D strain. They
      also exhibit increased late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at cardiac MRI. This has been
      interpreted as related to interstitial myocardial &quot;fibrosis&quot; and has been correlated with
      poor prognosis after aortic valve replacement i.e.; high mortality, persistence of heart
      failure symptoms and LV dysfunction (Weidemann Circ 2009; Dweck, JACC 2011; Hermann JACC
      2011). However none of these patients have benefited from a detailed histology analysis with
      aiming at identifying amyloid deposits. The investigators have recently found similar
      clinical observations in the investigators AS cohort. Using specific staining, the
      investigators were able to unmask the association of severe AS and CA in these patients.
      These preliminary findings raise the question of a potential pathophysiological link between
      CA and AS and might explain why some patients with AS may not benefit from cardiac surgery.
