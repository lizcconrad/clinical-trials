  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, prospective, single-group longitudinal study. The purpose of this
      study is to improve the decision making process used by physicians and patients when they are
      considering stopping their Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, prospective, single-group longitudinal study. The overall objective
      is to improve decision making for TKI discontinuation in eligible CML patients. Patients with
      CML on treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and are in confirmed deep
      molecular response will stop their TKI. Confirmed deep molecular response is defined as
      BCR-ABL &lt; 0.01%, (&gt; MR4 i.e. &gt; 4 log reduction) for at least 2 years. The study will closely
      monitor patients using standard RQ-PCR testing for molecular recurrence, testing them monthly
      for 6 months, then every other month until 24 months, and then quarterly until 36 months.
      Concurrently, the study will assess a wide range of PROs before stopping TKIs and after
      discontinuation in conjunction with PCR testing, though at fewer time points, utilizing
      online and/or phone questionnaires. Patients who have molecular CML recurrence based on
      RQ-PCR will restart imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and will continue to be
      monitored for disease status and health status until the end of the study.
