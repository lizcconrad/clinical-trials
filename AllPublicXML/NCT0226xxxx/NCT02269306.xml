  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Visceral fat area and other criteria
      assessed during initial screening could predict the response to ovulation induction with
      clomiphene citrate (CC) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

    <textblock>
      The study was carried out on 150 patients with PCOS. Initial CC doses were 50 mg daily for 5
      days starting on cycle day 3. In the case of an absent response, doses were increased to 100
      and 150 mg daily in subsequent cycles. First ovulation with CC was used as the end
      point.Statistical methods Distribution of characteristics in patients is presented as the
      mean Â± SD. We used the Mann-Whitney U test for exploratory comparison of initial parameters
      between responders and nonresponders. The univariate and multivariate relation with response
      to CC was assessed using logistic regression analysis. Backward stepwise elimination was used
      for the multivariate logistic analysis of prediction of patients being CRA, and P &lt; 0.10 was
      used as a cut-off level for elimination of non-significant predictors from the prognostic
      model. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to
      assess the discriminative ability of the logistic models. SPSS with statistical package
      version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and MedCalc Software version 12.4, (Ostend, Belgium) were
      employed for data analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study included 150 infertile women(age from 18 to 40 years) with PCOS diagnosed by
             the presence of at least two of the following [15]:

               1. Clinical hyperandrogenism: Hirsutism or acne vulgaris and/or biochemical
                  hyperandrogenism (total testosterone &gt;88 ng/dl or DHEAS &gt;275 ug/dL)[16]. (2)
                  Menstrual and/or ovulatory disturbances, mainly oligomenorrhea (interval between
                  vaginal bleeding &gt;35 days and &lt; 6 months) or amenorrhea (bleeding interval &gt;6
                  months). (3) Polycystic ovaries as visualized by transvaginal ultrasound (either
                  12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm in diameter or increased ovarian volume &gt;10
                  cm3).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having one or more of these criteria were excluded; Age &lt;18 years or &gt;40
             years, body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 kg/m2 or &gt;35 kg/m2, pregnancy, endocrine disorders,
             systemic disease, current or previous (within the last 3 months) use of oral
             contraceptives, glucocorticoids, antiandrogens, ovulation induction or dopaminergic
             agents, use of antidiabetes, antiobesity drugs or history of tubal or ovarian surgery.
