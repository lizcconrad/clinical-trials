      The study will monitor outcomes of two interventions to develop a best practice in the
      treatment of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot randomized controlled clinical trial (RCCT) will provide preliminary data
      to examine the effect of a novel intervention to promote brain health after mild Traumatic
      Brain Injury (mTBI). The study will implement a randomized controlled clinical trial of a 6
      week exercise intervention (STEP) for participants with persistent mTBI symptoms, comparing
      STEP to standard of care practice in the controls. We will demonstrate the feasibility and
      acceptability of the STEP intervention. We hypothesize that STEP will lead to meaningful
      improvement on objective measures of self-reported mTBI symptoms, formal neuropsychological
      performance, and postural stability.
