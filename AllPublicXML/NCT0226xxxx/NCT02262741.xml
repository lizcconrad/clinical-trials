    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-exploration and dose-expansion study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of
      MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck.
