  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on warfarin but with unstable international normalized ratio (INR) will be recruited
      to a randomized trial comparing dosing based on an algorithm (Fearon algorithm, named after
      the mathematician Michael Fearon), which uses historical data to estimate patients'
      sensitivity to warfarin and to dose changes as well as the lag time until a dose adjustment
      takes effect, or to the investigators standard management Main outcome is improvement in time
      in therapeutic range.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with very variable INRs resulting in a low proportion of time in therapeutic range
      (TTR) have a higher risk of both bleeding complications and thromboembolic events. A good TTR
      is generally considered to be over 60% and &quot;excellent TTR&quot; is above 72% of time in range. The
      investigators will recruit patients with a TTR below 50%.

      The Fearon algorithm provides a more thorough understanding of the individual responses to
      changes in warfarin dose and with a personalized nomogram for dose adjustments and timing of
      laboratory tests the investigators have an opportunity to improve the TTR and on a larger
      scale to reduce clinically important adverse events. Before embarking on a large randomized
      trial with this revised Fearon algorithm-derived nomogram this pilot study with a randomized,
      open-label design will be performed to demonstrate proof of principle.

    <description>All available historical data will be used to calculate with the Fearon algorithm the individual sensitivity to warfarin and to dose changes as well as lag time until a dose adjustment reaches full effect. Based on this a personal dosing nomogram will be developed and provided to the investigator and to the patients. This nomogram will be used during 6 month but override is possible if the investigator feels that the suggestion from the nomogram is unsafe.</description>
