    <textblock>
      Pulmonary atelectasis is a frequent respiratory postoperative complication in cardiac
      surgery. Classically, the treatment of these patients is based on manual chest physiotherapy.
      Our objective is to evaluate the interest of association of positive end expiratory delivery
      sessions with the EzPAP® device. We perform a prospective monocentric, open label trial.
      Patients with atelectasis after scheduled cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass are
      included. They benefit from manual chest therapy and are randomised to receive or not
      positive end expiratory pressure sessions twice a day. The primary endpoint is the effect of
      this treatment on atelectasis radiological score after 2 days of treatment. The secondary
      endpoints are: oxygen saturation(SpO2)/inspired oxygen(FiO2) ratio, qualitative evaluation of
      ventilatory function, respiratory &amp; cardiac rate, pain, inspiratory pressure (sniff test),
      patient satisfaction, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay.
