  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocturia, or voiding at night, is an extremely troublesome symptom which is highly prevalent
      in the elderly. Desmopressin is a treatment for nocturia but it can result in hyponatremia
      (low blood sodium), particularly in those aged 65 and older. Fesoterodine is used for the
      treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Recent trials showed Fesoterodine was effective in
      reducing nocturia. This study aims to answer the following: In women 65 and older with severe
      nocturia, is Fesoterodine more effective than Desmopressin in reducing the number of night
      time voids? Does Fesoterodine have a better side effect profile compared to Desmopressin?

      The study design is a 12 week randomized double-blinded trial of Fesoterodine and
      Desmopressin in the treatment of severe nocturia in women aged 65 and older. This will be
      conducted at the Urogynecology Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and Baycrest. A 3 day
      voiding diary and Nocturia, Nocturnal Enuresis and Sleep-interruption Questionnaire (NNES-Q)
      will be completed at baseline and at week 12. The primary outcome will be the number of night
      time voids in the Fesoterodine group compared to the Desmopressin group, 12 weeks after
      starting treatment. Secondary outcomes include changes in the NNES-Q scores and the safety of
      each medication.

      This study is expected to show that, in women 65 and older with severe nocturia, Fesoterodine
      will be more effective in reducing the number of night time voids, reducing the volume of
      voided urine, increasing the duration of sleep prior to first nocturnal void and improving
      quality of life relative to Desmopressin. Fesoterodine will also be better tolerated, with
      fewer significant adverse events, relative to Desmopressin.

      This study will include female patients 65 years and older from the Urogynecology Units at
      Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and Baycrest. It will be a 12 week prospective, randomized
      double-blind trial comparing treatment of nocturia using Fesoterodine and Desmopressin.
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will receive a starting dose of either
      Fesoterodine 4mg tablet at bedtime or Desmopressin 0.1mg tablet at bedtime. After 4 weeks, if
      patients have had minimal improvement in their symptoms and are not significantly affected by
      side effects, patients will have the option of increasing the dose of their medication to 8mg
      of Fesoterodine or 0.2mg of Desmopressin. This decision will be made by the patient and
      physician together.

      Patients will undergo block randomization by pharmacy. All patients and investigators will be
      blinded to the treatment group. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks, with visits at 4 and
      12 weeks. Patients will also have urine cultures and uroflowmetry with measurement of
      post-void residuals at these visits, as per clinic standard of care. Venipuncture to monitor
      electrolyte levels will be done at baseline, 1 week after randomization and then monthly
      until the end of the study. If patients choose to increase their dose at the 4 week visit,
      electrolyte levels will be repeated one week after the dose adjustment and then monthly until
      the end of the study. The last follow up is at 12 weeks, when a 3 day voiding diary and the
      NNES-Q will be collected.
