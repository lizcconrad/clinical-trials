  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate how cerebellar resection surgery may affect pain
      sensation and the way the brain &quot;reads&quot; pain signals. By measuring brain activity in children
      and adolescents following surgery, the investigators hope to gain valuable information about
      pain processing in the brain.

      This study is designed to test whether cerebellar resection surgery affects pain pathways in
      the brain. To participate a participant must (A) have had a cerebellar mass surgically
      removed, or (B) are a healthy volunteer with no history of pain disorders or mental illness.
      The study will involve sensory testing and brain imaging using magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) Sensory testing will be performed using a tub of cold water, as well as a contact
      thermode capable of delivering hot and cold temperatures. MRI brain scanning uses magnetic
      fields and radio waves to give pictures of the brain without using radiation.
