      a multicenter, open-label phase Ib study to determine the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of Sulfatinib 300 mg once a day in treating advanced neuroendocrine
      tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is patients with low- or intermediate-grade (G1 or G2) advanced NET who
      have failed in standard treatment or are unable to receive standard treatment.Sulfatinib 300
      mg once a day (QD) will be orally administrated on a 28-day cycle. Investigators will
      evaluate the clinical tumor response to Sulfatinib, and if investigators determine that the
      patient can benefit from the continuation of treatment, the patient will continue the
      Sulfatinib treatment. The duration of study will be 2 years. At the time of study completion,
      if investigators believe patients can continue to benefit from the investigational product,
      patients may be provided with Sulfatinib with the agreement of the sponsor.

             [HPF] and a Ki67 index of ≤ 20%; or (b) be NETs of the lung or thymus (carcinoid) with
             a mitotic count of ≤ 10/10 High Power Field [HPF])

          4. Have measurable lesions (according to RECIST 1.1);
