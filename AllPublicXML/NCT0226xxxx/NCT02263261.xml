      This is a prospective, single-site pilot study in which outcomes associated with the use of
      Flex HD® Pliable™ Perforated, Human Acellular Dermal Matrix and an implant which are used in
      post-mastectomy breast reconstruction will be obtained. The data collected will include
      reconstructive outcomes, aesthetic outcomes and patient-reported outcomes in order to
      ascertain advantages and disadvantages of using this particular HADM in post-mastectomy
      breast reconstruction.
