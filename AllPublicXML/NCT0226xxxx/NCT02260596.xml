    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort of solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) recipients will be assembled to determine the incidence of respiratory viral
      infections diagnosed during an inpatient admission in the first year post-transplant. A
      sub-cohort of patients that develop a respiratory viral infection within one year of
      transplantation will be leveraged to investigate factors associated with mortality in the
      three months after respiratory viral infection.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the study is to 1) Determine the incidence of respiratory viral infections
      diagnosed during the first year post SOT and HSCT; 2a) Determine the all-cause mortality
      within 3 months of a respiratory viral infection diagnosed during an inpatient admission in
      the first year post SOT and HSCT; 2b) Determine the proportion of deaths within 3 months of a
      respiratory viral infection diagnosed during an inpatient admission deemed to be directly
      attributable to that infection; and 3) To identify factors known at time of onset of the
      inpatient respiratory viral infection that are associated with all-cause mortality. The study
      cohort will consist of any SOT or HSCT recipient ≤18 years of age that received their
      transplant between January 1st, 2010 and June 30th, 2013. Th cohort will determine the
      incidence of respiratory viral infections diagnosed during an inpatient admission in the
      first year post-transplant. A sub-cohort of patients that develop a respiratory viral
      infection within one year of transplantation will be leveraged to investigate factors
      associated with mortality in the 3 months after respiratory viral infection. Baseline and
      demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive summaries. Categorical
      variables will be summarized by frequencies while continuous variables will be summarized
      using mean, standard deviation and/or median, twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles,
      minimum, and maximum. This is a minimal risk study using data that will be collected
      retrospectively from medical charts. The only potential risk would be loss of
      confidentiality.

        The study cohort will consist of any SOT or HSCT recipient ≤18 years of age that received
        their transplant between January 1st, 2010 and June 30th, 2013. Participants will have
        information collected from 30 days prior to transplant until the first of the following:
        365 days post receipt of transplant, death, or loss to follow-up. If a patient has more
        than one viral respiratory infection of the same pathogen during the study period, then
        only the first infection will be considered unless isolated at least one month after the
        first positive test and only if after at least two negative tests for that same virus. A
        patient can contribute more than one viral respiratory infection if they are caused by
        different viral pathogens.
