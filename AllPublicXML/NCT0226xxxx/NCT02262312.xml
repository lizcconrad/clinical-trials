  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have an ineffective hemopoiesis and often suffer
      from anemia. This can lead to red blood cell transfusion dependency and iron overload. Iron
      overload can affect the liver and lead to liver fibrosis and worst case cirrhosis. Ferritin
      is usually used to monitor the iron overload. In this study MDS patients will have a
      transient elastography performed which measures the liver's stiffness. The purpose is to
      investigate whether liver stiffness measurements are coherent to ferritin levels.

    <textblock>
      Transient elastography is noninvasive and has no side effects. No liver biopsy will be
      performed due to serious side-effects and risks in this patientgroup.

      The results of the transient elastography will be compared to the patient's ferritin levels
      and the numbers of months the patients have had MDS to find out if there is a correlation.
      Furthermore we will compare the liver stiffness measurements in the patients with higher
      ferritin levels to those who have lower ferritin levels. We will also compare the liver
      stiffness measurements in patients who are red blood cell transfusion dependent compared to
      those who are red blood cell transfusion independent. We will also compare liver stiffness
      measurements in the patients with a high alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) compared to those
      with normal ALAT.
