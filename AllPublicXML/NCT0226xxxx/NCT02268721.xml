  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research and Innovation program Food'n'Go - Empower aims to develop, test and implement a
      health technology solution for involvement and increased empowerment of elderly patients and
      their relatives. The focus is on frequent issues for this group of patients, in the first
      phase focusing on nutrition and physical activity. Later, the solution will include pain
      management, management of sleep problems, management of medication, prevention of confusion
      and coordination of the treatment and care course across sectorial borders. The technology is
      a tablet-computer, operated by the patient by means of a number of app-like software
      applications.

      The program received in the summer of 2013 one of the Capital Region OPI funding for design
      and development of the prototype, which is now ready and looking very promising. The next
      step is a pilot feasibility study testing the usability and acceptability as well as effect
      during hospitalisation and at home after discharge. The present study - Food'to'Go
      investigates the intervention in the post-discharge period.

      Aim The overall aim of Food'n'Go research- an innovation programme is to develop, test and
      implement innovative information technology solutions to increase participation and
      empowerment of older patients and their families, in relation to frequent problems during
      hospitalisation and the time after.

      The aim for the substudy Food'to'Go is to test the feasibility and efficacy of ICT-supported
      energy- and protein-enforced home-delivered main and in-between meals on older patients,
      discharged from acute hospitalisation in medical wards. Hereunder:

        -  Test the technology's relevance, suitability, acceptability and ease of use in relation
           to the target group

        -  Test the communication loop between patient and kitchen, and relatives external access
           to the related website

      Welfare and health technologies are often directed at solving problems and meeting the needs
      of society's most vulnerable groups, often not familiar with computers. We will, in addition
      to developing the technological solution, examine user-related barriers and preferences for
      health technology and try to find solutions that can increase older people's possibilities
      for using technology and achieve empowerment. The program incorporates research and
      innovation in an iterative process where research provides answers and solutions to the
      issues arising in relation to the development of the technology (innovation) and the use of
      it.

    <description>Intervention: Tablet Computer
Patients in the intervention group receives a tablet upon discharge from the hospital. The tablet contains an app, which the patients in the intervention group can use for ordering meals for delivery from the kitchen at the hospital three times a week. The app also ask the patients to register their own dietary intake, and give them feedback on their daily energy and protein intake.
Baseline measurements and records are taken at prior to discharge from the hospital, and after six and twelve weeks.</description>
