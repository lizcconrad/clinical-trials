      Aim : to validate the qualitative analysis by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of lung
      samples first in induced sputum in correlation to disease second by comparing hazardous
      particles in induced sputum to the analysis in lung tissue and finally by assessing if the
      particles present in transplanted patients correlated with occupational history.

      Abstract

      Background: On the last few years there is a rise in the public awareness of the danger
      potential that lies in the exposure to hazardous dust in different professions. The
      examination of induced sputum has been used from the early eighties to research and diagnose
      inflammatory lung diseases. We assess here patients with lung disease and occupational
      history, in order to undergo work up to assess hazardous dust exposure.

      Aim : to validate the qualitative analysis by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of lung
      samples first in induced sputum in correlation to disease second by comparing hazardous
      particles in induced sputum to the analysis in lung tissue and finally by assessing if the
      particles present in transplanted patients correlated with occupational history.

      Methods: 40 patients referred with occupational history were included. For 24 of them SEM
      analysis was done in induced sputum (IS) together with questionnaires and in 11 among them
      the SEM analysis was done both from lung tissue (TS) and IS. In addition 11 lung biopsies
      from patients with occupational history were scanned by SEM and compared to 10 biopsies from
      patients with no occupational history.
