      Evaluation of ranibizumab on the ease and procedure and complication in proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) requiring vitrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of multiple doses of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab in patients with severe NPDR and PDR prior to, during, and after vitrectomy
      therapy.

      40 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 3:1 to ranibizumab or vitrectomy alone. 30
      consented, enrolled subjects will receive 3 intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab
      administered 1-3 weeks pre-procedure, intraoperatively, and 1 month post-vitrectomy.
