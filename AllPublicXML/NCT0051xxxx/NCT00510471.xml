  <brief_title>Personalized Active Immunotherapy (Vaccine Therapy) and Sargramostim Given After Standard of Care Treatment With Rituximab and Chemotherapy for Initial Treatment With Lymphoma</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 2 Multi-Center, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Patient-Specific Immunotherapy, Recombinant Idiotype Conjugated to KLH (Id-KLH) and Administered With GM-CSF, in Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (fNHL) Following Primary Treatment With Rituximab and Chemotherapy (R-Chemo)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment being investigated is a patient- and tumor-specific therapy known as a
      personalized active immunotherapy. Personalized active immunotherapy is an attempt to use a
      person's own immune system to combat disease. Sargramostim (a.k.a. GM-CSF) is given together
      with the personalized active immunotherapy because it may increase the immune system's
      response and, therefore, aid in the effect of the personalized active immunotherapy.

      This approach has previously been studied in patients with follicular Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      and other B-cell malignancies. Encouraging efficacy results and a favorable safety profile
      have been seen to date in these studies.
