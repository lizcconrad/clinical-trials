      This randomized controlled, multi-center study will carry out to assess the efficacy of
      GB-0998 compared to plasmapheresis in the treatment of the generalized Myasthenia Gravis
      based on the changes in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (QMG score) as primary endpoint,
      and in addition, to assess the safety of GB-0998
