      Patients who have had laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of achalasia will be asked to
      have pH studies done in order to determine is these patients suffer from reflux after
      surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients who have laparoscopic Heller myotomies
      for the treatment of achalasia suffer from reflux after the surgery. Patients at our
      institution who have had surgery for achalasia will be asked to have pH studies done to
      determine whether or not these patients have reflux.
