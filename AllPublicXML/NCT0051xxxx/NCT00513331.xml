    <textblock>
      This is a study of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). It
      aims to look at the long term efficacy of evidence-based cutting edge diagnostic and
      therapeutic algorithms and techniques such as radiofrequency ablation, endoscopic mucosal
      resection and surveillance endoscopy with biopsy. Additionally, biological analyses will be
      performed in hopes of identifying biomarkers associated with the progression of BE to
      esophageal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a known premalignant condition of the esophagus, predisposing to
      the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. BE represents a change in the lining (mucosa)
      of the esophagus which is known to be produced as a result of chronic gastroesophageal
      reflux. The current standard of care for patients with BE includes serial performance of
      upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies, performed at designated time intervals. However, the
      emergence of new technologies for the management of this condition has made the care of these
      patients non-uniform, and subject to biases of individual treating physicians.

      The protocol at The Valley Hospital and Blumenthal Cancer Center aims to standardize the
      management of patients with Barrett's esophagus, with and without dysplasia, using
      evidence-based, cutting edge diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms and techniques such as
      radiofrequency ablation, endoscopic mucosal resection, and surveillance endoscopy with
      biopsies. If biopsies suggest the development of carcinoma or high grade dysplasia surgical
      removal of the esophagus is recommended. This study aims to look at the long-term efficacy of
      these procedures. In addition, data regarding clinical outcomes will be collected as well as
      blood, tissue and surgical specimens for proteomic analysis in hopes of identifying
      biomarkers associated with the progression of dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. Although patients
      will ultimately make their own informed decisions regarding the management of their BE, this
      protocol serves to unify physician recommendations, and allows for the collection and
      interpretation of data.
