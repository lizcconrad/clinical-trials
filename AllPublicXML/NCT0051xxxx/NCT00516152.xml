  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of performing
      unrelated stem cell transplants using intravenous busulfan and fludarabine as preparative
      therapy and tacrolimus plus methotrexate as the GVHD prophylaxis regimen. The goal is to
      demonstrate safety, aiming for a transplant related mortality rate (TRM) of &lt; or equal to 40%
      at 100 days. A TRM of &gt; or equal to 60% will be considered unacceptable. Another goal is to
      demonstrate efficacy by showing and overall survival of &gt;40% at 1-year following transplant.
