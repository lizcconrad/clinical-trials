    <textblock>
      Geriatric patients have a high risk of developing postoperative cognitive deficits.
      Hypothetical causes are insufficient intraoperative cerebral perfusion or drugs that are
      administered in the perioperative setting. This study will investigate the role of these two
      factors in patients aged 65 or older undergoing elective surgical procedures under general
      aesthesia. Non-invasive techniques will be used to monitor intraoperative cerebral perfusion
      and anticholinergic activity in the patient's blood is determined. Data will be compared to
      those of a young (20-40 year old) group of patients undergoing elective surgical procedures
      using an identical anesthetic technique. A second control group of healthy volunteers older
      than 65 will be investigated to quantify practice effects with repeated testing of cognitive
      functions.
