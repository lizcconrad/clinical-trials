      The primary objective of this study is to examine transplant related mortality (TRM) at 100
      days &lt;30%. A TRM of &gt;50% is considered unacceptable. This study also seeks a TRM at 12 months
      that is &lt;50%, engraftment &gt;90% (defined as donor cells &gt;80% at 6 months), and 1 year overall
      survival &gt;50%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt;75 years old

          -  Availability of suitable matched unrelated donor. We will require HLA matching at 9 of
             10 loci including HLA A, B, C, DR and DQ. For patients treated at UCSF, typing will be
             done in the UCSF Immunogenetics Department. Typing will be done by high-resolution
             techniques at the allele level. Donors will be recruited through the National Marrow
             Donor Program (NMDP). Donors must meet the standards of NMDP as well as Institutional
             standards for donors at the center for which they are being collected.

          -  Disease must be stable or responding to therapy. The expected time to disease
             progression should be greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Disease types include:

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This will
                  include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (-7, -7q, -5, -5q, complex, Ph+),
                  evolution from prior myelodysplasia or AML secondary to prior chemotherapy,
                  failure to achieve remission, or second or subsequent remission. To ensure
                  adequate time until disease progression, marrow blasts must be &lt;10%. This may be
                  achieved using chemotherapy treatment.

               -  Myelodysplasia with high-risk features. These will include adverse cytogenetics
                  (-7, -7q, -5, -5q, complex), excess blasts, prior conversion to AML, or severe
                  cytopenias, with ANC&lt;500uL or platelets &lt;20,000uL. Marrow blasts must be &lt;10%.
                  This may be achieved using chemotherapy.

               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This
                  will include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (Ph+, 11q23 abnormalities, and
                  monosomy 7), patients requiring more than one induction course to achieve
                  remission, as well as patients failing to enter remission or in second or
                  subsequent remission. Marrow blasts must be &lt;10%.

               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high-risk features. This will include
                  refractoriness to initial or subsequent therapy, progression after initial
                  response to therapy, or prolymphocytic (PLL) morphology.

               -  Follicular lymphoma with high-risk features. This will include refractoriness to
                  initial or subsequent therapy, progression after response to initial therapy, or
                  &gt; or equal 3 IPI risk factors.

               -  Multiple myeloma, stage II-III. Patients are eligible either at diagnosis or
                  after initial progression.

               -  Other lymphomas including diffuse large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or
                  Hodgkin's disease which as failed to respond to primary therapy, progressed or
                  recurred after prior therapy.

               -  Myeloproliferative diseases (myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera essential
                  thrombocytosis) with evidence of disease acceleration.

               -  Chronic myeloid leukemia with failure disease control by Imatinib.

               -  Renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease

               -  Aplastic anemia not responsive to immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Laboratory requirements (within 2 weeks of entry, EF and DLCO within 4 weeks):
             --Creatinine ,2.0mg/dL and creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min

               -  Bilirubin &lt;3mg/dL, AST &lt;4x upper limit of normal. Patients with elevated total
                  bilirubin who are suspected of having Gilbert's Disease will be eligible if the
                  direct bilirubin is normal.

               -  Patients with hepatitis C and hepatitis B are eligible if bilirubin and AST meet
                  above criteria

               -  Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;30%

               -  DLCO &gt;40% predicted

               -  Negative pregnancy test (for females of reproductive age)

          -  Absence of uncontrolled active infection.

          -  Prior stem cell (or bone marrow) transplantation is permitted

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring ongoing antibiotic treatment

          -  Poor performance status

          -  Rapid progression of malignant disease

          -  Opinion of BMT Committee that autologous transplant would be a preferable form of
             treatment

          -  Organ function below requirements

          -  Pregnancy
