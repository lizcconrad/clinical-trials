    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial was carried out at primary care level in Santiago, Chile to
      investigate a combined treatment for women suffering post-natal depression and preventing the
      adverse consequences of this illness on infant's growth and development.

      Background: We compared the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention with usual care
      to treat postnatal depression among low-income mothers in primary care clinics in Santiago,
      Chile.

      Methods: Randomised controlled trial. Two hundred and thirty mothers with major depression
      attending postnatal clinics were randomly allocated to either a multi-component intervention
      or usual care. The multi-component intervention involved a psychoeducational group, treatment
      adherence support, and pharmacotherapy if needed. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat
      basis. The main outcome measure was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3 and
      6 months after randomisation.
