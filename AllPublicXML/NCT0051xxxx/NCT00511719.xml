        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Current regimen of intensified insulin therapy (defined as separate injections of
             basal and prandial insulin with at least three injections per day) for at least six
             months prior to the study, including the use of long-lasting insulin analogue glargine
             (Lantus)

          -  Patients must have been willing to withhold insulin glargine for 24 hours prior to
             study drug dosing

          -  18 to 65 years old

          -  Body Mass Index &lt;35kg/m2

          -  Non-smoker for at least 2 years

          -  If medications (other than oral anti-diabetic agents) in addition to insulin were
             taken at screening, the patient had to be on a stable regimen as defined by continued
             use of the same dose of each medication for a period of at least 3 months immediately
             prior to study enrollment

          -  FVC, FEV1, and VC all &gt;80% of expected normal

             may interfere with the interpretation of clinical trials results or that is known to
             cause clinically relevant interference with insulin action, glucose utilization or
             recovery from hypoglycemia (eg, systematic steroid)

          -  HIstory of hypersensitivity to the drug or to drugs with similar chemical structures

          -  History of presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic (as evidenced by
             ALT or AST &gt;3 times the normal reference range), gastrointestinal, neurological, or
             infectious disorders capable of altering the absorption, metabolism or elimination of
             drugs, or constituting a significant risk factor when taking the study medications

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin concentrations &lt;11 g/dL for females of &lt;g/dL for males)

          -  Ongoing respiratory tract infection

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, or intention to become pregnant

          -  Women of child-bearing potential practicing inadequate birth control (adequate birth
             control was defined as using oral contraceptives, condoms, or diaphragms with
             spermicide, intrauterine devices, or surgical sterilization)

          -  Regular alcohol intake greater than 14 units*/week, or patients unwilling to stop
             alcohol during the duration of the study (*1 unit=8 g ethanol, 1/4 liter of beer or 1
