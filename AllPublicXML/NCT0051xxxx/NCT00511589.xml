  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T. cruzi infection affects approximately five million people in Brazil. The diagnosis of the
      chronic phase of infection is performed by indirect serological methods which, nevertheless,
      leave inconclusive results. One of the direct methods used for T. cruzi identification, blood
      culture in LIT (liver infusion tryptose) medium, presents low sensitivity in that phase of
      the disease. A negative result does not eliminate the possibility of infection, but a
      positive test has high absolute diagnostic value, which enables the indication of
      antiparasitic treatment. Molecular diagnosis (PCR) in this phase is promising and can be used
      as a confirmatory test, particularly when individuals present inconclusive results in
      conventional serological tests, such as ELISA, HAI and IFI. This study aimed at improving
      blood culture sensitivity in LIT medium by performing PCR in individuals with positive and
      inconclusive serology for chagasic infection.
