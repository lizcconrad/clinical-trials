  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. This Phase IIb study is designed to evaluate the the long-term efficacy,
      safety and immunogenicity of the 580299 HPV vaccine (CervarixTM) in a Brazilian cohort of
      women vaccinated in the phase IIb, blinded, primary study 580299/001 (NCT00689741) and having
      participated in follow-up study 580299/007 (NCT00120848). Only subjects who participated in
      the primary &amp; follow-up study will be enrolled in this long-term follow-up study. Subjects
      were aged 15-25 years at the time of entry into the primary study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

      In this extension study, women who were vaccinated in the primary study, and participated in
      the follow-up study, will be followed with visits every 6 months.

        <description>Persistent cervical HPV infection (6-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at 2 consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 5 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

        <description>Persistent cervical HPV infection (12-month definition) was defined as detection of the same HPV type in cervical specimens at all consecutive evaluations over a minimum of 10 months.
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had a normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at month 6 in the primary study.</description>

Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at Month 6 in the primary study</description>

        <description>Abnormal cytology included atypical squamus cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), atypical glandular cells (AGC), atypical squamus cells and cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H).
Subjects with an event did not report the same event in the earlier studies. Subjects were DNA negative for the 14 oncogenic HPV types and had normal cytology at baseline in the primary study. Subjects with an event were DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at Month 6 in the primary study.</description>
