    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of performing umbilical
      cord blood transplants in older adults or younger infirm patients with high-risk
      hematopoeitic malignancies. A novel reduced-intensity preparative regimen for umbilical cord
      blood transplantation will be used. One to a maximum of three cord blood units, depending on
      cell count, will be administered to facilitate engraftment. Ten patients will be enrolled
      with an expected accrual rate of 3-4 patients per year and with a goal of completing accrual
      within 2-3 years.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the feasibility of performing umbilical cord blood transplants in older adults
           or younger infirm patients using a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Feasibility of
           the procedure is defined as an engraftment rate of &gt;80% at Day 180 post-transplantation
           and a transplant related mortality (TRM) of &lt;50% at Day 100. A TRM of &gt;50% will be
           considered unacceptable.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery following mini-UCB
           transplantation.

        -  To assess lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to describe the
           contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoeisis.

        -  To describe disease-specific, event-free and overall survival rates at 180 and 360 days.

        -  To describe the incidence, severity, and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following
           reduced-intensity UCB transplantation.

        -  To evaluate T-cell, B-cell, and NK cell recovery following reduced-intensity UCB
           transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 55-70 years, or &lt; 55 years if deemed ineligible for conventional high dose
             chemotherapy by the UCSF SCT Committee or by protocol eligibility requirements for
             myeloablative therapy. Reasons for ineligibility for myeloablative therapy include:

               -  Poor cardiac function (i.e. LVEF &lt; 40%)

               -  Poor pulmonary function (i.e. DLCO &lt; 50%)

               -  Hepatic dysfunction

               -  Prior myeloablative therapy

          -  Availability of donor cord blood (one to three units) matching at &gt; or equal to 4 of 6
             HLA antigens (A, B, and DR). HLA class I antigens will be determined by serologic
             methods, and Class II antigens will be determined by high-resolution DNA typing.
             Typing will be confirmed by the UCSF Immunogenetics Department. The target UCB TNC
             dose is &gt; or equal to 3.5 x 10(7) TNC/kg recipient weight, however the absolute
             minimum TNC requirement is &gt; 2.5 x 10(7) TNC per kilogram) based on cell counts prior
             to cryopreservation. Cord blood units will be obtained from all available
             international banks.

                  required, chemotherapy may be given to achieve target levels of blasts. Patients
                  are expected to have disease control or not rapidly progressive disease
                  regardless of blast count (but must be &lt; or equal to 20%).
