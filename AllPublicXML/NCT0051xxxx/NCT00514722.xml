  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of performing umbilical
      cord blood transplants in adults with high-risk hematopoietic malignancies. A novel
      myeloablative preparative regimen will be used. One, up to a maximum of three cord blood
      units will be administered to facilitate engraftment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to demonstrate an engraftment rate of &gt;80% at day 100 post-transplantation
      and a transplant related mortality rate of &lt; or equal to 50%. A TRM of &gt;50% will be
      considered unacceptable. The present research will also:

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of busulfan, fludarabine, and etoposide as preparative therapy
           prior to umbilical cord blood cell transplantation.

        -  Evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery following UCB transplantation.

        -  Evaluate lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to assess the
           contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoiesis.

        -  Evaluate event free and overall survival.

        -  Evaluate the incidence, severity and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following UCB
           transplantation.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; or equal to 55

          -  Availability of donor cord blood (one to three units) matching at least 4 of 6 HLA
             antigens (A, B, and DR). HLA class I antigens will be determined by serologic methods,
             and Class II antigens will be determined by high-resolution DNA typing. Typing will be
             confirmed by UCSF Immunogenetics Department following infusion. The UCB units must
             contain &gt;2.5 x 10(7) TNC per kilogram recipient body weight. Cord blood units will be
             obtained from all available international banks.

          -  HLA identical or 1 antigen mismatched related donors or potential HLA-matched
             unrelated donors (MUD) matching at &gt;6/8 (A, B,C, DR) alleles must NOT be available.

          -  Disease types:

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This will
                  include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (-7, -7q, -5, -5q, t(6,9), t(9,11),
                  complex, Ph+), evolution from prior myelodysplasia or AML secondary to prior
                  chemotherapy, failure to achieve remission, or second or subsequent remission. To
                  ensure adequate time until disease progression, marrow blasts must be &lt; or equal
                  to 10%. This may be achieved using chemotherapy treatment.

               -  Myelodysplasia with high-risk features. This will include patients with IPSS
                  category INT2 or HI-risk MDS. Marrow blasts must be &lt; or equal to 20%. If
                  required, chemotherapy may be given to achieve target levels of blasts.

               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia not expected to be curable with chemotherapy. This
                  will include patients with high-risk cytogenetics (Ph+, t(4,11), 11q23
                  abnormalities, and monosomy 7), patients requiring more than one induction course
                  to achieve remission, as well as patients failing to enter remission or in second
                  or subsequent remission. To ensure adequate time until disease progression,
                  marrow blasts must be &lt; or equal to 10%. If required, chemotherapy may be given
                  to achieve target levels of blasts.

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia with advanced disease. This will include patients
                  with accelerated or blastic phase or patients with chronic phase refractory to
                  STI-5741. To ensure adequate time until disease progression, patients with blast
                  crisis must show marrow blasts &lt; or equal to 10%. If required, chemotherapy may
                  be given to achieve target levels of blasts.

               -  Multiple myeloma, stage II-III with &gt;1st relapse or refractory disease or newly
                  diagnosed with chromosome 13 abnormalities.

             hour urine collection)

          -  Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dL, AST/alkaline phosphatase &lt;3x upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with hepatitis C and active Hepatitis B are eligible only if a liver biopsy
