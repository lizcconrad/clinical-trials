    <description>Used to determine the level of daytime sleepiness. The ESS is a self-rated questionnaire with 8 items that describe normative daily situations known to vary in their soporific qualities. Subjects rate the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in each of these situations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing). The item scores are summed to produce a total score (range of 0-24). Score &gt;10 (95th percentile) are considered to be suggestive of significant daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Responders by Baseline Smoking Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline smoking status was recorded and associations to response to treatment were determined. Response was defined as 25% or greater decrease in ADHD symptoms as measured by the CAARS-Inv:SV total ADHD symptom score. The 18-item total CAARS-Inv:SV ADHD symptom score is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscales. Each item is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0=not at all, never; 1=just a little, once in a while; 2=pretty much, often; 3=very much, very frequently). The scale assesses symptom severity over the past week. The total score ranges from 0 to 54.</description>

    <measure>Strong Responders by Baseline Smoking Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline smoking status was recorded and associations to response to treatment were determined. Strong response was defined as 40% or greater decrease in ADHD symptoms as measured by the CAARS-Inv:SV total ADHD symptom score. The 18-item total CAARS-Inv:SV ADHD symptom score is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscales. Each item is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0=not at all, never; 1=just a little, once in a while; 2=pretty much, often; 3=very much, very frequently). The scale assesses symptom severity over the past week. The total score ranges from 0 to 54.</description>

          <title>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version Self Report - Self Monitor</title>
          <description>The BRIEF-A Self Monitor assesses an individuals' capacity to self monitor in his or her everyday environment. The self-report form is designed to be completed by adults 18-90 years of age, including adults with a wide variety of developmental, systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Observations are rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with 1=behavior is never observed, 2=behavior is sometimes observed, and 3=behavior is often observed - higher ratings indicate greater perceived impairment. The total score ranges from 6 to 18.</description>

          <description>Used to determine the level of daytime sleepiness. The ESS is a self-rated questionnaire with 8 items that describe normative daily situations known to vary in their soporific qualities. Subjects rate the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in each of these situations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing). The item scores are summed to produce a total score (range of 0-24). Score &gt;10 (95th percentile) are considered to be suggestive of significant daytime sleepiness.</description>

The 18-item total ADHD symptom score is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscales. Each item is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0=not at all, never; 1=just a little, once in a while; 2=pretty much, often; 3=very much, very frequently). The scale assesses symptom severity over the past week. The total score ranges from 0 to 54.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version Self Report (BRIEF-A) - Emotional Control Section Score</title>
        <description>The BRIEF-A emotional control subscale assesses an individuals emotional control in his or her everyday environment. The self-report form is designed to be completed by adults 18-90 years of age, including adults with a wide variety of developmental, systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Behavior is rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with 1=behavior is never observed, 2=behavior is sometimes observed, and 3=behavior is often observed - higher ratings indicate greater perceived impairment. The total score ranges from 10 to 30.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version Self Report (BRIEF-A) - Inhibit Section</title>
          <description>The BRIEF-A Inhibit rates an individual's inhibition in his or her everyday environment. The self-report form is designed to be completed by adults 18-90 years of age, including adults with a wide variety of developmental, systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Behavior is rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with 1=behavior is never observed, 2=behavior is sometimes observed, and 3=behavior is often observed - higher ratings indicate greater perceived impairment. The total score ranges from 8 to 24.</description>

        <description>The BRIEF-A Plan/Organize asseses an individuals' capabilities to plan and organize in his or her everyday environment. The self-report form is designed to be completed by adults 18-90 years of age, including adults with a wide variety of developmental, systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Behavior is rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with 1=behavior is never observed, 2=behavior is sometimes observed, and 3=behavior is often observed - higher ratings indicate greater perceived impairment. The total score ranges from 10 to 30.</description>

The self-report form is designed to be completed by adults 18-90 years of age, including adults with a wide variety of developmental, systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Observations are rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with 1=behavior is never observed, 2=behavior is sometimes observed, and 3=behavior is often observed - higher ratings indicate greater perceived impairment. The total score ranges from 8 to 24.</description>

        <description>Used to determine the level of daytime sleepiness. The ESS is a self-rated questionnaire with 8 items that describe normative daily situations known to vary in their soporific qualities. Subjects rate the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in each of these situations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing). The item scores are summed to produce a total score (range of 0-24). Score &gt;10 (95th percentile) are considered to be suggestive of significant daytime sleepiness.</description>

        <title>Responders by Baseline Smoking Status</title>
        <description>Baseline smoking status was recorded and associations to response to treatment were determined. Response was defined as 25% or greater decrease in ADHD symptoms as measured by the CAARS-Inv:SV total ADHD symptom score. The 18-item total CAARS-Inv:SV ADHD symptom score is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscales. Each item is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0=not at all, never; 1=just a little, once in a while; 2=pretty much, often; 3=very much, very frequently). The scale assesses symptom severity over the past week. The total score ranges from 0 to 54.</description>
