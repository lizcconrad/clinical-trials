    <measure>Time to Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based as Per Investigator Using Kaplan-Meier Methodology</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomisation to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 17 August 2007, until cut-off date 28 February 2010</time_frame>
    <description>Progression of disease is defined as the time from study start to the date of first documented progression of disease or death due to any cause. Progression of disease is defined by RECIST criteria: Progression = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, from the smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline; or a new lesion; or progression of non-target lesions.</description>

    <description>Objective Response defined by RECIST criteria: Partial response (PR) must have ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, from the baseline sum. Complete response (CR) must have disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments within 4 weeks . Progression = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, from the smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline; or a new lesion; or progression of non-target lesions</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, to death- no time limit</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Analyses were performed using all deaths in the FAS population regardless of whether they were observed during the double-blind treatment period, the open-label treatment period, the post-treatment evaluations, or the survival follow-up period.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival According to Ki-67 Levels Categorized as: Less Than or Equal to 2%, &gt; 2% to Less Than or Equal to 5% and &gt; 5%</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomisation to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 17 August 2007, until cut-off date 28 February 2010</time_frame>
    <description>The level of Ki 67 expression for evaluable tumor samples were analyzed towards progression free survival (PFS) as per local investigator assessment. The Ki-67 protein is a cellular marker for proliferation. It is strictly associated with cell proliferation. During interphase, the Ki-67 antigen can be exclusively detected within the cell nucleus, whereas in mitosis most of the protein is relocated to the surface of the chromosomes. Baseline Ki 67 levels were categorized as: less than or equal to 2%, &gt; 2% to less than or equal to 5% and &gt; 5%.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival According to Chromogramin A Tumor Marker (CgA) Baseline Level and According to CgA Early Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomisation to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 17 August 2007, until cut-off date 28 February 2010</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline levels of serum CgA SE were characterized towards progression free survival (PFS) as per local investigator assessment, relative to the upper limited of normal (ULN). CgA levels exceeding 2 x ULN were considered to be 'Elevated' otherwise considered as &quot;Non-elevated&quot;. An 'early response' (applicable to only those patients with elevated levels at baseline) was defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% from baseline to Cycle 2 Day 1 or normalization by Cycle 2 Day 1. CgA is widely expressed in well-differentiated pancreatic NET. CgA is present in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. Pancreatic NET patients often present with elevated circulating levels of CgA in their blood. Baseline levels of these biomarkers are considered as prognostic factors.</description>

    <description>Baseline levels of serum NSE were characterized towards PFS as per local investigator assessment, relative to the upper limited of normal (ULN). NSE levels exceeding ULN were considered to be 'Elevated' otherwise considered as &quot;Non-elevated&quot;. An 'early response' (applicable to only those patients with elevated levels at baseline) was defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% from baseline to Cycle 2 Day 1 or normalization by Cycle 2 Day 1. NSE is widely expressed in well-differentiated pancreatic NET. NSE is usually expressed in the cytoplasm. Pancreatic NET patients often present with elevated circulating levels of NSE in their blood. Baseline levels of these biomarkers are considered as prognostic factors.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival According to Ki-67 Levels Categorized as: Less Than or Equal to 2%, &gt; 2% to Less Than or Equal to 5% and &gt; 5%</title>
        <description>The level of Ki 67 expression for evaluable tumor samples were analyzed towards progression free survival (PFS) as per local investigator assessment. The Ki-67 protein is a cellular marker for proliferation. It is strictly associated with cell proliferation. During interphase, the Ki-67 antigen can be exclusively detected within the cell nucleus, whereas in mitosis most of the protein is relocated to the surface of the chromosomes. Baseline Ki 67 levels were categorized as: less than or equal to 2%, &gt; 2% to less than or equal to 5% and &gt; 5%.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival According to Chromogramin A Tumor Marker (CgA) Baseline Level and According to CgA Early Response</title>
        <description>Baseline levels of serum CgA SE were characterized towards progression free survival (PFS) as per local investigator assessment, relative to the upper limited of normal (ULN). CgA levels exceeding 2 x ULN were considered to be 'Elevated' otherwise considered as &quot;Non-elevated&quot;. An ‘early response’ (applicable to only those patients with elevated levels at baseline) was defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% from baseline to Cycle 2 Day 1 or normalization by Cycle 2 Day 1. CgA is widely expressed in well-differentiated pancreatic NET. CgA is present in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. Pancreatic NET patients often present with elevated circulating levels of CgA in their blood. Baseline levels of these biomarkers are considered as prognostic factors.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival According to Neuron Specific Enolase Tumor Marker (NSE) Baseline Level and According to NSE Early Response</title>
        <description>Baseline levels of serum NSE were characterized towards PFS as per local investigator assessment, relative to the upper limited of normal (ULN). NSE levels exceeding ULN were considered to be 'Elevated' otherwise considered as &quot;Non-elevated&quot;. An ‘early response’ (applicable to only those patients with elevated levels at baseline) was defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% from baseline to Cycle 2 Day 1 or normalization by Cycle 2 Day 1. NSE is widely expressed in well-differentiated pancreatic NET. NSE is usually expressed in the cytoplasm. Pancreatic NET patients often present with elevated circulating levels of NSE in their blood. Baseline levels of these biomarkers are considered as prognostic factors.</description>

        <title>Analysis of Time to Definitive Deterioration of WHO Performance Status Using Kaplan-Meier</title>
        <description>Time to definitive worsening is defined as a definitive increase in performance status from a baseline of 0 or 1 to WHO &gt;= 2, or from a baseline value of 2 to WHO &gt;= 3. If no earlier deterioration, patients were censored at the end of follow-up or at the start of further antineoplastic therapy. Rates of patients with no deterioration at 3 and 6 months were computed using Kaplan-meier method. Grade 0: Able to carry out all activity without restriction; Grade 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory &amp; able to do light work; Grade 2: Ambulatory &amp; capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work. Up &amp; about more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 3: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 4: Completely disabled &amp; cannot carry on any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair.</description>
