      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of physical exercise on gene expression
      in muscle biopsies from patients with chronic polymyositis or dermatomyositis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis according to the Bohan and Peter criteria
      and who had all participated in a resistive exercise trial at Karolinska University Hospital,
      Stockholm, Sweden, were included in this study. Patients were included if they had a disease
      duration more than 12 months and they had to have a stable, low disease activity and
      medication for three months before enrollment in the study. Patients with inclusion body
      myositis were excluded as well as patients with co morbidities that contradicted vigorous
      exercise (severe osteoporosis with multiple fractures, malignant disease severe lung disease)
      or if they were physically active more than once a week. The median disease duration at time
      of study start was 4.5 years (range 2,7-29 year). All patients had been treated with
      glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive therapies with some improvement of muscle
      function but with persisting muscle impairment. At time of study seven patients were still on
      immunosuppressive treatment, five were taking prednisone with a median dosage of 2.5 mg/day
      (range 0-6.25 mg/d). Six patients were treated with azathioprine, one in combination with
      cyclosporine A, one patient was treated with methotrexate and one with IVIG 2g/kg body weight
      every three months
