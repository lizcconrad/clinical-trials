    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tolerability and effectiveness of conventional
      treatment for mild to moderate arthritic or arthralgic symptoms while subjects are being
      treated with efalizumab for psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate that mild to moderate arthritis or arthralgia may be
      controlled using conventional therapy while being treated with efalizumab, without loss of
      efficacy.
