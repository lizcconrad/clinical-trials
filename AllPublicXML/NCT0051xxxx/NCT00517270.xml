  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac chest pain accounts for 2-5% of all emergency presentations. In the United
      States, it has been estimated approximately that US$8 billion was spent annually for the
      initial care of patients suspected to have an acute coronary syndrome, but who were
      subsequently found not to have coronary artery disease (1). The most common cause of
      non-cardiac chest pain is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (2). Two randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on the use of omeprazole versus placebo for the
      treatment of NCCP have been published in the western population and reported an efficacy of
      62% to 80% (3,4). High-dose omeprazole was used in the previous trials (3,4). Recently, it
      has been shown that rabeprazole, which is a newly developed benzimidazole proton pump
      inhibitor, is a more potent and rapid inhibitor of H+,K+-ATPase and acid secretion than
      omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole (5,6). Whether the above findings applied to
      Chinese population is unknown. Thus we would like to propose a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial to study the effects of high-dose proton pump inhibitor for the
      treatment of non-cardiac chest pain in Chinese population. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of high-dose proton pump inhibitor for the treatment of
      gastro-oesophageal reflux related non-cardiac chest pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory patients with age over 18 years old

          -  Patients with chest pain for at least 12 weeks, in the preceding 12 months who are
             evaluated by cardiac catheterization or exercise radionuclide scan / persantin
             radionuclide scan will be assessed for suitability to enter the study. Patients will
             be included if the results of the cardiac investigation are normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of significant cardiac, renal, pulmonary or hepatic diseases.

          -  Patients with history of gastrointestinal surgery or peptic ulcer diseases.

          -  Intake of H2 receptor blockers, bismuth or proton pump inhibitors or drugs affecting
             gastrointestinal motility in the preceding four weeks.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients who are suffering from costochrondritis.

          -  Patients who are known to be sensitive to proton pump inhibitor.

          -  Patients with glaucoma and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
