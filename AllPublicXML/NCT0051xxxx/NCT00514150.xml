    <textblock>
      Radio Contrast Induced Nephropathy (RCIN) remains a well recognized complication in patients
      undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures requiring radiographic contrast agents.
      Recent studies have shown benefit in administering Sodium Bicarbonate over normal saline( the
      uniformly accepted prophylaxy) in preventing RCIN.Therefore the aim of the study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate solved in normal saline compared with infusion of
      normal saline in prevention of RCIN.

      Radio Contrast Induced Nephropathy (RCIN) remains a well recognized complication in patients
      undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures requiring radiographic contrast agents and
      is the third leading cause of acquired acute renal failure in hospitalized patients.
      Strategies for the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy have focused on countering
      vasoconstriction (pre-hydration, fenoldopam, and theophylline), enhancing flow through the
      nephron (diuretics), or protection against oxygen-free-radical injury (urinary alkalinization
      and N-acetylcysteine).

      Among all prophylactic measures that have been proposed, adequate preprocedural and
      postprocedural hydration has demonstrated effectiveness in the prevention of radiocontrast
      nephropathy. Thus, it remains the most frequently applied measure in clinical practice.

      A Recent study in May 2004 have shown benefit in administering Sodium Bicarbonate over normal
      saline as a prophylaxy.Since alkalizing renal tubular fluid with bicarbonate may reduce
      injury.

      Comparisons: IV 154 mEq/L solution of NaCl 0.9% OR IV 154 mEq/ L sodium bicarbonate solved in
      154 mEq/ L NaCl 0.9%. Each fluid is infused at the rate of 3 ml/kg/ hour one hour before the
      angiographic procedure, continuing at the rate of 1 ml/kg/ hour for 6 hours after the
      procedure. Maximum rate of fluid permitted is that for a body weight of 110 Kg.
