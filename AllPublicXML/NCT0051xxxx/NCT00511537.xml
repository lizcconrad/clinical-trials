    <textblock>
      This study performs HLA matched stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors in adults who
      require stem cell transplantation but do not have a matched related donor available. The
      incidence of graft-versus-host disease in unrelated stem cell transplantation is recorded.
      This study also monitors the activity and toxicity of total body irradiation and
      cyclosphosphamide followed by stem cell transplantation from matched unrelated donors.

    <textblock>
      This protocol identifies a standard-of-care method for unrelated stem cell transplantation in
      adults. Performing this service in a consistent and documented fashion allows investigators
      to obtain informed consent from recipients. Data is tabulated locally for quality-control
      comparisons with nationally-reported standards. As a condition of maintaining transplant
      center status and to have acess to NMDP-registered donors, UCSF submits clinical and outcome
      data to the NMDP. As a result, UCSF is contributing to the resolution of remaining
      uncertainties regarding particular transplantation practices.
