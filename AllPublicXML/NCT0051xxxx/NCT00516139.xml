      This study is being conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of lamotrigine (LTG)
      in elderly patients with epilepsy. This study will be carried out using an extended-release
      formulation of lamotrigine (LTG-XR) that will allow once-a-day dosing.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Any Non-serious Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) until 3 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 30 or 33)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes its prolongation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. A complete list of all SAEs and AEs experienced in the study can be found in the SAE/AE section.</description>

    <description>Partial-onset sz. have a focal site of onset; sz. activity is initially limited to 1 brain hemisphere. Partial sz. can remain simple or complex, or evolve to generalized tonic-clonic sz. Participants (par.) recorded the number of sz., by type as well as the episode duration of innumerable sz. activity), in daily diaries. If par. withdrew from study, data were averaged for the study portion the par. completed up to the time of drug discontinuation. Percent change from BL = (BL value minus study phase value divided by BL value) x 100; positive values indicate reduction from BL in sz. frequency.</description>

Par. on a single concomitant AED who converted to LTG-XR monotherapy (based on investigator's judgment) entered the 5-w Conversion Phase, followed by an 8-w Monotherapy Phase, whereas par. who did not transition to monotherapy entered the 13-w Adjunctive Optimization Phase. At the end of the study, par. entered the 2- to 5-w Taper/Follow-Up Phase, in which par. either switched to commercial LTG (received same total daily dose of commercial LTG in 2 divided doses [BID]) or did not switch to commercial LTG (current dose was reduced by approximately one-fourth per week) with a final visit 2 weeks after last LTG-XR dose.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline in Weekly Seizure Frequency During Each Phase of the Study</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the number of seizures, by seizure type, as well as the duration of episodes of innumerable seizure activity in their daily diaries during all phases of the study. For participants who withdrew from the study, seizure data were averaged for the portion of the study the participant completed up to the time of study drug discontinuation. Participants who experienced a change from Baseline in the weekly seizure frequency were categorized as having a &gt;=25%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=75%, or 100% reduction or a &gt;=50% increase in percent change from Baseline in weekly seizure frequency.</description>

            <description>LTG-XR tablets (25, 50, 100, and 200 milligrams [mg]) administered once a day (OD) in the 7-week (w) Dose-Escalation Phase and titrated to target doses of 300, 500, or 200 mg/day for participants (par.) depending on their concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED), followed by an 8-w Adjunctive Maintenance Phase in which LTG-XR tablets were administered OD at the target dose. Par. on a single concomitant AED who converted to LTG-XR monotherapy (based on investigator's judgment) entered the 5-w Conversion Phase, followed by an 8-w Monotherapy Phase, whereas par. who did not transition to monotherapy entered the 13-w Adjunctive Optimization Phase. At the end of the study, par. entered the 2- to 5-w Taper/Follow-Up Phase, in which par. either switched to commercial LTG (received same total daily dose of commercial LTG in 2 divided doses [BID]) or did not switch to commercial LTG (current dose was reduced by approximately one-fourth per week) with a final visit 2 weeks after last LTG-XR dose.</description>

        <description>The blood samples collected at the study visits were analyzed and assessed at the central laboratory, and the investigator reviewed and assessed the clinical significance. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the value of basophil, eosinophil, hemoglobin, lymphocyte, monocyte, ANC, platelet count, and WBC count at the indicated time points in the study from the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>LTG-XR tablets (25, 50, 100, and 200 milligrams [mg]) administered once a day (OD) in the 7-week (w) Dose-Escalation Phase and titrated to target doses of 300, 500, or 200 mg/day for participants (par.) depending on their concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED), followed by an 8-w Adjunctive Maintenance Phase in which LTG-XR tablets were administered OD at the target dose. Par. on a single concomitant AED who converted to LTG-XR monotherapy (based on investigator's judgment) entered the 5-w Conversion Phase, followed by an 8-w Monotherapy Phase, whereas par. who did not transition to monotherapy entered the 13-w Adjunctive Optimization Phase. At the end of the study, par. entered the 2- to 5-w Taper/Follow-Up Phase, in which par. either switched to commercial LTG (received same total daily dose of commercial LTG in 2 divided doses [BID]) or did not switch to commercial LTG (current dose was reduced by approximately one-fourth per week) with a final visit 2 weeks after last LTG-XR dose.</description>

Par. on a single concomitant AED who converted to LTG-XR monotherapy (based on investigator's judgment) entered the 5-w Conversion Phase, followed by an 8-w Monotherapy Phase, whereas par. who did not transition to monotherapy entered the 13-w Adjunctive Optimization Phase. At the end of the study, par. entered the 2- to 5-w Taper/Follow-Up Phase, in which par. either switched to commercial LTG (received same total daily dose of commercial LTG in 2 divided doses [BID]) or did not switch to commercial LTG (current dose was reduced by approximately one-fourth per week) with a final visit 2 weeks after last LTG-XR dose.</description>

          <title>LTG-XR Tablets</title>
          <description>LTG-XR tablets (25, 50, 100, and 200 milligrams [mg]) administered once a day (OD) in the 7-week (w) Dose-Escalation Phase and titrated to target doses of 300, 500, or 200 mg/day for participants (par.) depending on their concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED), followed by an 8-w Adjunctive Maintenance Phase in which LTG-XR tablets were administered OD at the target dose. Par. on a single concomitant AED who converted to LTG-XR monotherapy (based on investigator's judgment) entered the 5-w Conversion Phase, followed by an 8-w Monotherapy Phase, whereas par. who did not transition to monotherapy entered the 13-w Adjunctive Optimization Phase. At the end of the study, par. entered the 2- to 5-w Taper/Follow-Up Phase, in which par. either switched to commercial LTG (received same total daily dose of commercial LTG in 2 divided doses [BID]) or did not switch to commercial LTG (current dose was reduced by approximately one-fourth per week) with a final visit 2 weeks after last LTG-XR dose.</description>
