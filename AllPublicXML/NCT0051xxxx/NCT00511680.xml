      The specific primary aims of the study are to:

        1. Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression in urban African
           American older adults (primary trial outcome; between group comparison). Hypothesis:
           Participants in the intervention group will report fewer depressive symptoms in
           comparison to control group participants receiving usual care.

        2. Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group
           comparison). Hypothesis: Participants in the intervention group will maintain reduced
           symptom presentation from 4 to 8 months.

        3. Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and extent of engagement in
           activities by study participants (both intervention and wait-list control subjects).

      A secondary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial
      embedded in a community service setting and its dissemination using a community-academic
      partnership. We also propose three exploratory aims. First, we seek to evaluate the
      mechanisms of action, or pathways, by which treatment gains are obtained (Gitlin et al.,
      2000). Given that behavioral activation represents conceptually the key active ingredient of
      the proposed intervention, we plan to evaluate its mediational effect. Second, we seek to
      evaluate whether the intervention has a differential treatment effect based on a study
      participant's gender, age, and living arrangement (alone or with others). Given that previous
      research suggests that participant characteristics may moderate depressive symptoms and
      treatment outcomes, these exploratory analyses will provide insight as to whether this
      particular treatment benefits some groups more than others. Third, we seek to evaluate
      whether the intervention has short and long-term effects on quality of life, functional
      difficulty, and self-efficacy to manage day-to-day tasks. Previous research has shown that
      depressive symptoms exacerbate functional decline such that minimizing distress may have the
      added value of enhancing function and perceived efficacy for this group over time.
