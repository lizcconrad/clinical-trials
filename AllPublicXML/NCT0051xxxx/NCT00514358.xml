  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in infants and
      evaluate the dose exposure relationship of current fluconazole dosing in infants who are
      receiving fluconazole for the prevention or treatment of systemic fungal infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic fungal infections in neonates are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The
      increasing use of intravenous central catheters, parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics in
      neonatal intensive care units has contributed not only to improved survival but also to the
      increasing incidence of fungal sepsis particularly in preterm infants. Decreasing fungal
      colonization can decrease the risk of systemic fungal infection. Fluconazole is a potent
      antifungal agent in the triazole family. Fluconazole has been shown to reduce the risk of
      fungal colonization and systemic infection however we do not have sufficient pharmacokinetic
      information in neonates to support dosing guidelines. In this study, we will perform a
      population pharmacokinetic study in neonates receiving fluconazole as standard of care.
      Fluconazole levels will be measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy
      (LC/MS/MS) assay from very small quantities of blood appropriate for neonates.
      Pharmacokinetic data obtained in this study will support appropriate dosing of fluconazole in
      neonates and provide information regarding drug metabolism in neonates.
