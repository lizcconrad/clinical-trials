    <textblock>
      This phase III is designed to confirm the previous trial results evaluating the safety,
      clinical tolerability and immunogenicity of the 2006-2007 formulation of Novartis Vaccines'
      adjuvanted influenza vaccine and subunit influenza vaccine in adults with underlying chronic
      diseases.
