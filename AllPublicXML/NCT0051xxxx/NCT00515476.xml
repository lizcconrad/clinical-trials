  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to characterize the quality of HDL-Cholesterol in
      patients with metabolic syndrome and reduced blood HDL-Cholesterol levels and to examine the
      effect of exercise training on the vasculoprotective effects of HDL-Cholesterol in these
      patients. Additionally the investigators aim to investigate the endothelial function,
      oxidative stress and the regenerative capacity of the endothelial progenitor cells in
      patients with metabolic syndrome and the changes dependent on physical activity of patients.
