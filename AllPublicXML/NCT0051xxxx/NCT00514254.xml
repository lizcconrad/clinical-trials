      RATIONALE: Learning about the risk factors for endometrial cancer in black women may help the
      study of endometrial cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying risk factors for endometrial cancer in black women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish and evaluate procedures for conducting a hospital-based case-control study of
           risk factors for endometrial cancer in black women.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants complete questionnaires about lifestyle factors and their usual diet and measure
      their waist and hips. Saliva or buccal specimens are collected for future research.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

        -  A total of 30 cases and 30 controls will be accrued for this study.

        Black women (including African-American, African, Afro-Caribbean women) with endometrial
        cancer and controls will be recruited at MSKCC, SUNY Downstate Medical Center and
        Montefiore Medical Center hospitals. Controls will be black (including African-American,
        African, Afro-Caribbean) women without history of cancer, who have intact uteri, and will
        be identified in gynecology clinics. Controls will also be recruited at the Breast
        Examination Center of Harlem (BECH), an affiliate of MSKCC, providing high quality
        screening services to a minority community.
