    <textblock>
      TAPS is a sequential trial which aims to investigate whether the administration of a blood
      transfusion pre-operatively to patients with sickle cell disease (HB SS or Hb SB0 thal)having
      low or medium risk elective surgery increases or decreases the overall rate of peri-operative
      complications. The proportion of patients with peri-operative complications in two randomised
      groups of transfused and untransfused patients will be compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sickle cell disease, either Hb SS or Hb SB0 thal, confirmed by Hb electrophoresis,
             Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) analysis or High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

          -  At least 24 hourse and no more than 14 days before surgery and a date for surgery has
             been given

          -  Surgery to be low or medium risk

          -  Surgery to be with general or regional anaesthesia

          -  Written informed consent from patient/parent/guardian is given

          -  More than six months since previous TAPS trial surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Having a procedure involving intravascular contrast radiography or an imaging
             procedure

          -  On a regular blood transfusion regime

          -  Had a blood transfusion within the last three months

          -  The planned procedure involves local anaesthetic only

          -  Haemoglobin level at randomisation less than 6.5g/dL

          -  Children with a clinical history of stroke (history of silent infarcts would not
             preclude randomisation)

          -  Acute chest syndrome within the last six months, or patient has ever required
             intubation and mechanical ventilation for treatment of acute chest syndrome

          -  Oxygen saturation at randomisation less than 90%

          -  Patient is on renal dialysis

          -  Already entered twice into the TAPS trial

          -  The physician is unwilling to randomise the patient (such patients will be entered
             into a trial log).
