  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulants that are widely used for the treatment of thrombo-embolic disease exert
      their effect by blocking the recycling of vitamin K. Vitamin K acts as a co-factor in the
      posttranslational carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as osteocalcin and
      matrix-gla protein. It is important to quantify the dose-response relationship of the
      interaction between vitamin K and oral anticoagulants and to investigate at what dosage
      vitamin K will interfere with oral anticoagulants in a clinically relevant way.

    <textblock>
      From all K-vitamins, menaquinone-7 has been identified as the most effective cofactor for the
      carboxylation reaction of Gla-proteins. In this respect it is important to quantify the
      dose-response relationship of the interaction between oral anticoagulants and menaquinone-7.
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate at what menaquinone-7 intake the vitamin
      will interfere with oral anticoagulants in a clinically relevant way. Clinically relevant is
      defined as a decrease in level of anticoagulation that would require a change in oral
      anticoagulant treatment in order to stay within target levels. Secondary objective of the
      study is to investigate changes in carboxylation level of osteocalcin and matrix-gla protein
      after menaquinone-7 supplementation during the oral anticoagulation treatment period. This
      will demonstrate whether during oral anticoagulation menaquinone-7 will be transported
      preferentially to the liver or to other target tissues.
