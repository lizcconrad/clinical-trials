      We hypothesized that pre-treatment with methylene blue could potentiate the effects of
      general anaesthetic agents in patients undergoing parathyroidectomy

      Sample and study design The local ethics committee granted approval for this study and
      informed written consent will be obtained from all participants. We will study ASA grade I or
      II patients, aged between 45 and 73 years who were free from cardiovascular and pulmonary
      diseases. Patients with psychiatric disorders or drug abuse as well as those weighing 20%
      more or less than their ideal body weight will all be excluded.

      The interventional group will consist of 11 patients scheduled for elective parathyroidectomy
      who will receive MB infusion (5mg.kg-1 in 250 ml 5% glucose-saline) approximately 60 min
      before anaesthesia induction. A further 11 patients scheduled for unilateral thyroid
      lobectomy without MB pre-treatment will be recruited as controls. They will present with
      normal thyroid tests and will carefully be selected in an attempt to match the intervention
      group on the basis of age, weight and sex. Both types of surgical procedures will be
      performed by the same surgical team.

      Anaesthesia and surgery All patients will be premedicated with oral midazolam 7.5 mg and they
      will receive a loading dose of lactate-ringer solution (5 ml.kg-1) intravenously after
      arrival in the operating theatre. The standard anaesthetic monitoring will comprise
      non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, pulsed oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide.
      Processed EEG parameters will be acquired with a BIS monitor, using surface electrodes, with
      impedance maintained at less than 5kΩ to ensure adequate signal quality. Raw EEG data from
      two channels (F7-CZ and F8-CZ) will be processed by company proprietary software and the BIS
      values (calculated for each 4-sec epoch) will be continuously displayed along with the trend
      line.

      Propofol will be infused using a commercially available TCI system loaded with Schneider's
      3-compartment pharmacokinetic model wherein the individual patient's age, height and weight
      will be programmed. The target effect-site concentration of propofol will be computed to
      yield a time to peak effect of 1.6 min, which has been confirmed clinically.

      During anaesthesia induction, the patients will breath an air-oxygen mixture through a face
      mask. The target effect-site concentration of propofol will first be set at 0.5 ng.ml-1 and
      it will be increased by 0.2 ng.ml-1 every 2 min until the clinical endpoint will be achieved
      (loss of consciousness and unresponsiveness). Then, ventilation will be assisted manually and
      the trachea will be intubated after the intravenous administration of fentanyl (100 mcg) and
      rocuronium (0.7 mg.kg-1).

      During anaesthesia maintenance, the effect-site concentration of propofol will be targeted to
      achieve BIS values between 30 and 60. Additional fentanyl, rocuronium or vasopressor agents
      (ephedrine) will be given at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist.

      Measurements When each patient will be comfortable on the operating table, baseline
      measurements of BIS, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulsed oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) will be taken.

      During propofol induction, BIS values, MAP, HR and SpO2 will be recorded every 1-min and the
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) rating scale will be recorded after each
      equilibration period (score 5=awake and responds readily to name spoken in normal tone; 4=
      lethargic response to name in normal tone; 3=response only after name is called loudly and/or
      repeatedly; 2= response only after name is called loudly and after mild shaking; 1= dose not
      respond when name is called and after mild shaking).

      During surgery and anaesthesia maintenance, BIS values and the effect-site concentration of
      propofol will be recorded each 5-min.

      Other recorded data will include the doses of propofol required for anaesthesia induction and
      maintenance, the total amount of vasopressor and the time until anaesthesia emergence and
      readiness for tracheal extubation.

      Statistics Assuming that MB pre-treatment would reduce the requirement of propofol by 25%,
      power analysis with alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.8, shows that we would need to study at least 10
      patients in each group. The computer program SAS 8.0 for Windows will be used for all data
      analyses. Parametric data will be analysed by two-way ANOVA. Unpaired Student t-tests,
      Chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact probability tests will be used as appropriate for
      comparison between groups. All values are expressed as mean (M), standard deviation (SD) and
      statistical significance will be accepted at p &lt; 0.05.
