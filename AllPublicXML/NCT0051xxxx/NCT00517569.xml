      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of GX-12 gene therapy combined with HAART
      in the HIV-1 infected patients and to investigate the efficacy with the value of plasma viral
      load and with CD4 counts and HIV-1 specific IFN-gamma expressed T-lymphocytes

    <textblock>
      Currently, management of HIV infection and AIDS is mainly done by antiviral chemotherapy
      which inhibits reverse transcriptase or proteolytic enzyme. The HAART (highly active
      antiretroviral therapy) has indeed succeeded extraordinary in decrease of the mortality and
      in increase of the life expediency of AIDS patients. However, there have been some
      significant limitations of them (for example, treatment fatigues, the side effects, the
      emergency of resistant, high medical costs, etc.).

      Recently, there has been a number of bioresearch for immunotherapy to overcome these
      limitations of current medications. GX-12 is a genetic using a naked DNA with human IL-12
      mutant as immune adjuvant. GX-12 is designed to vaccinate the individuals with HIV antigens,
      which is to result in enhancing the HIV specific immunity and to expand broadly the immune
      responses nonspecifically.

      In this study, the safety and efficacy of GX-12 will be investigated.
