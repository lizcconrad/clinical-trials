  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the recombinant human EGF-rP64K/Montanide
      ISA 51 vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in the treatment of stage IIIb/IV
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

          -  Patients with measurable lesions, defined as those measurable at least in one
             dimension (refered to higher diameter) and with a diameter equal or higher 20 mm using
             conventional techniques (PET, CT scan, MRI, Rx) or equal or higher 10 mm using CT
             scan.

          -  Patients who have finished their last cycle of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy not
             less than 4 weeks prior to randomization and not more than 8 weeks.

          -  ECOG status 0 to 2.

          -  Patients with normal organ and bone marrow function, as defined by the parameters in
             accordance to that provided by the normal lab reference range.

          -  Patients with no evidence of objective disease progression, 1 month after finishing
             first line chemotherapy as per RECIST.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who may be allergic to any component of the vaccine.

          -  Medical reasons considered by the investigators as disqualification from the study
             such as significant uncontrolled co-morbid disease or potential non-compliance with
             the protocol.

          -  Patients bearing brain metastasis from the primary lung tumor.

          -  Patients bearing a second primary tumor.

          -  Patients showing progressive disease after finishing first line chemotherapy.
