      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Xpert(TM)
      self-expanding stent in infrapopliteal lesions as part of an overall treatment strategy in
      patients undergoing percutaneous intervention for the treatment of documented chronic
      critical limb ischemia (CLI).

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities affects roughly 25 million
      Americans annually. The diabetic population is particularly prone to the most severe clinical
      problems associated with PAD and the amputation rate amongst such patients is elevated
      five-fold. It has been shown that patients who undergo amputation for PAD/CLI have a much
      higher mortality rate in the months that follow.

      Despite medical advances in the fields of pharmacology and wound care, the vast majority of
      patients who present with CLI will ultimately require amputation in the absence of improved
      blood flow. Recently, much attention has been directed towards less invasive endovascular
      solutions for treating patients with CLI. This study will evaluate approximately 140 subjects
      with Rutherford Class IV-VI PAD in a multi-center study in order to accurately estimate limb
      salvage rates for this treatment.
