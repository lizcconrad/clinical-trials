      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain substances to keep cancer from forming. The
      use of folic acid may prevent colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well folic acid works compared with a
      placebo in preventing colorectal polyps in patients who have had previous colorectal polyps.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if folic acid supplementation lowers the adenoma recurrence rate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the number of adenomas per patient and the size and histology of the adenoma.

        -  Assess the interaction between folic acid and alcohol, methionine, and aspirin intake.

        -  Assess the interaction between folic acid and pretrial and midtrial folate levels.

        -  Assess other complementary biomarkers such as DNA methylation and blood folate level as
           risk factors for polyp recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral folic acid once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. At least 1 year after beginning
           treatment, patients are sent a blood collection kit in order to measure plasma vitamin
           B12 levels, to measure folate to assess compliance.
