  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera plus high dose methotrexate plus
      high dose cytarabine in patients with central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eligible
      patients will receive a treatment regimen consisting of MabThera (750mg/m2 iv) plus
      methotrexate (8g/m2 iv) given at intervals up to week 22, plus cytarabine (2g/m2 iv) at week
      11 and week 22. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample
      size is &lt;100 individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or Unconfirmed CR (CRu)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>CR: complete disappearance of all enhancing abnormalities on contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); no evidence of active ocular lymphoma as defined by absence of cells in the vitreous and resolution of any previously documented retinal or optic nerve infiltrates; negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology; at the time of CR determination, participant had discontinued use of all corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks. CRu requires fulfillment of CR criteria but with these limitations: Fulfills CR criteria but had continued requirement for corticosteroid therapy at any dose; small but persistent enhancing abnormality on MRI related to biopsy or focal hemorrhage; persistent minor abnormality on follow-up ophthalmologic exam (related to persistent non-malignant cells in vitreous, or alterations in retina/optic nerve not consistent with tumor infiltration) if the abnormality is unlikely to represent ocular lymphoma.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a CR, CRu or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PR: greater than or equal to (≥) 50 percent (%) decrease in the contrast-enhancing lesion seen on MRI as compared with the baseline images; (2) Corticosteroid dose was irrelevant to the determination of PR; for participants with ocular disease, ophthalmologic exam must show a decrease in vitreous cell count or retina/optic nerve cellular infiltrate but may have continued to show persistent malignant or suspicious cells; for participants with CSF positive for neoplastic cells, CSF cytology may be negative or continue to show persistent malignant or suspicious cells in patients with ≥50% decrease in the primary brain lesions; no new sites of disease.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of last follow-up assessment between Day 1 and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time from entry into trial until death of any cause. Participants who were alive at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up assessment. Participants without follow-up assessment were censored at the day of last dose and participants with no post baseline information were censored at the baseline date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the entry into trial and occurrence of one of the following events: progression of disease (PD) or death as a result of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Participants who were withdrawn from the study without documented progression and for whom there existed case report form (CRF) evidence that evaluations had been made, were censored at the date of last tumor assessment when participant was known to be progression free. Participants without postbaseline tumor assessments but known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization. PD required a ≥25% increase in the contrast-enhanced lesion seen on MRI as compared with baseline or best response (comparison should be made to the smallest of multiple lesions); progression of ocular disease as indicated by an increase in vitreous cell count or progressive retinal or optic nerve infiltration, appearance of any new lesion or site of disease during or at the end of therapy.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the entry into trial and occurrence of one of the following events: progression of disease (PD) or death as a result of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Participants who were withdrawn from the study without documented progression and for whom there existed case report form (CRF) evidence that evaluations had been made, were censored at the date of last tumor assessment when participant was known to be progression free. Participants without postbaseline tumor assessments but known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization. PD required a ≥25% increase in the contrast-enhanced lesion seen on MRI as compared with baseline or best response (comparison should be made to the smallest of multiple lesions); progression of ocular disease as indicated by an increase in vitreous cell count or progressive retinal or optic nerve infiltration, appearance of any new lesion or site of disease during or at the end of therapy.</description>
