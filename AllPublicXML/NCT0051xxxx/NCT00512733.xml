  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dairy products continue to be an important source of calcium, providing over half the calcium
      intake for most individuals. Educational interventions promoting adequate calcium intake with
      tools estimating dietary calcium that can be easily utilized by consumers would be a valuable
      asset to promoting skeletal health. Validation of these tools against standard dietary
      assessment methods enhances their utility. The Dairy Council of California has developed two
      dietary calcium questionnaires, one electronic and one in print, using known dietary sources
      of calcium including frequency of consumption and portion size. For these questionnaires to
      be effective in clinical and research settings they must be a valid measurement of dietary
      calcium intake. To measure the validity of the dietary calcium questionnaires one hundred
      seventy three women will complete the two dietary calcium questionnaires and one 3-day food
      record. The dietary calcium questionnaires will be validated against this established method
      of dietary intake measurement. The objective of this study is to validate two dietary calcium
      questionnaires that can be used in clinical and research settings against an established
      method of dietary intake measurement. It is hypothesized that both dietary calcium
      questionnaires will be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake in women.

    <description>Participants' 3-day food records were mailed to the study and examined for completeness and legibility. Missing or unclear items were corrected by telephoning the participant. Food records were entered into Food Processor Plus software (ESHA Research, Salem, OR) to determine nutrient content. For food items that were not in the software's database, nutrient content was determined by examination of labels, contact with food manufacturers, search of the US Department of Agriculture nutrient database, or estimation from ingredient content by an RD.
At the initial study visit, participants completed a written questionnaire and the online questionnaire. Calcium intake was calculated using a built-in calculator in the online questionnaire and by hand using the instructions in the booklet for the written questionnaire.</description>
