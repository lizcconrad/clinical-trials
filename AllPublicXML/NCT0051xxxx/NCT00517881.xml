  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous
      methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (C.E.R.A.) for maintenance of hemoglobin levels in
      pre-dialysis participants with chronic renal anemia. Participants currently receiving
      maintenance treatment with subcutaneous darbepoetin alfa will receive monthly subcutaneous
      injections of C.E.R.A. with the starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms (mcg) derived
      from the dose of darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa in the week preceding study start.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Mean Hemoglobin Concentration Within Plus or Minus (+/-) 1 Gram Per Deciliter (g/dL) of Their Reference Hemoglobin and Within the Target Range</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 17 up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants maintaining the mean hemoglobin concentration within +/- 1.0 g/dL of their reference hemoglobin value and within the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL during the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) was reported. The reference hemoglobin value was defined as the mean of the 5 assessments recorded during the stability verification period (SVP) at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. The mean hemoglobin concentration for each individual participant during the EEP (Week 17 to Week 24) was estimated as a time adjusted average.</description>

    <description>The reference hemoglobin value was defined as the mean of the 5 assessments recorded during the SVP at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. The mean change of the time adjusted average of hemoglobin from reference value obtained during the SVP (Week -4 up to Week 0) and the value during EEP (Week 17 up to Week 24) was assessed.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants maintaining the mean hemoglobin concentration within +/- 1.0 g/dL of their reference hemoglobin value and within the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL during the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) was reported. The reference hemoglobin value was defined as the mean of the 5 assessments recorded during the stability verification period (SVP) at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. The mean hemoglobin concentration for each individual participant during the EEP (Week 17 to Week 24) was estimated as a time adjusted average.</description>
          <population>The Intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of C.E.R.A. (week 0) and for whom data for at least 1 follow-up variable was available. Data missing at the end of the EEP (that is, the last measured hemoglobin value before Week 24) was handled using the last value carried forward method.</population>
