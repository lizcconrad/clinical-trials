    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the correlation between plasma lanreotide levels
      and Growth Hormone (GH)/Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) dynamics and clinical
      improvement in patients with acromegaly treated with lanreotide Autogel (Somatuline ATG)
