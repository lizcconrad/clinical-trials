      The purpose of this study is:

      To investigate whether a treatment with quetiapine for six months in patients with
      first-episode psychosis may be effective in treating depressive symptoms.

      To investigate whether a treatment with quetiapine for six months in patients with
      first-episode psychosis may be effective in mania-like symptoms and to evaluate the general
      efficacy in psychopathology as well as the safety and tolerability of quetiapine.

      Affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms are prevalent in up to 60% of all
      patients with schizophrenia. However, it is still uncertain whether depressive symptoms have
      a prognostic value, having previously been associated with both favorable and poor outcome.
      In addition, treatment of affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia is difficult.
      There is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine may contribute not
      only to a reduction in psychotic symptoms but also that these agents may produce an
      antidepressant effect in schizophrenia and may reduce suicidality. Most of these studies
      suffer from methodological limitations as the efficacy on affective symptoms has not been the
      primary target parameter. Concerning the prevalence of affective symptoms in first-episode
      psychosis knowledge is still poor. This is why we have developed a study design for a
      pilot-study on 60 patients with first-episode schizophrenia aiming to demonstrate that a
      treatment with quetiapine over the period of 6 months shows clinical efficacy on affective,
      particularly depressive symptoms

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients who meet the following inclusion criteria are eligible to participate in the
        study:

          -  male and female patients with first-episode schizophrenia (based on ICD-10 criteria)

          -  in- and out-patients

          -  age between 18 and 45

          -  verbal IQ 85

          -  given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet one or more of the following exclusion criteria cannot participate in the
        study:

          -  Other Psychiatric disorders not in full remission, concomitant organic mental disorder
             or mental retardation

          -  Patients who, in the investigators judgement, pose an imminent risk of suicide or a
             danger to self or others

          -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&lt;7 points

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, lactating or at risk of pregnancy

          -  Female patients who are not using a highly effective method of birth control. A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as those which results in a low failure
             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             implantants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence
             or vasectomised partner. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method,
             information regarding the product under investigation and its potential effect on the
             contraception must be addressed.

          -  history of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, or condition that would predispose to
             (dehydration, hypovolaemia)

          -  Risk of transmitting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B and C, via
             blood or other body fluids

          -  history of non-compliance as judged by the investigator

          -  Patients with substance dependence. A urine drug screen will be performed. The
             investigator will evaluate the results along with medical history to determine if the
             patient meets the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence

          -  Patients with known diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, especially a
             patient with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) fulfilling one of the following criteria:

               -  unstable DM defined as enrollment glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)&gt;8.5%

               -  patients admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness in past
                  12 weeks

               -  patients not under physicians care for DM

               -  physicians responsible for patient´s DM care has not indicated that patient´s DM
                  is controlled

               -  physician responsible for patient´s DM care has not approved patient´s
                  participation in the study

               -  patient has not been on the same dose of oral hypoglycemic drug(s) and/or diet
                  for the 4 weeks prior to randomization. (For thiazolidinediones (glitazones) this
                  period should not be less than 8 weeks)

               -  patients taking insulin whose daily dose on one occasion in the past 4 weeks has
                  been more than 10% above or below their mean dose in the preceding 4 weeks.

        Note: If a diabetic patient meets one of these criteria, the patient is to be excluded even
        if the treating physician believes that the patient is stable and can participate in the
        study.

          -  ECG considered to show clinical significant abnormalities at enrolment as determined
             by a cardiologist

          -  Use of drugs that induce or inhibit the hepatic metabolizing cytochrome 3A4 enzyme
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization (e.g. inducers: phenytoin, carbamazepine,
             phenobarbital, rifampicin, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, thioridazine and St. Johns´wort
             (=Johanniskraut) and inhibitors: ketaconazole (except for topical use), itraconazole,
             fluconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, troleandomycin,
             indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir).

          -  patients with insufficient knowledge of the German language

          -  A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration more than 10% above the upper limit
             of the normal range and the laboratory used for sample analysis at enrolment, whether
             or not the subject is being treated for hypothyroidism

          -  Any serious and unstable somatic illness (e.g. malignant tumor, severe cardiovascular
             disease, etc.) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would be negatively affected
             by the study medication or that would affect study medication. If relevant medical
             findings are obtained during the examination, it is at the physician's discretion to
             initiate additional examinations (e.g. lab testing, ECG). If medically indicated
             examinations have already been carried out, the results should not be older than two
             weeks at the time of the screening visit. The patient can only participate in the
             study if all study results are within the normal range or the examiner has determined
             a deviation as clinically irrelevant. This should be clearly documented in the CRF.

          -  Participation in another drug trial within 4 weeks prior to enrolment into this study
             or longer in accordance with local requirements
