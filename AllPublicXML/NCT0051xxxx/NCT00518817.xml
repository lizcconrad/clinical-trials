      This study will have significant impact on muscular dystrophy patients as it promotes early
      screening for heart disease. With early identification, beneficial medical therapy can be
      started sooner, resulting in restoring and maintaining normal heart function. This is
      critical to the survival of these patients. We have reported previously that heart failure in
      all patients may have common mechanisms, the &quot;final common pathway&quot;. Heart failure is a
      significant health problem with 5 million people in the US carrying the diagnosis and
      accounting for 12-15 million office visits and 6.5 million hospital days per year. The number
      of deaths from heart failure continues to increase. The data from this study could impact
      patients worldwide with heart failure by offering new insight into an ever-growing disease
      population and lead to significant changes in how they are currently treated.

      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The objectives to be evaluated are as follows:

      Specific Hypothesis #1: Heart disease, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy, can be identified
      early in patients with muscular dystrophy and allow for earlier institution of medical
      therapies

      Specific Hypothesis #2: Non-invasive testing via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      echocardiography can identify early systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with
      muscular dystrophy as well as document structural changes (&quot;Reverse remodeling&quot;) following
      institution of medical therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #3: Serologic testing can identify early cardiac dysfunction prior to
      changes on magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiogram that can predict disease onset, risk
      stratify future cardiac morbidity and mortality, and response to medical therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #4: Specific dystrophin mutations can be identified that predict the
      onset or protection against dilated cardiomyopathy

      Specific Hypothesis #5: Construction and maintenance of a database of patients with muscular
      dystrophy can be established that will allow for future research in patients with muscular
      dystrophy, specifically in the area of gene therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #6: Quality of life in patients with cardiac disease can be assessed and
      used to modulate therapy and also allow for noncardiac directed therapies that will improve
      overall well-being

      Specific Hypothesis #7: Further understanding of neurohormonal profiles, responses to medical
      therapy, and dystrophin mediated cardiomyopathy will impact all patients with heart failure
      world-wide
