      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and
      leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and
      cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances
      to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with monoclonal antibody therapy works in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer
      with liver metastases or lung metastases that are potentially removable by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the pathological complete response (CR) rate in resected patients assessed
           on lesions of less than or equal to 30 mm in size.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the clinical CR rate in all patients.

        -  To determine toxicity and tolerability of this regimen (pre- and postoperative
           toxicity).

        -  To evaluate perioperative safety in these patients.

        -  To determine disease-free survival (time to progression in unresected patients) and
           overall survival of the whole study population.

        -  To determine resectability in these patients.

        -  To evaluate markers that predict the occurrence of a pathological CR or a non-response
           in pathological material (resected liver metastasis) and biological material collected
           from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 8 and 22,
      fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, leucovorin calcium IV on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 5
      weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who are able to undergo liver resection receive bevacizumab on day 1 only of course
      3 and undergo liver resection 3 weeks after chemotherapy. Beginning 4 weeks after liver
      resection, patients receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for biological
      studies. Samples are analyzed for markers that predict the occurrence of a complete
      pathological response (pCR) or a non-response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2
      years and then every 6 months thereafter.
