    <textblock>
      The Destiny trial compares the use of bare metal stent systems with drug eluting stent
      systems in the treatment of infrapopliteal lesions in patients with Critical Limb Ischemia.
      It will be investigated whether there is a difference in 12 month angiographic patency of the
      stented area using the 2 different stent systems.
