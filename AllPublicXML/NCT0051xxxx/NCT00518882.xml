  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this
      trial is to compare the effect on glycaemic control of liraglutide or exenatide when added to
      subject's ongoing OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment of either metformin, sulphonylurea
      or a combination of both in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Two trial periods: A 26 week
      randomised, followed by a 52 week extension (14 + 38 weeks) where all subjects received
      liraglutide + OAD after previous randomisation to either liraglutide or exenatide, both
      combined with OAD treatment.
