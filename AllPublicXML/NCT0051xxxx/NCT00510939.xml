      This is one of the first studies of combination of Zarnestra plus Velcade in man. A primary
      objective of the study is therefore to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses
      of Zarnestra plus Velcade in patients with AML.

      New treatments for patients that are untreatable with intensive chemotherapy aged de novo AML
      patients or post-relapse AML are urgently required since, at present, many of the drugs used
      for second line therapy are the same as those used for first induction and response rates are
      much lower.

        -  The following evidence suggests that Velcade plus Zarnestra can be an attractive
           therapeutic combination for: AML patients.

        -  Affymetrix gene profiling data showed expression of NFkB1 in all of 5 myeloid cell lines
           cell lines tested and 35% of over 250 patient samples ( data generated in collaboration
           with Sergio Ferrari and Pier Paolo Piccaluga unpublished results, our Institute and
           University of Modena,Italy)

        -  Preclinical evidence showed that AML cells in suspension culture were prevented to
           develop de novo drug resistance and mediated drug resistance.

      In Part B additional patients with AML will be treated to further characterize the
      tolerability,biological effects, and clinical efficacy of the combination Velcade plus
      Zarnestra. Patients on treatment for AML will undergo regular bone marrow aspirates and
      biopsies to assess responses to treatment. This will facilitate frequent assessment of
      biological endpoints (reduction in expression and phosphorylation of IKKb kinase, and
      downstream markers of signalling along with apoptosis, survival, proliferation and cellular
      size and ploidy) will be made in an attempt to confirm that the desired biological activity
      has been achieved at the maximum tolerated dose.
