  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed is an FDA-approved treatment for advanced lung cancer but the response rate is
      still very low. Bortezomib is currently approved to treat myeloma in patients who have
      already been treated. Currently, multiple studies are actively investigating how well
      bortezomib works with other drugs. This study is testing how much bortezomib can be given to
      advanced lung cancer patients who have already received one treatment. This study will also
      see how well bortezomib and pemetrexed work together to treat lung cancer patients.
