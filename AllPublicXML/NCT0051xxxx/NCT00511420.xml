      Studies carried out during the last decades have demonstrated of conclusive form that foods
      like nuts, products like cocoa or other ingredients, to be consumed of isolated form or when
      taking several from integrated them in a same diet can contribute to the prevention or the
      treatment of the cardiovascular diseases.

      The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel multi-center study in which
      the 4 different types of cocoa products [1)cocoa and other ingredients (sugar and vegetal
      oils), 2)cocoa plus hazelnuts and other ingredients, 3)the same as 2 plus other ingredient
      and 4) cocoa, hazelnuts and other ingredients called (LMN)], introduced into a
      calorie-balanced diet for 4 weeks with a prior stabilization period of 2 weeks in which all
      participants received the cocoa product type 1. Cocoa product type 1 is a control of type 2,
      and types 1 and 2 were controls of types 3 and 4.

      Cocoa products type 4 is registered as patent. The trial was conducted in Reus and 3 other
      cities in Catalonia (Alcover, Centelles and Vic) (Spain).
