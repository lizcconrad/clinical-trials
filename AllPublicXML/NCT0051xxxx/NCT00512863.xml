        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of refractory asthma, as defined by the American Thoracic
             Society,31 defined as 1 major and at least 2 minor criteria

          -  Actual or documented history of reversible airway obstruction

          -  Baseline FEV1 of 40% − 80% of the predicted for height, age, and sex at Screening, as
             demonstrated 6 or more hours after a short-acting -agonist and/or 24 or more hours
             after a long-acting -agonist

          -  History of at least 1 asthma exacerbation leading to oral, IV or IM corticosteroid or

             Screening. This asthma exacerbation should not have been within 30 days prior to
             Screening

          -  Adequate cardiac, renal and hepatic function as determined by the principal
             investigator and demonstrated by Screening laboratory evaluations, questionnaires, and
             physical examination results that are within normal limits

          -  Subjects must be able to self-inject study medication or have a designee or healthcare
             professional who can inject the study medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment for corticosteroid-resistant asthma (e.g., methotrexate [MTX],
             cyclosporine, gold salts, troleandomycin, immune globulin intravenous [IGIV],
             mycophenolate mofetil)

          -  History of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease other than a successfully and
             completely treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma −
             in-situ of the cervix.

          -  History of listeria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic or active Hepatitis

          -  Females who are pregnant or will not discontinue breast-feeding.

          -  Subject with a history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the last
             year

          -  Subjects with a poorly controlled medical condition.

          -  Abnormal, clinically significant screening laboratory and other analyses (including
             ECG).

          -  Subjects with any prior exposure to Tysabri® (natalizumab)
