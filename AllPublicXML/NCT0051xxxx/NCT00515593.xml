      The objectives of the study are

        -  to describe the quality of life at the beginning of the Preotact® treatment and at the
           end of the observational period (Qualeffo-41 questionnaire)

        -  pain assessment at the beginning of the Preotact® treatment and at the end of the
           observational period (VAS score)

        -  to describe bone mineral density at the beginning of the Preotact® treatment and at the
           end of the observational period (T-Score)

        -  to describe incidence of bone fractures caused by osteoporosis as well as of other
           pathological findings of the skeleton after the beginning of the Preotact® treatment

        -  to describe serum level of calcium and the bone resorption marker desoxypyridinoline
           (DPD) and N- respectively C-terminal crosslink-telopeptide (CTX and NTX) at the
           beginning of the Preotact® treatment and at the end of the observational period (only in
           subgroup of patients, where the physician sees a need to measure these parameters)

        -  to document all adverse drug reactions after the beginning of the Preotact® treatment

        -  the analysis of subgroups with different risk for bone fractures caused by osteoporosis
           at the beginning of the Preotact® treatment

        -  to assess the manageability and functioning of the Pen system for injection of Preotact®
           (self administered questionnaire)
