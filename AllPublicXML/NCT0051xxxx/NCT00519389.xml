        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18 to 40 years of age at the time of the vaccination.

          2. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g., return for follow-up visits and completion of the data collection
             tool).

          3. Available by telephone.

          4. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering the study.

          5. If subject is of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate
             contraceptive precautions (e.g., intrauterine contraceptive device; oral
             contraceptives or other equivalent hormonal contraception) for 30 days prior to
             vaccination. She must also have a negative pregnancy test at study entry and must
             agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of vaccination.

          6. Must provide written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the

             planned use during the study period.

          2. Has received any other licensed vaccines within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this
             study.

          3. Has received any influenza vaccine within the prior 12 month period.

          4. Has received any investigational vaccine designed for protection against avian

          5. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the administration of the study
             vaccine. The use of inhaled and nasal steroids will be permitted.

          6. Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition based on medical
             history and physical examination.

          7. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          8. Acute disease at the time of enrollment. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness with or without fever ≥ 100.5º F.

          9. Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional
             abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

         10. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

         11. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, with the exception of febrile
             seizures during childhood.
