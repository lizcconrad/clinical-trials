  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diffuse lung disease, associated with the
      histological appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), with an inexorably
      deteriorating clinical course. Prognosis is poor, reported median survival is less than 3
      years. The prevalence is estimated as being 3 to 10 per 100.000 in different Western
      populations. To date, no pharmacological therapy has been proven to alter or reverse the
      pathogenic process of IPF. Most treatments trials have been observational case series of
      small patient populations and very few have been randomized, prospective and
      placebo-controlled.

      Two recent Cochrane reviews investigated the role of corticosteroids and other
      immunomodulatory agents and concluded that there is no evidence for their use in IPF. Most
      current therapies are targeted to suppress the inflammatory component of the disease, based
      on the theory that it would be chronic alveolar inflammation which leads to parenchymal
      remodeling and fibrosis. Recently, a hypothesis that has gained acceptance suggests that
      fibrosis may result directly from alveolar injury, promoting an abnormal fibrogenic repair
      mediated by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.

      One of the cytotoxic agents most widely used and better tolerated in the management of IPF is
      azathioprine. Based upon limited data available and from a single small high quality
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), this drug appears to confer, given in conjunction with
      prednisone, a marginal long term survival advantage. Since this combination therapy is
      associated serious adverse effect, we planned to design a trial of low dose corticosteroid
      and azathioprine versus placebo in management of IPF, evaluating progression-free survival.

      Our study hypothesis is: Combined therapy with azathioprine and corticosteroids improves
      progression-free survival in patients with the diagnosis of IPF.

      pattern of UIP, will be selected to the randomization process, after they have signed the
      written informed consent.
