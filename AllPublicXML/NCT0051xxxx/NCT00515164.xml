      Background:

      Patients with emphysema currently have limited treatment choices. Many patients are treated
      with steroids and inhaled medications, which often provide little or no benefit. In recent
      years, lung volume reduction surgery has become an accepted therapy for advanced emphysema.
      Lung volume reduction surgery involves the removal of diseased portions of the lung in order
      to enable the remaining, healthier portions of the lung to function better. This procedure,
      although effective for many patients, is complicated and is accompanied by substantial
      morbidity and mortality risk.

      Aeris Therapeutics has developed the Biologic Lung Volume Reduction (BLVR) System which is
      intended to achieve lung volume reduction without surgery and its attendant risks. Patients
      are treated using a bronchoscope to direct treatment to the most damaged areas of the lung.
      The treatment delivers a precisely proportioned proprietary mixture of drugs and biologics
      which, when combined at the treatment site, form a biodegradable hydrogel. The hydrogel acts
      to reduce lung volume by permanently collapsing and sealing the diseased areas of the lung.
      This provides room within the chest to allow the remaining healthier portions of the lung to
      function better.

      Aeris' BLVR development program has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA, and
      is the subject of ongoing clinical trials designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      the BLVR System as a treatment for patients with advanced heterogeneous emphysema. Fast Track
      designation is reserved for drug and biologic development programs that are intended to treat
      serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet
      medical needs.
