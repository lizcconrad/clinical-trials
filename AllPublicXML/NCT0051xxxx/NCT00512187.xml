  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is to investigate whether a moderate weight loss (i.e. a weight
      reduction of at least 5%) could improve the response rate to a suboptimal dose of
      cyclosporine in patients with severe psoriasis.

    <description>Low calorie diet was designed to achieve a loss of 5-10% of initial weight. All enrolled patients received a balanced diet scheme, based on a caloric intake reduction related to BMI and sex (range 1200-1500 Kcal/day for women, 1300-1600 Kcal/day for men). Calorie intake consisted approximately of 60% carbohydrates, 25% fat, 15% protein</description>
