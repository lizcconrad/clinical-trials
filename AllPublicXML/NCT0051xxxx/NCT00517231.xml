  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a highly prevalent chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis. Cytokines are important biological mediators that regulate immune and
      inflammatory responses against the bacilli, witch include the acute phase response. Besides
      this, it becomes essential to determine markers of healing lesions, once this is currently
      carried out based on the clinical, radiological, and negative bacterioscopy.

      Tuberculosis is a highly prevalent chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis. Cytokines are important biological mediators that regulate immune and
      inflammatory responses against the bacilli, witch include the acute phase response. Besides
      this, it becomes essential to determine markers of healing lesions, once this is currently
      carried out based on the clinical, radiological, and negative bacterioscopy. The propose of
      this work was to evaluate the production of IFN- γ in cell supernatants of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture, TNF-α, IL-10 and TGF-b in cell supernatants of monocytes
      (MO) culture and biochemical (total proteins, albumin, globulin, α-1-acid glycoprotein and
      C-reactive protein) and hematological (VHS) serum parameters before and after 3 and 6 months
      of therapy
