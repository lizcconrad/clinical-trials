      This research study is being done to evaluate the use of an oral (by mouth) medication called
      tinidazole to initially treat BV and then to see if additional treatment with tinidazole
      keeps women from getting this infection back within 3 months. Tinidazole is currently
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat bacterial vaginosis
      (BV).

      This study will evaluate the use of tinidazole to treat a woman's current BV infection and
      then will look at using tinidazole as a suppressive treatment (taking medication regularly to
      attempt to decrease the &quot;bad&quot; bacteria from growing back). The suppressive treatment phase
      will include using tinidazole twice a week compared to using placebo twice a week and then
      following women for recurrence of BV. The purpose of this study is to determine if tinidazole
      suppression will prevent BV from coming back within 3 months of treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that women with a history of recurrent bacterial vaginosis who
      are randomized to a suppressive regimen (a dose of medication given on a regular basis to
      attempt to control the bacteria that causes bacterial vaginosis) of tinidazole will have
      lower recurrence rates and a longer time to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis when compared
      to those women randomized to placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-45 at time of enrollment.

          2. Recurrent BV as defined by:

               -  2 previously documented diagnoses of BV in the past 6 months or

               -  3 previously documented diagnoses of BV in the past year

          3. Non-pregnant, non-lactating.

          4. Premenopausal.

          5. Presence of bacterial vaginosis at the enrollment visit using Amsel Criteria (at least
             3 of 4):

               -  Presence of homogenous vaginal discharge

               -  pH of vaginal secretions of &gt; 4.7

               -  Presence of a positive &quot;whiff&quot; test of the vaginal secretions upon mixing with
                  10% KOH

               -  Presence of &gt; 20% clue cells on saline microscopy

          6. Willingness to undergo randomization to a possible placebo arm (for suppressive
             therapy).

          7. Ability to undergo informed consent.

          8. Willingness to refrain from use of any intravaginal products (including douching,
             contraceptive spermicides, creams, gels, foams).

          9. Currently using an acceptable method of birth control (such as a hormonal method
             including oral contraceptives, Depo Provera, Ortho Evra, abstinence x 60 days,
             consistent condom use, surgically sterile, lesbian orientation).

         10. Willing to refrain from alcohol consumption during use of study medication and three
             days following completion of medication (which includes the 10 day open label
