  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess contraceptive efficacy, vaginal bleeding
      patterns (cycle control), general safety and acceptability of the nomegestrol
      acetate-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) combined oral contraceptive (COC) in a large group of women aged
      18-50 years.

    <measure>Number of In-treatment Pregnancies (With +2 Day Window) Per 100 Woman Years of Exposure (Pearl Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year (13 cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>In-treatment pregnancies were pregnancies with an estimated date of conception from the day of first intake of trial medication up to and including the day of last (active or placebo) intake of trial medication extended with a maximum of two days. Each 13 cycles (28 days per cycle) of exposure constitutes a woman year. The Pearl Index was obtained by dividing the number of in-treatment pregnancies that occurred by the time (in 100 women years) that the women were under risk of becoming pregnant.</description>

    <description>In-treatment pregnancies were pregnancies with an estimated date of conception from the day of first intake of trial medication up to and including the day of last (active or placebo) intake of trial medication extended with a period of 14 days. Each 13 cycles (28 days per cycle) of exposure constitutes a woman year. The Pearl Index was obtained by dividing the number of in-treatment pregnancies that occurred by the time (in 100 women years) that the women were under risk of becoming pregnant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 13 cycles (one year total)</time_frame>
    <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding/spotting was defined as any episode that occurred during the &quot;expected non-bleeding period&quot; that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Expected non-bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 21-day period starting on Day 1 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 21-day period starting on Day 4 of the cycle.</description>

    <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Absence of withdrawal bleeding was defined as no bleeding/spotting episode that began during or continued into the &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding/spotting was defined as any episode that occurred during the &quot;expected non-bleeding period&quot; that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Expected non-bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 21-day period starting on Day 1 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 21-day period starting on Day 4 of the cycle.</description>

        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Absence of Withdrawal Bleeding</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Absence of withdrawal bleeding was defined as no bleeding/spotting episode that began during or continued into the &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 13 cycles (one year total)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Breakthrough Bleeding</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding was defined as any bleeding episode that occurred during the &quot;expected non-bleeding period&quot; that was neither part of an early nor continued withdrawal bleeding. Expected non-bleeding period: LNG-EE group: 21-day period starting on Day 1 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 21-day period starting on Day 4 of the cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 13 cycles (one year total)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

Early withdrawal bleeding was defined as any withdrawal bleeding that started before the current &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle.</description>

        <title>Average Number of Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting Days</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding/spotting was defined as any episode that occurred during the &quot;expected non-bleeding period&quot; that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Expected non-bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 21-day period starting on Day 1 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 21-day period starting on Day 4 of the cycle.</description>

        <population>ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <title>Average Number of Withdrawal Bleeding/Spotting Days</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using e-diaries. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Withdrawal bleeding was defined as bleeding/spotting episode that started during or continued into the &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: DRSP-EE group: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle; NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle.</description>

        <population>ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.
