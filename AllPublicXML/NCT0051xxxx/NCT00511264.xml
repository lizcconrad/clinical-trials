  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic Ultrasound (LUS) is an important part of the pre-treatment evaluation of
      patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and liver
      cancer). When a suspect lesion is visualized during LUS a biopsy should be provided in order
      to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. A new system for LUS guided biopsy has
      been developed, but how often these biopsies are clinically relevant (i.e. changing patient
      management)and how reliable are these biopsies are unknown.

      The study hypothesis is that LUS guided biopsies are accurate and clinically relevant in the
      pre-treatment evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer.
