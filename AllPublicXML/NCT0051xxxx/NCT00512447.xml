      New technology allows non-invasive monitoring of brain oxygenation
      (Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy). However, there are no large series of normal values in various
      adult age groups. We hypothesised that baseline values in patients breathing room air are
      lower in old patients than in younger subjects and that younger patients respond increase
      their brain oxygenation more in response to supplemental oxygen.
