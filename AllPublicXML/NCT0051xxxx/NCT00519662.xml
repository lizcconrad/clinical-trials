    <description>Sequential groups, starting at a dose of 30 mg/m2, will be escalated according to identification of dose limiting toxicities against various criteria. Doses escalated by doubling the dose until the first observation of clinically significant Grade 2 or greater toxicity related to SNS-314 injection. Results in dosing increments of 67%, 50%, 40%, 33%, and subsequently 25% based on modified Fibonacci schema.</description>
