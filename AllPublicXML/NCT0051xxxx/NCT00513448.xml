  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a group wellness intervention or
      individualized physical rehabilitation was more effective in improving health and physical
      activity in persons with multiple sclerosis.

      Evidence from this study shows that both interventions were effective in improving health and
      physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis. The results also show that participants
      may benefit more physically from individualized physical rehabilitation and more mentally
      from group wellness interventions. Interventions that combine individualized therapeutic
      exercise with group health education might be most effective for persons with multiple
      sclerosis.
