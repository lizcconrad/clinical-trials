    <textblock>
      Primary objective to evaluate the effect of a 12-week treatment period with prandial
      administration of Technosphere Insulin on glucose control in subjects with T2 DM. Secondary
      objective is to Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 12-week treatment period of
      Technosphere Insulin and Technosphere Placebo.
