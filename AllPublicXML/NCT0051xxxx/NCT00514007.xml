      Tolerated Dose (MTD) on both Once Daily (QD) and Twice Daily (BID) schedules.

      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation. The study will open with the QD
      schedule, with initiation of the BID schedule occurring after observation of clinically
      significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in the QD schedule.

      Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with daily dosing (either QD or BID) continuing for 21
      days.

      Once the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined for the BID schedule, 2 expansion
      cohorts will be opened: 1) Biomarker Expansion Cohort in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic colorectal cancer and 2) Diabetic Expansion Cohort in patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have active Type 2 diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin or insulinotropic
      therapy.

      This study is currently only recruiting to the Biomarker and Diabetic Expansion Cohorts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented malignancy that is now advanced and/or
             metastatic and refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective
             therapy exists. Patients in the Biomarker Expansion Cohort must have histologically
             documented colorectal cancer that is locally advanced or metastatic and refractory to
             established forms of therapy. These patients must have archival tissue available and a
             lesion accessible for biopsy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-2, life expectancy
             ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Prior chemotherapy is permitted provided that a minimum of 3 weeks has elapsed. Prior
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is permitted. Patients must have recovered from any
             treatment-related toxicities (with some exceptions) prior to registration

          -  Prior hormonal therapy is permitted provided it is discontinued prior to registration
             (with the exception of prostate cancer patients who have been on hormone therapy for
             at least 3 months)

          -  Prior radiation therapy is permitted provided that patients have recovered from the
             toxic effects. A minimum of 21 days must have elapsed unless the radiotherapy was
             palliative and nonmyelosuppressive

          -  Prior surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred prior to
             registration

          -  Fasting glucose ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) at baseline (all patients except those in the
             Diabetic Expansion Cohort). Patients in the Diabetic Expansion Cohort must have a
             fasting glucose of ≤ 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) at baseline. If patients in the Diabetic
             Expansion Cohort are being treated with non-insulinotropic oral antihyperglycemic
             therapy, doses must be stable for ≥ 4 weeks prior to registration
