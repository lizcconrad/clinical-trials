  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of risperidone treatment in acute
      psychotic patients that require an admission into emergency department. The effectiveness of
      risperidone in controlling acute psychotic symptomatology and incidence, severity and risk of
      psychomotor agitation in acute psychotic patients was also studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic drugs are key treatment for the acute psychotic symptoms experienced by
      schizophrenic, schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder patients. In the last
      years, atypical antipsychotics having fewer side effects than conventional neuroleptics, have
      been introduced into clinical practice. There is not an agreement about what type of drugs
      should be used in an emergency situation (acute psychotic patient). The aim of this
      observational, prospective study was to evaluate the impact of a treatment regimen with the
      atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, as first line treatment in acute psychotic patients
      that requested an admission into the hospital. Effectiveness of risperidone treatment was
      measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) agitation sub scale, Brief Psychotic
      Rating Scale and days of in-patient period. Aggressive behavior was rated using Staff
      Observation Aggression Scale (SOAS) and Visual Analogic Scale for agitation and anxiety.
      Safety was evaluated collecting elicited adverse events. Observational study - Risperidone,
      3-6 mg per day, orally, during the study period (in-patient period for each patient).
