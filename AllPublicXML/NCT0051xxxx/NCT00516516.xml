  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle cramps occur frequently among pregnant women, and few therapeutic options exist. This
      is a study of oral L-carnitine, a dietary supplement, for the treatment of muscle cramps in
      pregnancy. Our hypothesis is that carnitine will alleviate or eliminate muscle cramps
      experienced by pregnant women.

      Muscle cramps occur frequently among pregnant women, and few therapeutic options exist. This
      is a study of oral L-carnitine, a dietary supplement, for the treatment of muscle cramps in
      pregnancy. The conceptual basis for this study comes from the fact that carnitine has been
      used effectively in multiple randomized trials for the treatment of muscle cramps in other
      carnitine deficient states (such as hemodialysis). In pregnancy, women have decreased serum
      carnitine concentrations (from decreased intake, increased clearance by the kidney, and
      increased demands from the fetus). Thus, our hypothesis is that carnitine will alleviate or
      eliminate muscle cramps experienced by pregnant women.
