    <textblock>
      Bleeding peptic ulcers are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality for hospital
      emergency admissions.The initial treatment is endoscopic therapy followed by intravenous
      omeprazole. However the optimal dosage of omeprazole is not known. We conducted this study to
      find out the optimal dosage in such clinical scenario.

      Introduction

      Peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) is a common and life threatening condition. Intravenous infusion
      of high dose omeprazole (80mg as bolus followed by 8 mg/hr for 72 hours ie 652 mg/72 hrs)
      after endoscopic therapy resulted in greater reductions of re-bleeding than did placebo. Thus
      the above regime became our departmental protocol. However, there is some evidence that both
      high dose and a regular dose of omeprazole (40mg once a day followed by a saline infusion ie
      120mg/72 hrs) would be equally effective. We calculated that high dose regimen is about S$
      500 more expensive. The aim of our study is to determine the equivalence of both regimes in
      preventing re-bleeding rate (primary end-point), surgery and mortality in PUB patients.

      Study design This is a single institution prospective randomized double-blind study. All
      patient with PUB (Forrest classification I, IIa and IIb: spurting or oozing bleeding, visible
      vessels and clot) had endoscopic treatments (adrenaline injection and/or heater probe). After
      successful endoscopic hemostasis, patients are randomized to receive a high or regular dose
      of omeprazole infusion. After 72 hours, both groups of patients are given oral omeprazole
      40mg daily for 4 weeks. All patients are evaluated at the clinic at the end of 4 weeks. The
      primary end-point is rebleeding. Other secondary endpoints measured are surgery, duration of
      hospital stay and death.
