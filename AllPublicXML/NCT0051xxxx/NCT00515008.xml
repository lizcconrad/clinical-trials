    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the effects of Tai Chi on
      musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep quality, psychological distress, physical
      performance,and health status in 60 patients with fibromyalgia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common, complex chronic condition marked by diffuse musculoskeletal
      pain, fatigue, functional impairment, disability, and psychological distress that affects
      6-10 million people in the United States (US). There are currently no satisfactory
      pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for FM. New cost-effective strategies that
      reduce musculoskeletal pain and improve emotional and physical functioning as well as quality
      of life in people with FM are urgently needed.

      Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that
      appears to benefit a variety of chronic conditions. The physical component provides exercise
      that is consistent with that recommended for FM (muscle conditioning and aerobic
      cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to improve
      psychological well-being. These effects are especially pertinent for the treatment of
      individuals with FM.

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi for fibromyalgia. We plan to enroll 60
      patients with fibromyalgia over a two year period. Participants are randomized to either a
      Tai Chi program or an attention control intervention. Assessments are performed at baseline,
      week 12 and week 24. This study will provide preliminary data on the potential acceptability
      and safety of Tai Chi for FM and will help guide the design of a future large-scale study of
      the efficacy of this alternative therapy.

    <description>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a well-validated, multidimensional measure of the overall severity of fibromyalgia as rated by patients. Categories include the intensity of pain, physical functioning, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, depression, anxiety, job difficulty, and overall well-being.21 The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The tai chi intervention took place twice a week for 12 weeks, and each session lasted for 60 minutes. Classes were taught by a tai chi master with more than 20 years of teaching experience. In the first session, he explained the theory behind tai chi and its procedures and provided participants with printed materials on its principles and techniques. In subsequent sessions, participants practiced 10 forms from the classic Yang style of tai chi 18 under his instruction. Each session included a warm-up and self-massage, followed by a review of principles, movements, breathing techniques, and relaxation in tai chi. Throughout the intervention period, participants were instructed to practice tai chi at home for at least 20 minutes each day. At the end of the 12-week intervention, participants were encouraged to maintain their tai chi practice, using an instructional DVD, up until the follow-up visit at 24 weeks.</description>

Stretches involved the upper body, trunk, and lower body and were held for 15 to 20 seconds. Participants were instructed to practice stretching at home for 20 minutes a day.</description>

            <description>The tai chi intervention took place twice a week for 12 weeks, and each session lasted for 60 min- utes. Classes were taught by a tai chi master with more than 20 years of teaching experience. In the first session, he explained the theory behind tai
chi and its procedures and provided participants with printed materials on its principles and tech- niques. In subsequent sessions, participants prac- ticed 10 forms from the classic Yang style of tai chi18 under his instruction. Each session included a warm-up and self-massage, followed by a review of principles, movements, breathing techniques, and relaxation in tai chi. Throughout the inter- vention period, participants were instructed to practice tai chi at home for at least 20 minutes each day. At the end of the 12-week intervention, participants were encouraged to maintain their tai chi practice, using an instructional DVD, up until the follow-up visit at 24 weeks.</description>
