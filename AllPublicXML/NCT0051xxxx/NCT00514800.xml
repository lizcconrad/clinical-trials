    <textblock>
      Design: Community based randomised trial with follow up after 12 months Participants: 360
      patients admitted with stroke or TIA within the past 9 months will be recruited from the
      wards or outpatients and randomly allocated into two groups. All patients will be visited by
      the specialist nurse at home at baseline when she will measure their BP and administer a
      questionnaire. The questionnaire and BP will be repeated at 12 months follow-up by another
      researcher blind as to whether the patient is in intervention or control group.

      Intervention: Intervention patients will be given a validated home BP monitor and support
      from the specialist nurse. Control patients will continue with usual care (BP monitoring by
      their practice).

      Main outcome measures in both groups after 12months: 1.Change in systolic BP 2.Cost
      effectiveness: Incremental cost of the intervention to the NHS and incremental cost per
      quality adjusted life year gained.

      Study hypothesis. Home blood pressure monitoring with nurse support wil lead to lower blood
      pressure after 12 months compared with usual GP care

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure in patients with stroke increases the risk of recurrence but management
      in the community is often inadequate. Home blood pressure monitoring may increase patients'
      involvement in their care, increase compliance, and reduce the need for patients to attend
      their GP if blood pressure is adequately controlled. However the value of home monitoring to
      improve BP control is unclear and there is now a window of opportunity for evaluation before
      their use becomes widespread in the UK. Furthermore its use in stroke patients presents
      unique challenges relating to the consequent neurological disability.

    <description>Patients will be given a home blood pressure monitor and taught how to use it and how to respond to the readings using a standardised protocol and blood pressure targets. The study nurse will follow up patients at home after a month with additional telephone support according to a defined protocol. Patients will consult their own GP for medication changes when above target.
GPs will be sent information about the study design, current guidelines and interpretation of home blood pressure readings.</description>
