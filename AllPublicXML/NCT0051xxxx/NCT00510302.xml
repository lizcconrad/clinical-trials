      Primary Objectives:

        -  To conduct semi-structured interviews with melanoma patients and family members to
           collect descriptive information on their UVR exposure, UVR exposure-reduction practices,
           melanoma early detection practices, knowledge, psychosocial variables related to
           melanoma risk-reduction (e.g., self-efficacy, norms, and expectations), and experiences
           surrounding the diagnosis of melanoma in the family. Melanoma patients and family
           members with children will be asked about the UVR exposure and UVR exposure-reduction
           practices of their children, and parental practices to reduce UVR exposure among
           children.

        -  To develop behavioral and attitudinal questionnaires based on data collected during
           semi-structured interviews, and evaluate the appropriateness of these questionnaires
           using cognitive interviewing techniques.

        -  To develop tailored messages aimed at promoting strategies to reduce UVR exposure (e.g.,
           wearing protective clothing, minimizing midday UVR exposure, minimizing duration of UVR
           exposure, using shade and sunscreen, avoiding sun lamps, and avoiding intentional
           tanning) and improving adherence to surveillance and screening guidelines. Messages will
           be developed to correspond to responses to questionnaire items.

        -  To assess tailored messages for their relevance, appropriateness, attractiveness and
           appeal, credibility, and perceived behavioral impact among melanoma patients and their
           family members.

      Participants in Part 1 of the study will be asked to be interviewed about topics related to
      melanoma risk-reduction, including opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to
      ultraviolet radiation exposure, melanoma prevention, and melanoma detection.

      Participants in Part 2 of the study will be asked to complete a written questionnaire on
      melanoma risk-reduction and then be interviewed to obtain feedback on how the questionnaire
      may be refined.

      Participants in Part 3 of the study will be asked to be interviewed by telephone.
      Participants then will receive educational material in the form of a newsletter tailored to
      their interview responses. Participants then will be asked to be interviewed to obtain
      feedback for refining the educational material. In each part of the study, the patient/family
      member will receive a letter describing the study and the Consent Statement for Questionnaire
      and Interview Studies.

      Prior to the start of the interview, the Consent Statement will be read to the patient/family
      member. Patients/family members may or may not choose to have the interview tape-recorded.
      Participants may stop the interview or questionnaire at any time and may refuse to answer any
      questions. At any time, the patient/family member may refuse to have the interview
      tape-recorded. There is no treatment associated with this study.
