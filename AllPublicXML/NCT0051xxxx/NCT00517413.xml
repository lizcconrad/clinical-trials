  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Mircera when administered once
      monthly, subcutaneously or intravenously, for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in
      dialysis patients with chronic renal anemia. Patients currently receiving maintenance
      treatment with epoetin alfa will receive monthly injections of Mircera with a starting dose
      (120, 200 or 360 micrograms) derived from the dose of epoetin alfa they were receiving in the
      week preceding study start. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the
      target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Their Mean Hb Concentration Within Â±1.0 Gram/Deciliter of Their Reference Hb and Between 10.5 and 12.5 Gram/Deciliter</measure>
    <time_frame>EEP (Week 16 to 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The haemoglobin (Hb) levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. The reference Hb value was defined on the basis of individual participant's all assessments at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. The Hb value on the first day of first dose (Week 0) was included in the calculation, as this assessment was performed before the first dose was given. The percentage of participants maintaining their mean Hb concentration within +/-1.0 gram/deciliter (g/dL) of their reference Hb and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL are reported for efficacy evaluation period (EEP). Efficacy evaluation period was from Week 16 to Week 24 after completion of 16-week dose titration period (DTP).</description>

    <measure>Mean Transferrin Saturation Levels Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a blood protein that picks up iron absorbed by the intestines and transports it from one location to another. When iron absorption is abnormally high, transferrin proteins become more saturated with iron. An elevated TS value therefore reflects an increase in iron absorption. The TSAT levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. TSAT was calculated automatically in the electronic case report form (eCRF) according to the following formulae: TSAT= (Serum Iron*100)/(Transferrin*1.41) or TSAT=(Serum Iron*100)/TIBC. Calculated data was not provided by laboratory; therefore no reference range is available.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so that the body can use it later. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood. The Ferritin levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48.

          <description>Participants with chronic renal anaemia who were on dialysis and previously treated with intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa received monthly treatment with Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.)

        <description>The haemoglobin (Hb) levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. The reference Hb value was defined on the basis of individual participantâs all assessments at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. The Hb value on the first day of first dose (Week 0) was included in the calculation, as this assessment was performed before the first dose was given. The percentage of participants maintaining their mean Hb concentration within +/-1.0 gram/deciliter (g/dL) of their reference Hb and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL are reported for efficacy evaluation period (EEP). Efficacy evaluation period was from Week 16 to Week 24 after completion of 16-week dose titration period (DTP).</description>

The standard reference range for Hb are as follows: Female: min-max for lower limit=11 to 13 g/dL and min-max for upper limit=14 to 18.1 g/dL; Male: min-max for lower limit=12 to 14.2 g/dL and min-max for upper limit=16 to 18.1 g/dL.</description>
          <population>The safety population included all participants who entered into the study. n = the number of participants analyzed at a given time point.</population>

        <description>The creatinine, iron, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. The standard reference ranges for creatinine are as follows: Female: min-max for lower limit=0 - 70.72 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=79.56 - 123.76 mmol/L; Male: min-max for lower limit=0 - 70.72 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=97.24 - 123.76 mmol/L. The standard reference ranges for iron are as follows: Female: min-max for lower limit=6.265 - 10.74 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=25.06 - 32.22 mmol/L and Male: min-max for lower limit=6.265 - 11.635 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=25.06 - 32.22 mmol/L. The standard reference ranges for TIBC are as follows: Female: min-max for lower limit=19.69 - 49.046 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=62.65 - 88.963 mmol/L and Male: min-max for lower limit=19.69 - 52.089 mmol/L and min-max for upper limit=62.65 - 80.55 mmol/L.</description>

        <title>Mean Transferrin Saturation Levels Over Time</title>
        <description>Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a blood protein that picks up iron absorbed by the intestines and transports it from one location to another. When iron absorption is abnormally high, transferrin proteins become more saturated with iron. An elevated TS value therefore reflects an increase in iron absorption. The TSAT levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. TSAT was calculated automatically in the electronic case report form (eCRF) according to the following formulae: TSAT= (Serum Iron*100)/(Transferrin*1.41) or TSAT=(Serum Iron*100)/TIBC. Calculated data was not provided by laboratory; therefore no reference range is available.</description>

        <title>Mean Ferritin Levels Over Time</title>
        <description>Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so that the body can use it later. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood. The Ferritin levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 48. The standard reference ranges for ferritin are as follows: Female: min-max for lower limit=6 - 50 mcg/L and min-max for upper limit=120 - 400 mcg/L; Male: min-max for lower limit=10 - 50 mcg/L and min-max for upper limit=200 - 400 mcg/L.</description>
