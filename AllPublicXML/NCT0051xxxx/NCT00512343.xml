  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this group project is to collect synovial fluid (SF) and paired sera and
      carry out preclinical studies to evaluate, alone or by combination testings, the potential of
      novel biomarkers for their prevalence and diagnostic/prognostic values in patients with
      arthritis, and to determine how therapeutic intervention regulate their levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our group has developed interdisciplinary expertise in biomarkers related to distinct aspects
      of inflammation-induced joint damage, most notably those associated with degradation of
      components of the extracellular matrix, bone loss, or associated with post-translational
      changes on protease inhibitors.

      The objectives of this group project is to collect SF and paired sera and carry out
      preclinical studies to evaluate, alone or by combination testings, the potential of novel
      biomarkers for their prevalence and diagnostic/prognostic values in patients with arthritis,
      and to determine how therapeutic intervention regulate their levels.

      More specifically, we will study (1) biomarkers associated with osteoclastic bone resorption
      and synthesis/degradation of cartilage, (2) inhibitors of enzymes (calpastatin) that are
      preferentially targeted by rheumatoid patients, as well as (3) enzymes (e.g. Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs)) responsible for the cleavage of components of the articular
      cartilage.

      Finally, we propose to characterize the repertoire of specific active proteases in the SF of
      arthritic patients concomitantly to the use biomarkers (neoepitopes of cleaved collagens)
      previously associated with cartilage destruction and synthesis to identify new targets for
      the development of protease inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis. Furthermore, our
      project will also provide the opportunity to test the potential of measuring the net
      proteolytic activity by Fluorescent-Activated Substrate Conversion as a method of monitoring
      disease activity and treatment efficiency in a clinical setting.
