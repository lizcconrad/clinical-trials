    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized controlled study of miglustat in adult and juvenile patients
      with Niemann-Pick Type C disease. Up to 42 patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to
      either treatment with miglustat or to a non-treatment group. Both groups will follow an
      identical visit schedule.

    <description>Patients aged 12 years or more randomised to the treatment group will receive 200 mg OGT 918 three times daily initially for twelve months. An additional sub-study of up to 12 patients aged under 12 years will receive a lower dose of OGT 918 according to their BSA</description>

          3. Patients who are above the age of four (4) years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          6. Patients suffering from clinically significant diarrhea (&gt;3 liquid stools per day for
             &gt;7 days) without definable cause within 3 months of Screening Visit, or who have a
             history of significant gastrointestinal disorders.

          7. Patients with an intercurrent medical condition that would render them unsuitable for
