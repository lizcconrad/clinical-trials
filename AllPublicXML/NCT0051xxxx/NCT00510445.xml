    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      GRN163L when administered in combination with a standard paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen to
      patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GRN163L is a telomerase template antagonist with in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety
      of tumor model systems. Telomerase is an enzyme that is active primarily in tumor cells and
      is crucial for the indefinite growth of tumor cells. Inhibition of telomerase may result in
      antineoplastic effects.
