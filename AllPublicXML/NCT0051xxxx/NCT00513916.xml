      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. Eating a
      diet high in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, may keep cancer from forming.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the effects of dietary soy on estrogens
      in breast fluid, blood, and urine samples from healthy women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the effects of two daily servings of soy on estrogen levels in nipple aspirate
           fluid (NAF) and serum.

        -  Investigate cytologic patterns of epithelial breast cells obtained from NAF as a measure
           of proliferation in relation to soy intake.

        -  Explore the effect of two daily servings of soy on cytochrome alterations of estrogen
           metabolism as expressed in the formation of urinary 2-, 16α-, and 4-hydroxy estrogen
           metabolites.

        -  Compare estrogen levels in NAF and serum measured at the same time during the luteal
           phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants partake in a high soy diet consisting of 2 daily soy servings
           (approximately 50mg isoflavones). The choice of soy foods will include ½ cup of tofu, ¾
           cup of soy milk, or ¼ cup of soy nuts. Replacement of currently consumed foods with soy
           foods will be encouraged.

        -  Arm II: Participants will be asked to keep their soy intake below 3 servings per week.
           The participants will also receive general nutrition counseling.

      In both arms, intervention continues for 6 months. After 6 months, participants undergo a
      1-month washout period and then cross-over to the other intervention arm.

      Nipple aspirate fluid, urine, and blood samples are collected periodically to measure
      laboratory endpoints.
