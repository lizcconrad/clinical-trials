      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate whether polarized or green filtered
      digital imaging can assist clinicians to screen for premalignant lesions in the cervix.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        -  To compare polarized and green filtered digital images of the cervix, to standard white
           light images, colposcopic evaluation and to pathologic analysis of biopsied tissue.

        -  To develop algorithms to discriminate between normal and abnormal tissue based on
           digital images of the cervix.

        -  To analyze digital images to determine which types of optical information yield the most
           diagnostically useful data.

      If you agree to take part in this study, digital imaging will be performed for research
      purposes, after your routine colposcopy of your cervix.

      VISUAL DETECTION OF PRECANCEROUS LESIONS:

      Reflectance (the ability of an area to reflect light) imaging helps doctors visually tell the
      difference between precancerous tissue, cancerous tissue, and normal tissue in the cervix.
      Researchers want find out whether a digital camera image can be as effective as colposcopy at
      screening for precancerous tissue.

      STUDY PARTICIPATION:

      You will be seen in the clinic during a routine visit. Your cervix will first be examined by
      the clinician using a standard white light headlamp, and the image will be recorded.

      Your cervix will then be re-examined with the digital camera, which will involve the use of
      different types of light (standard white light, green filtered light, cross and parallel
      polarized light). These digital images will be taken before and after acetic acid (vinegar)
      is applied.

      Researchers will use these images to make comparison studies with the colposcopy procedure.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be finished on this study once your cervix has been examined with the
      digital camera.

      This is an investigational study. Up to patients 20 will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
