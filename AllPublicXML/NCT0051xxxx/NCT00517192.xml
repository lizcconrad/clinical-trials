  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Tipranavir/ritonavir
      (TPV/r, 500mg/200mg twice daily) to the safety and efficacy of Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r 600
      mg /100 mg twice daily) in combination with investigator selected optimised background
      regimens in patients who are three-class (Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI),
      Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and Protease inhibitor (PI))
      treatment-experienced (a minimum of 3-months duration for each class) with resistance to more
      than one PI on the screening virtual phenotype resistance testing.

             virtual phenotype resistance testing. In the case of NNRTIs, NNRTI resistance in the

             has a positive serum pregnancy test at screening, is breast feeding, is planning to
             become pregnant, is not willing to use double-barrier methods (simultaneous use of two
             different methods such as diaphragm with spermicidal substance and condom) of
             contraception or requires ethinyl estradiol administration. Barrier methods of
             contraception include diaphragm with spermicidal substance, condom for females,
             cervical caps and condoms.

             (KS), and/or any malignancy.
