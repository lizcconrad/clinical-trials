  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hand eczema is a frequent and distressing disease. The course of the disease is of
      chronic-relapsing nature. In a phase III study alitretinoin was clinically effective for
      patients with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to topical treatment. This study
      investigates the safety and efficacy of alitretinoin who previously have participated in a
      clinical trial involving alitretinoin.
