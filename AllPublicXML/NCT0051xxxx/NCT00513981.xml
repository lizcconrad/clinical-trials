      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as high-dose methotrexate work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Chemoprotective drugs, such as leucovorin calcium, may protect normal cells from
      the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of
      high-dose methotrexate in treating patients with solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated time to exposure to high-dose methotrexate when
           administered as a continuous infusion at a dose of 6 g/m² per 24 hours.

        -  To relate the methotrexate schedules investigated to the magnitude and duration of
           changes in plasma homocysteine and methionine.

        -  To relate evidence of the systemic effect of methotrexate through changes in plasma
           homocysteine and methionine to any hepatic, neurological, or antiproliferative toxicity
           observed in the study group.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a continuous infusion of high-dose methotrexate IV over 24, 30, 36,
      or 42 hours depending on time of study entry. Beginning at hour 42 or 48, patients receive
      leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours for 3 days or until plasma methotrexate concentration is
      &lt; 0.2 µM. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study and analyzed for
      pharmacodynamic effects on plasma homocysteine and methionine by gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometry techniques.
