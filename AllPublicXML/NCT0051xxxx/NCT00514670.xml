    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to assess the impact of a disinfection and hand hygiene program
      on absenteeism in elementary school classrooms. Students in intervention classrooms will use
      alcohol-based hand sanitizers at school, and their classrooms will be disinfected using
      quaternary ammonium wipes. We hypothesize that the use of disinfectants and hand hygiene
      products in elementary school classrooms will reduce absenteeism.
