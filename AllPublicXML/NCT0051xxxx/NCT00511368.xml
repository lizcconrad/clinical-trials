    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate antiretroviral activity of up to five different oral
      doses administered for two weeks of bevirimat versus placebo in HIV treatment experienced
      patients, who have documented genotypic resistance to at least one major mutation from the
      IAS-USA list (2007)of resistance mutations for NRTIs, NNRTIs, or PIs. Patients will also be
      monitored for side effects, and the pharmacokinetics of bevirimat will be determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevirimat (PA103001-04) represents a new class of antivirals that blocks HIV replication by
      disrupting virus maturation; specifically, by inhibiting a late step in the Gag processing
      cascade. Short term (7-10 days) functional monotherapy studies (conducted in patients with
      detectable viral loads on a failing regimen)help in determining the potency of the drug, and
      enable dose finding. This is a two part (A and B)randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study in HIV treatment-experienced patients on a
      failing regimen (harboring resistance mutations to at least one member of the NRTI, NNRTI or
      PI classes. The antiretroviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of up to 5 different
      dose levels of bevirimat will be compared to placebo when added to a failing approved
      antiretroviral regimen. The study is conducted in two parts: A and B. In Part A following 14
      days of daily dosing patients commenced a new optimized ART regimen in addition to their
      randomized treatment. In Part Part B dosing with the randomized treatment ends after the
      initial 14 days of daily dosing.
