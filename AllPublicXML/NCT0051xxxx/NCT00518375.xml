  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated renal graft function (based on calcuated creatinine clearance) 12 months
      after transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of reduced dose or standard dose
      cyclosporine in combination with sirolimus and corticosteroids. The incidence of acute graft
      rejection at 6 and 12 months following transplantation and patient and graft survival at 12
      months were evaluated also.

      This study evaluated renal graft function (based on calcuated creatinine clearance) 12 months
      after kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of reduced dose or
      standard dose cyclosporine (CsA) in combination with sirolimus and corticosteroids. The
      incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 and 12 months following transplantation and patient
      and graft survival at 12 months after transplantation were evaluated also.
