  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the health behaviors of melanoma survivors. We want
      to know about their thoughts and concerns. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. The number of
      people being diagnosed with melanoma is growing. Many people who are diagnosed with melanoma
      are young. Little research has been done to find out how melanoma survivors feel years after
      they have been treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapidly rising incidence and mortality rates of melanoma, the most fatal form of skin
      cancer, are among the greatest increases of all preventable cancers over the past decade.
      However, because of recent advances in early detection, secondary prevention efforts, and
      treatment, the number of melanoma survivors is increasing. Little research has been conducted
      on melanoma survivors and important opportunities exist for research in this understudied
      population. Understanding recurrence and second primary cancer risk, cognitive
      characteristics, behaviors, surveillance patterns, economic sequelae, and family issues of
      melanoma survivors is imperative from a public health standpoint to promote the health and
      well-being of this cohort. The objectives of this study are to: 1) conduct focus groups to
      enhance our understanding of the behaviors of melanoma survivors, and 2) conduct a pilot
      survey study based on the results of the focus groups to further describe the behavioral and
      psychosocial issues in melanoma survivors. This will be among the first studies that explores
      behavioral and psychosocial issues in melanoma survivors. The study findings will inform a
      large-scale melanoma survivorship grant proposal to the National Cancer Institute or other
      federal/private sources of funding.

    <description>Conduct focus groups in melanoma survivors to enhance the understanding of the behavioral aspects of:
Screening, skin self-examination, sun protection, and other cancer preventive practices;
Cognitive factors (knowledge, awareness, melanoma worry, and perceived risk) related to screening and sun protection practices; and,
Impact of melanoma on quality of life, family relationships, and economic issues arising from treatment</description>

    <arm_group_label>Specific Aim 2- Survey Study</arm_group_label>
    <description>A separate random sample of melanoma survivors will complete the pilot questionnaire. To enhance completion rates, survey instruments will be developed to be both self-administered and interviewer-administered. The survey will include questions from existing surveys, regarding demographics, sun sensitivity, eye and hair color, color of untanned skin, sun exposure, skin selfexamination, sun protection practices and frequency of sunburns, psychosocial/cognitive factors: skin cancer knowledge, skin awareness, cancer worry, perceived risk of recurrence, cancer risk and screening behaviors, and access to health care and insurance.</description>
