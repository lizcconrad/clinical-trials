  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to examine the effects of LDL-Apheresis on patients with Stage III Congestive
      Heart Failure.

      Study hypothesis: Decreased blood viscosity from receiving LDL-apheresis will decrease
      workload on the heart and improve symptoms associated with the progression of Congestive
      Heart Failure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who qualify for the study will receive 7 bi-weekly LDL-Apheresis treatments with the
      Kaneka Liposorber device. Patients will assess their CHF symptoms using the KC Cardiomyopathy
      questionnaire prior to each treatment. Blood levels of certain indices related to CHF and
      safety profile labs will be drawn before and after the first and last treatment.

          -  Presence of Left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to ischemic or non-ischemic
             cardiomyopathy and have symptoms of New York Heart Association Class III chronic Heart
             failure (CHF)

             study entry. Subjects on ACE inhibitors, with approval of their physician, have been
             switched to an ARB one week before initiating apheresis

          -  Other optimal conventional therapy have been taken for at least 30 days prior to
             initiation of apheresis

          -  Subject is able to complete the 6-minute walk test and the Kansas City Congestive
             Heart Failure Quality of Life Questionnaire (KCCQ)

          -  Not currently in, or planning to participate in other studies
