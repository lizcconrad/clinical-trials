  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Tarceva plus gemcitabine, compared
      with gemcitabine alone, in the treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either Tarceva 150mg po
      daily plus gemcitabine on days 1, 8, 15 and every 4 weeks subsequently, or with gemcitabine
      monotherapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the
      target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival was defined as the interval between the day of randomization and the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death (from any cause), whichever occurs first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who have any evidence of confirmed objective of complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) criteria. As per the RECIST Version 1.0 CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants who have any evidence of confirmed objective CR or PR or Stable disease (SD) (where SD was maintained for 8 weeks), as assessed by the RECIST version 1.0 criteria. As per the RECIST Version 1.0 CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD since the treatment started. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as the interval between the date of CR or PR was first recorded to the date on which progressive disease was first noted or date of death.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
