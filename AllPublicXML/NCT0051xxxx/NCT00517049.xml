    <textblock>
      This Phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial is designed to evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of PRO95780 when combined with rituximab in patients with
      follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL that has progressed following previous rituximab
      therapy.
