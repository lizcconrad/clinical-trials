    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis:

      Growth hormone (GH), through its generation of free 'bioavailable' insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF)-I, can improve insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile of women with polycystic
      ovary syndrome.

      Study aims:

      To determine the mechanism of how low dose GH treatment affects the body's sensitivity to
      insulin actions and whether this low GH dose can affect the body's handling of steroid
      hormone levels (cortisol clearance) and testosterone (male hormones) in obese women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome.

      Study design:

      Obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome, but not recently been on GH treatment, and
      presently attending Outpatients Clinic will be invited to participate in this study. The
      subjects will be assessed at the initial visit to ascertain their suitability before further
      participating in the study. If suitable, an equal number of women will be randomized to
      receive either daily low dose GH or placebo injections first for 12 weeks, before exchanging
      over for another 12 weeks of treatment after a 4-week washout period. Before, during and
      after treatment, the subjects will be assessed at frequently with blood tests, scans and fat
      biopsies. During the study, the subjects will be studied 4 times at the Oregon Clinical and
      Translational Research Institute (OCTRI). At the first, second and final visit, testing will
      include scans to measure the amount of whole body fat and fat in the stomach area, muscle,
      and liver; blood tests to measure levels of cortisol, and fat tissue (taken from a biopsy)
      analysis to measure the density of insulin-like growth factor-I (a hormone stimulated by
      growth hormone in the body) in fat; whereas blood tests to examine how well insulin works in
      the body (insulin sensitivity) will be collected at all visits of the study.

      The study will be a double-blinded cross-over study. Thirty subjects will be screened for
      eligibility initially, and the first 12 eligible subjects will be enrolled. Six subjects will
      be randomized to receive the low GH dose (0.1 mg/day) treatment and 6 subjects to receive
      Placebo treatment for 12 weeks, exchanging their treatment for a further 12 weeks after a
      4-week washout period. The study drugs will be stored at the Oregon Health and Science
      University (OHSU) Research Pharmacy and following randomization, the subjects will be taught
      by our Endocrine Nurses to self-administer the subcutaneous GH and Placebo injections using
      Nutropin/Placebo vials and insulin syringes into the abdomen at 2200h. Randomization for
      treatment assignment will be performed by an investigator not directly involved in the
      patients' recruitment, treatment and follow-up care. The randomization process will be
      performed by computerized pre-assigned random codes by blocks, stratified by age and examined
      for possible differences in body mass index. During their in-patient stay at the Oregon
      Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU, subjects will only be allowed
      to eat the food provided to them by the OCTRI.
