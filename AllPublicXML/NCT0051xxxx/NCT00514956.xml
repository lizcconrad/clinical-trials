    <textblock>
      A great many soldiers are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with symptoms of Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD). Clinical experience with many people has shown the effectiveness of
      the techniques of Energy Psychology for rapidly alleviating PTSD symptoms. The study proposes
      to determine whether a very brief course of treatment (3 sessions) with a common form of
      Energy Psychology called Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has an effect on the stress
      biochemistry of subjects, by measuring their levels of stress hormones (cortisol, DHEA)
      before and after treatment.

      The Purpose of the Research: The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of
      Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) versus Diaphragmatic Breathing in Reducing Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorders.

      The Scientific or Scholarly Rationale: Clinical experience and anecdotal reports have
      demonstrated EFT to be effective for a wide range of behavioral disorders, including PTSD.
      However with the exception of several studies demonstrating the efficacy of EFT for the
      treatment of simple phobias, there have been no formal research studies in this area. It is
      the intention of this study to extend the phobia studies to the area of PTSD, and to
      determine what other conditions EFT might be effective in treating. Another intention of this
      study is to see whether, and to what degree, changes in psychological functioning (as measure
      by the PAI and TSI) are reflected in physiological markers such as HRV (Heart Rate
      Variability) and levels of cortisol and DHEA.

      The Procedures to be Performed: Approximately 8 to 10 subjects would be randomly designated
      to either the experimental or Diaphragmatic Breathing control groups. There will be 4-5
      subjects in the EFT experimental group and 4-5 subjects in the control Diaphragmatic
      Breathing group.
