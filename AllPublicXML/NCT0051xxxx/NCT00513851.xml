      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose on both once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) schedules.

      Patients may continue to receive OSI-930 until one of the following occurs: disease
      progression, adverse event requiring withdrawal, failure to recover from toxicity despite a
      14-day dosing interruption, medical or ethical reasons, patient request, or patient death.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically or cytologically documented malignancy that is now advanced and/or
        metastatic and refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective therapy
        exists.

        Age &gt;/= 18 years, ECOG PS 0-2, life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks Prior chemotherapy is permitted
        provided that a minimum of 3 weeks has elapsed. Prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is
        permitted. Patients must have recovered from any treatment-related toxicities (with some
        exceptions) prior to registration.

        Prior hormonal therapy is permitted provided it is discontinued prior to registration (with
        the exception of prostate cancer patients who have been on hormone therapy for at least 3
        months).

        Prior radiation therapy is permitted provided that it did not exceed 25% of bone marrow
        reserve and patients have recovered from the toxic effects. A minimum of 21 days must have
        elapsed unless the radiotherapy was palliative and nonmyelosuppressive.

        ANC &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L, PLT &gt;/= 100 x 10^9/L; bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal
        (ULN), AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN; creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 ULN Accessible for repeat dosing and
        follow-up. Patients must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study.
        Provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Symptomatic brain metastases which are not stable, require steroids, are potentially
        life-threatening or that have required radiation within the last 28 days.

        History of allergic reaction attributed to a similar compound as study drug. Significant
        cardiac disease unless well controlled, poorly controlled hypertension.

        Active or uncontrolled infections of serious illnesses or medical conditions that could
        interfere with participation.

        History of any psychiatric condition that might impair the patient's ability to provide
        informed consent or participate.

        Concurrent anticancer therapy. Use of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors during the 14 days prior
        to first dose. Pregnant or breast-feeding females.
