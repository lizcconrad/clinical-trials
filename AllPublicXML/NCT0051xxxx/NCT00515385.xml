    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase 1, double-blind, cohort study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of MGAWN1 administered as a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion to healthy adults. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into one
      of 5 dose-level cohorts, with 8 subjects in each cohort. Six subjects in each cohort will
      receive MGAWN1 (a Neutralizing, Humanized, Monoclonal Antibody (IgG1k) to West Nile Virus)
      and 2 will receive a saline control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the subject including consent for the use of
             research-related health information, before performance of any study-related procedure
             including screening procedures

          2. Healthy adult male or female subjects aged 18-65 years, with a body mass index (BMI)
             of 18-32 kg/m2

          3. Subjects must be physically healthy as determined by the investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests within laboratory
             normal ranges. To be considered normal, the following results must pertain:

               -  The serum potassium must be within normal limits.

               -  Hemoglobin must be ≥12 mg/dl; ANC must be 1,500-upper limit of normal (ULN);
                  platelets must be 130,000-500,000 μL; and sodium must be 130-150 moles/L.

               -  Each of these tests must not exceed the upper limit of normal: WBC, creatinine,
                  and (provided asymptomatic) fasting blood glucose.

               -  Bilirubin must be ≤ 2x ULN, ALT ≤ 1.25x ULN, and AST ≤1.25x ULN

               -  Urinalysis: glucose negative and protein ≤ 20 mg/dl.

          4. Have adequate venous access

          5. Have negative assays for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBsAg)
             and hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          6. Women of childbearing potential will not be breastfeeding and will have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 21 days of study drug administration as well as on Study
             Day −1

          7. Women of childbearing potential (including peri-menopausal women who have had a
             menstrual period within 1 year of enrollment) must be using appropriate birth control
             (defined as a method with low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used
             consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, some intrauterine
             contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner) during the entire
             duration of study participation. Use of contraceptive medications is allowed during
             the study. Women who have undergone a total hysterectomy or are postmenopausal are

             derived pharmaceutical agent within 60 days before screening

          8. Subject has a history of seizure, chronic headache, viral encephalitis, or clinically
             significant infection (including viral) in the 14 days before dosing

          9. Subject is receiving any concomitant medication requiring a prescription, except for
             contraceptives
