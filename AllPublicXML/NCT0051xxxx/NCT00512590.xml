  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study was to test the effects of a 10-week relaxation and guided
      imagery intervention on pain perception, functional status, self-efficacy and levels of
      distress in Hispanic adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic widespread pain condition with an unknown pathogenesis and no
      known cure, affects 2 to 4 million persons in the adult US population. One of the most common
      conditions seen in rheumatology clinics world wide, including the US, Mexico, and Spain, FM
      is accompanied by various co-occurring symptoms such as fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness
      and depression. While studies of fibromyalgia in Hispanics have been reported in Spain,
      Brazil and Argentina, very few such studies have been reported in the United States. This gap
      exists despite data indicating that there are a reported 16 million Hispanics with rheumatic
      diseases in the US and that Hispanics (self-identified) form the fastest growing minority
      group in this country.

    <description>The intervention consisted of 3 relaxation and guided imagery audiotapes used in a proscribed order for 6 weeks and used in any order for weeks 7 through 10.
Protocol: Tape 1: Basic Relaxation used for weeks 1 and 2. Tape 2: Pleasant Scene Imagery to elicit sensory involvement for enhanced sense of overall well-being; used for weeks 3 and 4. Tape 3: End-State Imagery designed to facilitate improved symptom management; used for weeks 5 and 6. Any of the tapes used as often as desired but at least once daily for weeks 7 to 10.</description>
