  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of XOMA 052 in
      subjects with stable Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D).

      The study is a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate route of administration
      (intravenous or subcutaneous), doses, and dosing regimens for future studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for T2D - Fasting blood
             glucose concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) (must be measured within 35 days
             prior to Day 0) OR Symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., thirst, polyuria, weight loss,
             visual blurring) AND a casual/random plasma glucose value of ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1

             judged stable by the investigator and which did not require a change in medications or
             dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total within 35 days prior to

             subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use contraceptive measures
             adequate to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during
             the study.

             (Note: selective beta 1 blockers are permitted); Thiazolidinediones; Glucagon-like
             peptide (GLP) agonists including DPP4 inhibitors

          -  Change in medication for diabetes within 35 days prior to Day 0, defined as a change
             in dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total

          -  Fasting C-peptide &lt; 400 pM (&lt; 1.20 μg/L)

             medication, or asthma

          -  Infectious disease - CRP &gt; 30 mg/L, fever, or infection requiring treatment with
             antibiotics within 3 weeks prior to Screening; History of recurrent infection or
             predisposition to infection; Active leg or foot ulcer

          -  Immunodeficiency

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the course of the
             study, or breast-feeding

             Screening

          -  Use of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody within 90 days prior to Screening

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the
