  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 24 month randomized research study will evaluate whether doxycycline can 1) slow the
      deterioration or improve retinal function and/or 2) induce regression, or slow progression,
      of diabetic retinopathy in participants over 18 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
      with severe non-proliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      The objectives of this proof-of-concept study are to investigate whether doxycycline can 1)
      slow the deterioration or improve retinal function and/or 2) induce regression, or slow
      progression, of diabetic retinopathy. The tests will be performed in the Ophthalmology
      Departments of the Penn State College of Medicine and Glostrup Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.
      The 24 month proof-of-concept clinical study will involve a prospective, randomized,
      double-masked clinical trial including 60 adult patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who
      have severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS level 53E) or mild or moderate
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (retinal and /or optic disk neovascularization less than
      the &quot;high-risk&quot; ETDRS level 61 or 65), neovascularization of the disc or neovascularization
      elsewhere &gt;1/2 disc area and in whom panretinal photocoagulation is not imminently required
      in the ophthalmologist's judgment.

      Systemic Exclusion Criteria:

        -  unstable medical status (e.g. glycemic control, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease)
           in the opinion of investigator

        -  significant renal disease (defined as a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL),

        -  systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg

        -  history of headaches associated with tetracycline therapy

        -  history of pseudotumor cerebri

        -  pregnancy; for women of child-bearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be
           performed.

        -  lactating or intending to become pregnant during the study period (at least 24 months)

        -  sexually active women of child-bearing potential not actively practicing birth control
           by using a medically accepted device or therapy (that is, intrauterine device, hormonal
           contraceptive, or barrier devices) during the study period (at least 24 months); since
           doxycycline may interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, sexually
           active women of child-bearing potential who use a hormonal contraceptive will be
           required to use a second form of contraception to safeguard against contraceptive
           failure while participating in the study

        -  known allergy/intolerance to doxycycline or any ingredient in the study drug or placebo
           (e.g. cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide, methacrylic acid copolymer, polyethylene
           glycol, polysorbate 80, sugar spheres, talc, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate)

        -  patients taking phenytoin, barbiturates or carbamazepine, with gastroparesis, with a
           history of gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery or otherwise deemed achlorhydric or with
           a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 will also be excluded because of altered doxycycline pharmacokinetics
           and/or bioavailability

        -  patients taking strontium, acitretin or tretinoin will be excluded due to the potential
           for serious drug interactions with doxycycline

        -  patients with abnormal ALT or AST at baseline will be referred to their primary care
           physician for medical clearance for participation in this study
