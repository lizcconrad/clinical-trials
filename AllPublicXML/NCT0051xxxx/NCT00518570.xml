        Inclusion Criteria:

        PMDD diagnostic and severity criteria:

          1. Women with PMDD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria

               -  At screening by history

               -  At the end of the Qualification Phase by review of symptom records.

          2. The first 2 consecutive or 2 out of 3 consecutive qualification cycles must fulfill
             the following criteria:

               -  For women who were not on any medications for the PMDD symptoms:

                    -  Late luteal phase (7 days which include the last six days before menses
                       through day one) daily average of &gt; or equal 3.5 for at least 4 of 7 of
                       these days on any 5 distinct items with no overlap on Daily Record of
                       Severity of Problems (DRSP) Scale, at least one item must represent a
                       non-physical symptom. Entries in the diary must be present for at least
                       three of these days for the item to be used as an inclusion criterion for
                       that month.

                    -  Follicular phase (days 8-12 after first day of menses) daily average less
                       than or equal 2.5 on DRSP scale for non-physical symptoms only. The average
                       will be calculated for days 8-12 of the cycle, day 1 being the first day of
                       menstrual bleeding. Entries in the diary must be present for at least three
                       of these days for the item to be used as an inclusion criterion for that
                       month.

                    -  Late luteal phase (6 days before menses through day 1) daily average at
                       least twice as high as follicular phase daily average for five distinct
                       items.

                    -  Functional impairment questions for late luteal phase require more than or
                       equal to 4 score on at least one item for at least 2 or more days.

               -  For women who were on anti-depressants or oral contraceptive for at least 2
                  months:

                    -  Late luteal phase daily average of 2.5 or more for at least 4 of 7 of these
                       days on any 5 distinct items with no overlap on DRSP-scale, at least one
                       item must represent a non-physical symptom. Entries in the diary must be
                       present for at least three of these days for the item to be used as an
                       inclusion criterion for that month.

                    -  Follicular phase daily average 2 or less for each item on DRSP scale for
                       non-physical symptoms only. The average will be calculated for days 8-12 of
                       the cycle, day 1 being the first day of menstrual bleeding. Entries in the
                       diary must be present for at least three of these days for the item to be
                       used as an inclusion criterion for that month.

                       average at least twice as high as follicular phase daily average for three
                       distinct items.

                    -  Functional impairment questions for late luteal phase require 3 or more
                       score on at least one item for 2 or more days.
