      This is a multicentre, observational, registry study of outcome data on SCI patients in
      Mainland China and Hong Kong. The target population consists of patients who have a SCI,
      where acute SCI is defined as &lt;7 days post-injury and chronic SCI is defined as &gt;12 months
      post-initial SCI surgery.

      A total of 600 patients (300 acute and 300 chronic) will be enrolled from 6 cities in
      Mainland China (namely: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, NingBo, Xi'an and Kunming) and Hong
      Kong. The duration of the study will be one year, with a total of 4 visits.
