  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 9</time_frame>

    <description>The number of patients experiencing a stroke during the study. Stroke was defined as any sudden development of neurological deficits lasting more than 24 hours, and if a brain imaging study is performed it shows an infarction or hemorrhage. A transient ischemic attack is a neurological deficit lasting less than 24 hours and, if an imaging study is performed, shows no evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimum Lumen Diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Minimum lumen diameter (MLD) is defined as the smallest diameter in millimeters (mm) in the arterial segment of interest measured angiographically.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (following revascularization) and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Late loss is defined as minimum lumen diameter (MLD) immediately post-procedure minus MLD at the time of follow-up, in mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Binary Restenosis</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Binary restenosis was defined by a &gt;50% diameter stenosis at follow-up study, assessed by angiography.</description>

    <measure>Diameter Stenosis</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diameter stenosis is calculated as [1 - (minimum lumen diameter (MLD) / reference vessel diameter)] * 100, where the reference vessel diameter is the vessel diameter measured in a healthy segment of the target vessel proximal as close as possible to the lesion.</description>

          <description>Target lesion revascularization (TLR) was defined as repeat percutaneous intervention or bypass surgery of the previously treated target lesion (or blockage). The percentage of participants requiring revascularization of the target lesion was determined by stenosis of &gt; 50% confirmed by angiography.</description>
