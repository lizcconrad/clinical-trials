  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 2 study recruiting low, moderate, and high likelihood ACS
      patients from approximately 60 centers. Patients will be imaged with iodofiltic acid I 123
      for the detection of myocardial ischemia. Readers independent of the clinical study centers
      will review results of imaging studies in a blinded fashion at an imaging core lab. The
      resulting independent reading of the images will be compared against the truth standard for
      ACS.

    <measure>Sensitivity, Specificity of Detecting Myocardial Ischemia (Reader 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolled subjects were imaged (10 minutes post-injection) using iodofiltic acid I 123 SPECT and the resulting data were reviewed in blinded reads by readers independent of the study centers and the Sponsor. The results obtained in these blinded reads were compared with the final diagnosis for each subject with regard to myocardial ischemia or ACS, determined by the Final Diagnosis Clinical Endpoints Committee (FDCEC).
Sensitivity = % (n/N): N = number of subjects positive for ischemia per the FDCEC; n = subset of N positive for ischemia per the blinded Majority Read (two of three readers) of iodofiltic acid I 123 readers.
Specificity = % (n/N): N = number of subjects negative for ischemia per the FDCEC; n = subset of N negative for ischemia per the blinded Majority Read (two of three readers) of iodofiltic acid I 123 readers.</description>

        <description>Enrolled subjects were imaged (10 minutes post-injection) using iodofiltic acid I 123 SPECT and the resulting data were reviewed in blinded reads by readers independent of the study centers and the Sponsor. The results obtained in these blinded reads were compared with the final diagnosis for each subject with regard to myocardial ischemia or ACS, determined by the Final Diagnosis Clinical Endpoints Committee (FDCEC).
Sensitivity = % (n/N): N = number of subjects positive for ischemia per the FDCEC; n = subset of N positive for ischemia per the blinded Majority Read (two of three readers) of iodofiltic acid I 123 readers.
