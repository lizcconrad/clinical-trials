  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) appears to play a central role in the process
      leading to peritoneal angiogenesis and increased level of VEGF may contribute to high
      peritoneal small-solute transport rate (PSTR) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
      (CAPD) patients in adult. In children, lymphatic absorption of solute is greater than adult.
      VEGF-C is related to lymphogenesis, but its role in peritoneal solute transport rate is not
      known. In this study, we evaluated possible relationship between dialysate VEGF and VEGF-C
      levels and PSTR in children.

      There was significant correlation between dialysate VEGF165 and VEGF-C levels and significant
      correlation was noted between dialysate VEGF165 and PSTR. Interestingly, dialysate VEGF-C
      levels had significant correlation with PSTR. High PSTR seems to be related to elevated
      VEGF-C and VEGF.
