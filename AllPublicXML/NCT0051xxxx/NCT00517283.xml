  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As exenatide slows the rate at which materials leave the stomach, it is likely to alter the
      rate of intestinal absorption of oral drugs when administered within a certain timeframe
      relative to exenatide. In addition, the residence time within the stomach of other medication
      may be prolonged and data from this study will help assess the change in residence time in
      the presence of therapeutic doses of exenatide. This study will also evaluate the
      relationship between blood levels of exenatide and parameters measuring rate of stomach
      emptying.

    <measure>To detect the mean difference in half gastric emptying time for a solid meal between any treatment and placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 hours post meal consumption</time_frame>
    <description>A dose of exenatide or placebo is given before the morning meal. After eating the test meal, images will be recorded at approximately 5 minute intervals from ingestion of the test meal until 3 hours after the meal, then every 10 minutes until 6 hours after the meal. In cases where significant radioactivity is observed at 6 hours after the meal, additional scintigraphic images may be taken periodically at the discretion of the investigator, until counts approach low values for up to 12 hours after the meal.</description>

             received regulatory approval for any indication.

          -  Persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
