    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of praziquantel versus As+SMP
      (Co-Arinate FDC ®) in the treatment of Schistosoma haematobium in 6-15 year old Malian
      children. The nul-hypothesis in this study is that the combination of As+SMP is more
      effective than praziquantel in the treatment of S. haematobium infected children.
