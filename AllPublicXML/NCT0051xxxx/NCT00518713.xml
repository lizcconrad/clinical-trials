    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clobazam as adjunctive
      therapy in the treatment of seizures which lead to drop attacks (drop seizures) in patients 2
      to 60 years of age with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). Patients will be enrolled at
      approximately 65 sites in the U.S. and ex-US for up to 23 weeks. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to either a low, medium or high dose, or placebo. The study will include a baseline
      period, a titration period and a maintenance period. After the maintenance period, patients
      will either continue into an open-label extension study or enter the taper period with a
      final visit 1 week after the last dose.

      LGS poses a significant treatment challenge. No single antiepileptic drug (AED) provides
      satisfactory relief for all or most patients with LGS and a combination of treatments is
      often required. Even with combination therapy, many LGS patients show resistance to
      treatment. Adjunctive therapy with newer anticonvulsant medications has demonstrated efficacy
      for some patients, although polytherapy and high medication doses are often associated with
      unfavorable adverse event profiles.

      More effective and better-tolerated treatment options are needed for this population of
      medically intractable epilepsy patients. Clobazam may provide an improved safety profile
      compared to other AEDs currently approved for the treatment of LGS and may have less
      hypotonia and drooling effects than other benzodiazepines.

          -  Patient is currently taking long-term systemic steroids (excluding inhaled mediation
             for asthma treatment) or any other daily medication known to exacerbate epilepsy. An
             exception will be made of prophylactic medication, for example, for idiopathic
             nephrotic syndrome or asthma.

          -  If the patient is taking felbamate, has been taking it for less than 1 year prior to
             screening.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.

Drop seizures were defined as a drop attack or spell (atonic, tonic or myoclonic) involving the entire body, trunk, or head that led to a fall, injury, slumping in chair, or head hitting surface or that could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the position of the patient at the time of the attack or spell.</description>

        <title>Percent Reduction of Total (Drop and Non-Drop) Seizures.</title>
        <description>This outcome measure evaluated the percent reduction in average weekly rate in total (drop and non-drop) seizures. Drop seizures were defined as a drop attack or spell (atonic, tonic or myoclonic) involving the entire body, trunk, or head that led to a fall, injury, slumping in chair, or head hitting surface or that could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the position of the patient at the time of the attack or spell. Non-drop seizures were other seizures not meeting the drop seizure definition.</description>
