  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the influence of type of dialysis on survival of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients
      remains unanswered, the present study is designed (randomized, prospective, multicenter,
      interventional) to assess clinical outcomes, and compare mortality, morbidity, Quality of
      Life (QOL) and cost effectiveness between maintenance In-center Hemodialysis (ICHD) and
      Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). These data will ultimately bring clarity on
      whether or not any difference in patient survival exists between the two modalities.

      In order to test the feasibility of patients' willingness to be randomized to two different
      modality groups and retained in the randomized group, a pilot study is planned before the
      conduct of a main study.

      This pilot study comprises of a 6 months study, plus a 6 months observation if there is
      possibility to switch the patients into the main study.

      All ESRD patients requiring dialysis treatment within 8 weeks after a pre-study visit will be
      recorded in each site. Patients who provide written inform consent for collecting relevant
      information will be screened using certain inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients
      will undergo a standardized education regarding ESRD and treatment options. Thereafter the
      patient will be required to provide a second inform consent allowing for randomization and
      entrance into the study. Eligible patient will be randomized to either PD or HD treatment.

      The patients will be followed for a period of 6 months, during which patients will be treated
      with PD or HD as prescribed at each site, while meeting the dialysis adequacy and other
      indicators. For the first 3 months monthly visits are required, after which an every 3 months
      visit is planned.

      In this pilot study, the main objective is to assess the willingness of ESRD patients to be
      randomized to either PD or HD treatment; thereby determining if an adequate number of
      eligible patients can be recruited for a future large-scale study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients who are at least 18 years of age.

          2. Patients who have read, understood and given written informed consent after the nature
             of the study has been explained.

          3. Patients who have a diagnosis of ESRD (GFR â‰¤ 10 ml/min), without a permanent access
             for dialysis.

          4. Patients who are able to comprehend a modality education program.

          5. Patients who are judged as capable of being trained for home based PD.

          6. Patients as justified by their physicians requiring dialysis treatment within 6 weeks
             after randomization (Patients who require urgent temporary dialysis before
             randomization may also be eligible for recruitment after being stabilized with
             temporary HD or PD)

          7. Patients who are expected to remain on dialysis for at least 6 months.

          8. Patients must have a negative HIV test at screening. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients that have already received a permanent catheter or access that is intended
             for permanent therapy use before receiving modality information, or have already
             received permanent dialysis (If an access is present within 4 weeks prior to screening
             for back-up purposes, or for acute treatment for life threatening uremic symptoms,
             electrolyte abnormalities or fluid overload, this does not exclude the patient from
             enrollment).

               -  PD: documented extensive intra-peritoneal adhesions, severe infective skin
                  disorder, or other situation contradicting PD (eg., active inflammatory bowel

          9. The presence of other terminal illness likely to cause death within 6 months

         10. Patients who have any other serious acute or active conditions that in the
             investigator's opinion would preclude their participation in the study.

         11. Female patients who are pregnant, lactating or planning on becoming pregnant during
             the study period.

         12. Patients who are allergic to starch-based polymers, maltose or isomaltose

         13. Patients who have glycogen storage disease.

         14. Patients who have a significant psychiatric disorder or mental disability that could
             interfere with the patient's ability to provide informed consent and/or comply with
             protocol procedures -
