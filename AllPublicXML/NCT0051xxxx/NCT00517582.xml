  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with heart disease or high blood pressure are often prescribed angiotensin
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat their disease. However, the use of ACE inhibitors
      can be associated with angioedema, a rare but life-threatening condition that causes swelling
      of the face and other body parts. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug
      HOE-140 at decreasing symptoms of angioedema in people taking ACE inhibitors who develop the
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who take ACE inhibitors may develop angioedema, a condition that causes itchy and
      painful swelling beneath the skin around the eyes, lips, tongue, throat, hands, or feet. In
      severe cases, the throat may swell, obstructing the airway and leading to breathing
      difficulty. ACE inhibitors prevent the breakdown of a natural chemical in the body called
      bradykinin. Increased levels of bradykinin, which can cause swelling, may contribute to the
      development of angioedema. Blocking bradykinin receptor cells prevents bradykinin from
      initiating swelling and may lead to a possible decrease in angioedema symptoms. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of HOE-140, a bradykinin receptor blocker, at
      reducing symptoms in people with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.

      This study will enroll people admitted to the emergency room or hospital who have a severe
      case of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive an injection of either HOE-140 or placebo. Initially, participants will undergo an
      electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart. Then blood pressure
      measurements, blood collection, a physical exam to determine the extent and duration of
      swelling, and photographs of the swelling will occur at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours following
      the start of treatment. Questionnaires will be completed by study staff and participants to
      assess changes in angioedema symptoms and the extent of swelling. Participants will remain in
      the hospital for 24 to 48 hours, depending on the severity of their symptoms. Blood will be
      collected at a follow-up visit that will occur 7 days after the resolution of angioedema
      symptoms.
