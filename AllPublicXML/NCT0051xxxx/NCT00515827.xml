  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir (MK-0518) is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor with potent in vitro activity against
      HIV-1 strains including those resistant to currently available antiretroviral drugs. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of raltegravir in further reducing viral
      load in HIV infected patients that have already achieved viral suppression below the level of
      detection of standard viral load assays when added to antiretroviral therapy (ART).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although ART has reduced the morbidity and mortality from HIV-1 infection, most individuals
      who stop ART experience rapid viral rebound. Effective ART can suppress viral load to less
      than 50 copies/ml; however, current treatment regimens cannot completely eliminate the
      infection. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the HIV-1 integrase
      inhibitor, raltegravir, to reduce viral load when added to ART regimens of HIV-1 infected
      patients who have achieved viral suppression to less than 50 copies/ml.

      The study lasted 24 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two arms.
      Participants in Arm A were administered raltegravir in addition to their usual ART regimen
      from study entry until Week 12. At Week 12, subjects halted raltegravir use and received a
      placebo until Week 24. Participants in Arm B were administered the placebo in addition to
      their usual ART regimen from study entry until Week 12. At Week 12, subjects halted the
      placebo and received raltegravir until Week 24. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      single copy assay (SCA) capable of detecting 1 copy of HIV RNA was used to assay viral load.
      The cross-over design allowed assessment of the effect of intensification with raltegravir
      between the two arms at Weeks 10/12 and every participant enrolled in the study receiving
      raltegravir for 12 weeks. Primary analysis focused on weeks 10/12 measurement and with no
      washout period, typical analysis of cross-over design was not intended.

      All participants had scheduled visits at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, 22, and 24. A
      targeted physical exam occurred at all visits. Blood and urine collection occurred at
      selected visits. A medical/medication assessment occurred at trial entry. Drug dispensing and
      an adherence questionnaire occurred at some visits. A pregnancy test occurred at select
      visits. Participants' background ART medications were not provided by the study.

    <description>HIV-1 RNA level, as measured by single copy assay, averaged at weeks 10 and 12. The quantification limit of single copy assay was determined by the volume of plasma tested. When averaging the week 10 and 12 measurements, if one of both measurements were below the single copy assay lower limits, the lower limit of quantification was used to compute the average and the result was treated as below the averaged value.</description>
