    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this prospective cohort study is to develop a simplified risk model
      for post-discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) in adult same-day surgery patients in the US
      that will allow clinicians to identify those patients who would benefit from prophylactic
      antiemetic strategies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  scheduled for an elective outpatient surgical procedure

          -  understands the nature and purpose of this survey and has signed an informed consent
             form

          -  willing and able to complete daily components of the Patient Diary from the day of
             surgery until the end of the 48 hour assessment

          -  undergoing general anesthesia requiring a tracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  planned inpatient surgery

          -  inability to communicate in English

          -  regional anesthesia alone without general anesthesia, as PONV in this setting is known
             to be significantly lower [18, 19]

          -  persistent or recurrent nausea and/or vomiting before anesthesia due to other
             etiologies, unless clearly related only to the anxiety due to impending surgery

          -  minors (&lt; 18 years of age)

          -  current pregnancy by self-report (potentially confounding for etiology of nausea)
