      Syncope (commonly called collapses or blackouts) is defined as loss of consciousness which is
      transient, self limiting and usually leads to falling.

      While the causes of syncope encompass a wide variety of factors, those due to heart rhythm
      abnormalities are acknowledged to be significantly more serious compared with other causes.

      The main aim of the study is to see if it is possible to find the cause of a patient's
      syncope faster using a device called an implantable loop recorder (ILR), which is implanted
      under the skin, versus conventional management. The device is slightly larger than a 50 pence
      coin and records the rhythm of the heart continuously.

      Although ILRs are being used widely today, we want to use a new model that is able to relay
      information to the doctor via wireless technology and internet.

      We also want to use ILRs earlier in diagnosing syncope, thereby avoiding unnecessary and
      lengthy hospital admissions and lowering cost.

      Primary aim: To see how soon the ILR detects abnormal heart rhythms or normal ones (in study
      subjects who faint/ suffer syncope).

      Secondary aims are:

        1. To see how soon treatment is started once the abnormal rhythm is detected by the ILR.

        2. To see which group (patients with ILRs or those receiving conventional tests) receives
           treatment sooner.

        3. To see which group has less subsequent collapses i.e has benefited from appropriate
           treatment sooner.

        4. To assess the cost effectiveness of using the implantable loop recorder more as a
           diagnostic tool for syncope versus conventional management (it should save many hospital
           admissions).

    <textblock>
      The original EaSyAS study (1998) evaluated the use of implantable loop recorders (ILRs) in
      the diagnosis and management of syncope.This demonstrated a significant increase in
      successful diagnosis following use of implantable loop recorders. Here there were 442 syncope
      admissions to Eastbourne in 2001. Diagnostic rate was 42%. In addition, time to diagnosis was
      quicker and therefore so was introduction of therapy. This resulted in significant increase
      in time to recurrent syncopal episodes and improved general wellbeing in an unselected
      population with syncope of an unknown cause.

      The &quot;Post-EaSyAS&quot; study evaluated extended (2.5 years) follow up of these patients. The
      &quot;Tis-EaSyAS&quot; study evaluated 3 different tilt protocols with long term ILR follow up
      describing the positive predictive value of tilt testing in unexplained syncope.

      The EaSyAS II study elaborates further the above by using the ILR to avoid hospital admission
      and optimise the use of a falls/syncope clinic, potentially improving cost effective
      diagnosis and management of syncope.

      ILRs will be implanted without patient admission and with follow up in a syncope/falls
      assessment clinic, compared to optimal protocol driven current management.

      The ILR used has capabilities to record and transmit heart rhythm abnormalities to a wireless
      receiver which will then relay the information to the clinician via the internet. It is hoped
      that this will shorten diagnosis times and speed up commencement of treatment for patients,
      and will avoid expensive tests and more expensive hospital admissions.
