      A randomized study comparing an early aggressive with an initially conservative strategy in
      patients &gt;74 y.o. with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome.

      This study had generated a secondary one:

      &quot;Causes of death in elderly patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome;
      predictors of in-hospital and follow-up death&quot;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients &gt;74 y.o. with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome will be randomised to an
      early aggressive (coronary angiography within 72 hours followed, when indicated, by
      revascularization) or an initially conservative strategy (medical therapy, and coronary
      angiography only for refractory ischemia).

      As reported in Amendment 1, the trial was stopped in May 2010 after the enrolment of 313
      patients, which was the minimum sample size calculated in order to achieve a 80% power of
      detecting a difference in the primary-endpoint rate from 40% in the conservative arm to 25%
      in the invasive arm, based upon the log-rank test for survival curves (1-beta 0.80; 2-tailed
      alpha 0.05)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 74 years of age.

          -  Have had symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia at rest within 48 hours
             prior to randomization, and ischemic ECG changes or elevated levels of biochemical
             markers of myocardial damage.

          -  Provide written informed consent before randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary causes of acute myocardial ischemia.

          -  Ongoing myocardial ischemia despite maximally titrated anti-ischemic therapy (invasive
             strategy recommended).

          -  Ongoing signs of acute heart failure despite treatment (invasive strategy
             recommended).

          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery within 30 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  A serum creatinine level greater than 2.5 mg/dL.

          -  Active internal bleeding, history of hemorrhagic diathesis or recent transfusion of
             red blood cells, whole blood or platelets.

          -  History of cerebrovascular accident within the previous month.

          -  Known current platelet count &lt; 90,000 cells/mL.

          -  Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding of clinical significance within 6 weeks
             prior to randomization.

          -  Concomitant severe obstructive lung disease, malignancy or neurologic deficit limiting
             follow-up or adherence to the study protocol.

          -  Participation in any phase of another clinical research study involving the evaluation
             of another investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to randomization.

          -  Inability to give at least verbal informed consent to the study.
