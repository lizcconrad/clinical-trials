      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of an altitude sojourn on patients with
      the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous observations do not allow to draw firm conclusions on the effect of altitude sojourn
      on sleep, breathing and daytime performance in patients with the obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome. Furthermore, the susceptibility of sleep apnea patients to high altitude related
      illness is not known. Therefore, the purpose is to study untreated patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome living at low altitude during a sojourn of a few days at moderate
      altitude in order to evaluate the physiologic effects of hypobaric hypoxia in these patients.
      We hypothesize that: 1. Sleep and nocturnal breathing disturbances in untreated OSA patients
      are more pronounced at moderate altitude compared to low altitude. 2. The increase in sleep
      related breathing disturbances at moderate altitude is due to an increase in central
      apnea/hypopnea
