  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish whether MRI scanning is a sensitive measure of the
      effects of existing drug treatments on nasal dimensions following challenge with intranasal
      allergen in subjects with hayfever. If successful this technique could be applied to increase
      confidence for internal decision making and ultimately may be used to assess how effective a
      new drug treatment is.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A medically diagnosed hay fever patient who is otherwise healthy.

          -  Aged 18 to 60 years.

          -  Body mass index less than 30 kg/m² with weight range of 50kg (females 45kg) to 100kg.

          -  A positive skin prick test (wheal = 3mm) for grass pollen at or within 12 months of
             starting the study and/or a positive RAST (= class 2) for grass pollen at or within 12
             months of starting the study.

          -  Baseline FEV1 = 80% predicted and a baseline FEV1/FVC = 70% predicted (using standard
             predicted guidelines).

          -  Capable of giving informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Available to complete all study measurements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing females.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an appropriate
             method of contraception.

          -  On examination the subject is found to have any nasal abnormalities or nasal
             polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, or nasopharyngeal surgery.

          -  Recent (within 3 weeks) or ongoing chest infection which in the physician responsible
             opinion renders the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  The subject has a history or current evidence of perennial rhinitis, sinusitis, or any
             other condition potentially or directly involving the nasal cavity, sinuses or
             nasopharynx.

          -  A history of any medical condition that would not allow the use of pseudoephedrine
             (e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, raised intraocular
             pressure, hyperthyroidism, benign prostatic hyperplasia) or cetirizine (eg.
             antihistamine hypersensitivity).

          -  Any respiratory disease other than mild stable asthma that is controlled with
             occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung
             function.

          -  The subject is likely to be unable to abstain from salbutamol use for 8 hours before a
             challenge.

          -  The subject has a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             physician responsible, contraindicates their participation.

          -  The subject has participated in another study during the previous 3 months.

          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication whether prescribed
             or not, including steroids, vitamins, oral contraceptives and herbal remedies.

          -  The subject regularly, or on average, drinks more than 4 units of alcohol per day -
             where 1 unit = ½ pint of beer (284mL), or 1 glass of wine (125mL), or 1 measure of
             spirit (25mL).

          -  The subject smokes more than 5 cigarettes per day.

          -  The subject has a history of porphyria.
