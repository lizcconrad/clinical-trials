  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine, cause metabolic side effects,
      including weight gain, extra fat around the middle of the body, high blood sugar, and high
      cholesterol. One of the mechanisms by which these medications may cause these effects is by
      reducing plasma melatonin. This study is a pilot project to evaluate 1) the effect of
      olanzapine on melatonin secretion levels and 2) the effect of melatonin on olanzapine-induced
      changes in melatonin secretion in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or bipolar
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relationship between olanzapine, melatonin, and metabolic functioning,
      this pilot study is evaluating 20 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
      bipolar disorder over 15 weeks under three experimental conditions: 1) baseline (two weeks
      treatment with already established antipsychotic medication other than olanzapine or
      clozapine), 2) six weeks treatment with olanzapine only, and 3) six weeks treatment with
      olanzapine and melatonin. Half of the patients will receive 0.3 mg of oral melatonin and half
      will receive 3.0 mg of melatonin. Nocturnal melatonin production, as estimated by assay of
      urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin(aMT6s) adjusted for creatinine, will be measured weekly. In
      addition, weekly measurements of weight and other metabolic indices, including waist and hip
      measurements, fasting glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin will be
      taken. It is anticipated that there will be an olanzapine-induced decrease in melatonin
      production. Furthermore, it is expected that the decrease in melatonin production associated
      with olanzapine treatment will be reversed by administration of melatonin with olanzapine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-65;

          2. DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder;

          3. Patients who, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, may benefit from a switch
             to olanzapine;
