    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial was carried out at primary care level in Santiago, Chile to
      compare a pharmacological intervention for depressed mothers controlled by phone from a
      central level (TM) and the usual treatment (TH) and its impact on children's mental health.

      Hypothesis: pharmacological intervention for depression controlled by phone from a central
      level will be more effective than usual care in depressed mothers.

      Aim:to compare a pharmacological intervention for depressed mothers controlled by phone from
      a central level (TM) and the usual treatment (TH) and its impact on children's mental health.

      Material and methods: A RCT wasw carried out at primary care clinics in Santiago.Sample:three
      hundred and forty five depressed women . One children of each mother was randomly selected.
      Women are randomly assigned to receive the usual therapy or a pharmacological intervention
      with periodical telephone contacts with medical collaboration personnel, to reinforce
      compliance with treatment and educate about the disease, for 6 months. Women were blindly
      evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months with the Hamilton depression rating score (HDRS) and the
      SF-36 to assess depressive symptoms and quality of life, respectively; the Dyadic Adjustment
      Scale to assess marital adjustment.

      Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS-C), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional
      Disorders(SCARED)and the Children's Depression Inventory.
