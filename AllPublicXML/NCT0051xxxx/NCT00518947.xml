    <textblock>
      Verapamil has been found in some but not all studies to have antimanic activity. Therefore,
      we investigated the use of verapamil, alone or as an adjunctive treatment, in manic patients
      who did not respond to an initial adequate trial of lithium. Each study phase lasted three
      weeks. Subjects were treated openly with lithium in Phase 1 (n=45). Those who failed to
      respond were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment in Phase 2 with either verapamil
      (n=10) or continued lithium (n=8). Phase 2 responders were continued on the same medication
      in Phase 3. Phase 2 nonresponders (n=10) were assigned to combined verapamil/lithium in Phase
      3.

    <description>Treatment with lithium carbonate was initiated at a dose of 900-1200 mg/day. Serum lithium levels were monitored twice weekly, and the dose was adjusted to attain target levels between 0.8 and 1.0 mmol/L by the end of week one, with subsequent levels as high as 1.4 mmol/L permitted if needed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for the study, patients were required to have a lifetime diagnosis of
             bipolar 1 or schizoaffective disorder, a current manic episode meeting DSM-IV
             criteria, and ratings &gt;/= 7 on the Raskin Severity of Mania Scale and &gt;/= 15 on the
             Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients were excluded if they had:

          -  A pattern of severe rapid-cycling in which the patient consistently failed to meet the
             duration criteria for discreet episodes of syndromal mania or depression according to
             DSM-IV

          -  Sustained drug or alcohol abuse within the past three years

          -  Schizophrenia

          -  Organic affective syndrome

          -  A presenting episode that was secondary to the effect of any pharmacologic agent

          -  The presence of significant medical illness that would preclude or unduly complicate
             the intended pharmacologic management of the episode

          -  In females, refusal to use appropriate contraception; or

          -  Pregnancy.
