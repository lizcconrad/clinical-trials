      Proprioception is the specialized sensory modality that informs the body as to movement,
      position, and spatial orientation through mechanisms that track sensations accompanying joint
      movement and position. Mechanoreceptors in joints, along with vestibular, visual, muscle
      spindle, Golgi tendon organ, ligament and tendon sensory receptors, comprise the
      propriosensory system, which conveys information to the motor system to maintain equilibrium
      on a reflexive, automatic basis. Alterations in somatosensory input from mechanoreceptors
      have been identified as causing aberrant muscle firing patterns.
