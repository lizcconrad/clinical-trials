      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of four dose
      levels of liposomal doxorubicin, melphalan, and bortezomib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory MM and to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma; Durie-Salmon Stage I, II, or III based on
             standard criteria

          -  Progressive disease, defined as 25% increase in serum M-protein or Bence Jones protein
             (an absolute increase of 0.5 gram/dL serum M-protein or at least 200 mg/24 hours of
             urine light chain excretion). For non-secretory multiple myeloma, progressive disease
             is defined as bone marrow biopsy with &gt;25% increase in plasma cells or an absolute
             increase of at least 10% over prior known level. Alternatively, development of new or
             worsening of existing lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, or
             hypercalcemia or relapse from CR.

          -  18 year or older and willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has signed informed consent.

          -  Unless a female patient is post-menopausal or surgically sterilized, must be willing
             to use an acceptable method of birth control (hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine
             device, diaphragm, with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Male patient must agree to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration
             of the study.

          -  ECOG performance Status of &lt; or equal to 2.

          -  Life expectancy is at least 3 months.

          -  Initial Required Laboratory Values within 14 days of baseline i.e. Cycle 1, Day 1
             (note that renal insufficiency, including dialysis dependence is permissable):

               -  ANC&gt;1,000uL without the use of colony stimulating factors

               -  Platelets &gt;50,000/L without transfusion support 7 days before the test

               -  Bilirubin &lt; or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

               -  AST &lt; or equal to 4 x upper limit of normal

          -  Prior therapy: Patient must have had at least 2 prior therapeutic regimens as defined
             below for treatment of multiple myeloma

               -  Biologic therapy:

             significant graft-versus-host disease and is off aggressive immunosuppressive therapy
             for at least 30 days. Low dose immunosuppression is allowed (i.e. Prednisone at dose &lt;
             or equal to 10 mg daily, low dose tacrolimus (subtherapeutic levels) or other agents
             with equivalent low-dose immunosuppression).

               -  Chemotherapy:

          -  Mobilization with chemotherapy followed by either single or tandem autologous
             transplantation is counted as 1 prior regimen.

          -  Mobilization with chemotherapy followed by autologous and subsequent nonmyeloablative
             allogenic transplantation is counted as 1 prior regimen.

          -  Any combination of drugs given concurrently is counted as a single regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  History of allergic reaction to compounds containing boron or mannitol.

          -  Active uncontrolled viral (including HIV), bacterial, or fungal infection.

          -  Grade III or IV toxicity due to previous anti-neoplastic therapy (except alopecia).

          -  Grade &gt; or equal to 2 motor or sensory neuropathy as defined by the NCI Common
             Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC):

          -  Grade 2: Either mild objective weakness or objective sensory loss/parasthesia
             (including tingling) that interferes with function, but not interfering with ADLs.

          -  Grade 3: Objective weakness or sensory loss/parasthesia interfering with ADLs.

          -  Grade 4: Paralysis or permanent sensory loss that interferes with function.

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment or New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled
             arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia.

          -  For any patients whose lifetime cumulative doxorubicin dose exceeds 400 mg/m(2),
             patients with LVEF &lt; or equal to 35% by MUGA are excluded. In other patients, MUGA is
             not required but if performed, LVEF must be &gt; or equal to 35%.

          -  Concurrent administration of liposomal doxorubicin, melphalan, and bortezomib (single
             or two drug combinations of these are permissable).

          -  Less than 3 weeks since most recent chemotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy.

          -  Use of corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent).
