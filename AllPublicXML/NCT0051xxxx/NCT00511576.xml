  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the combination of an experimental drug known as
      MGCD0103 given along with an FDA-approved drug called docetaxel. This is a Phase 1 study that
      will look at different doses of MGCD0103 given along with docetaxel in order to better
      understand the effects (positive and negative) of this combination on the subject's body and
      disease.

      The study would like to find the following information:

        -  How long MGCD0103 and docetaxel stay in the subject's body;

        -  What effects, good and/or bad, MGCD0103 and docetaxel have on the subject and on his/her
           cancer; and

        -  If the genetic and chemical make-up of the subject's blood cells and tumor cells play a
           role in how you respond or do not respond to MGCD0103 and docetaxel.

      This Phase 1 study will evaluate escalating doses of orally administered MGCD0103 in
      combination with two fixed doses (60 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2) of IV docetaxel. In the US,
      docetaxel is recommended at these or even higher doses (up to 100 mg/m2), both as a single
      agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil), for the treatment of NSCLC, prostate cancer, gastric
      adenocarcinoma, and head and neck cancer. In Japan, 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel is the approved
      dose for the treatment of breast cancer.

      MGCD0103 belongs to the class of more selective, less globally cytotoxic agents being
      investigated for treatment of cancers today, and may offer a lesser and/or non-overlapping
      toxicity profile than the cytotoxic agents with which docetaxel is currently combined.
      MGCD0103 doses ranging from 50 to 135 mg have been administered in combination with the
      approved regimen of azacitidine (Vidaza®) (75 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 weeks) to patients
      with high-risk MDS and AML. A 50 mg dose of MGCD0103 has been administered in combination
      with the approved regimen of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of
      each 4-week cycle) to patients with advanced solid tumors; higher doses of MGCD0103 will soon
      be evaluated in that trial.

      Given the above, the proposed starting dose of 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel and 50 mg MGCD0103 is
      considered appropriately safe for initial investigation of this combination. Based on the
      results observed in Part 1, the study may also evaluate 75 mg/m2 IV docetaxel and escalating
      doses of orally administered MGCD0103 in Part 2 in order to determine whether this dosing
      regimen is safe and would also warrant further investigation.

    <description>In both Parts 1 and 2, subsequent doses of MGCD0103 will be escalated in 25 mg increments until the MTD of MGCD0103 in combination with each fixed dose (60 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2) ofIV docetaxel is determined.
In both parts 1 and 2, MGCD0103 will be administered orally TIW for 3 weeks beginning on Day 1 at 1 hour prior to the start of the IV docetaxel infusion.
There will be no scheduled break between cycles and no limit to the number of cycles a subject can receive provided they do not have disease progression as defined by RECIST, or a clinically significant drug-related adverse event (AE) that does not resolve or respond to treatment intervention with 3 weeks.</description>
