    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate superiority of the
      effect of NN-220 compared with that of placebo as assessed by the change in percent in
      truncal fat (kg) from baseline to 24 weeks' treatment (end of treatment) in patients with
      Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (GHDA).
