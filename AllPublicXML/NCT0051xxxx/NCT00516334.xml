      This study is evaluating whether a bedside brainwave monitor can be used to detect early
      brain injury in premature infants.

      Patient enrollment and electroencephalographic (EEG) and clinical data collection stopped May
      2009. Data analysis is ongoing, and results have been described (O'Reilly D, Navakatikyan MA,
      Filip M, Greene D, Van Marter LJ. Peak to Peak Amplitude in Neonatal Brain Monitoring of
      Premature Infants. Clin Neurophysiol 2012 May 16), via publication in a peer-reviewed
      journal. Another manuscript has been completed and is undergoing revision for resubmission.
      We anticipate several additional articles will be completed from the data collected during
      this study. There is no relationship between industry and no current funding for this study.
      We maintain institutional review board approval due to ongoing data analysis.
