      The objective of this study is to explore the onset of action when serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whereas serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) usually require weeks of treatment to
      effectively counteract depressed mood or anxiety, several studies suggest that they may
      reduce the symptoms irritability and anger more rapidly. In line with this, SRIs have been
      shown to reduce certain symptoms, including irritability, in women with premenstrual
      dysphoric disorder (PMDD) when the drug only is administered from ovulation to menstruation
      only, which indicates an onset of action of 10 days or less. How fast this effect appears in
      terms of hours or days is, however, not known. The objective of this study was to explore
      this issue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient should have participated in an ongoing placebo-controlled trial regarding
             the effect of paroxetine in PMD; to be included in that trial, she must have fulfilled
             the diagnostic criteria A-C of PMDD in DSM-IV and certain other inclusion and
             exclusion criteria which are listed in appendix 1.

          -  The patient should a) have been given paroxetine during the previous trial, b) have
             reported that she has been &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; by this treatment,
             c) have displayed a marked reduction in VAS-rated irritability during treatment, and
             d) have reported that she has found the side-effects tolerable.

          -  The patient should display at least a 50% increase in VAS-rated irritability during
             the luteal phase (mean of last five days prior to menses) as compared the follicular
             phase (days 6-10) during one cycle of pretreatment symptom rating (without
             medication).

          -  The patient should have given written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant psychiatric disorder for which SRIs are known to be effective.

          -  Any other concomitant psychiatric disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, would
             render the patient unsuitable for the study.

          -  Any somatic disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, would render the patient
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Any ongoing medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the
             patient unsuitable for the study. Examples of medications that preclude participation
             in the study are: 1) any psychotropic drug, with the exception of the occasional use
             of hypnotics, 2) any hormonal preparation, with the exception of thyroid hormone, 3)
             anti-coagulants, and 4) 5HT1D agonists. Occasional use of analgesic compounds does not
             preclude participation.

          -  Patient characteristics which, in the opinion of the investigator, are likely to
             reduce compliance with the protocol.
