  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of surgical
      OSA treatment by evaluating its impact on these health-related and functional outcomes and
      comparing these effects to the changes in respiratory physiology achieved after surgery. To
      achieve this goal, we will examine key health-related (C-reactive protein, homocysteine,
      leptin, the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, and heart rate variability) and
      functional (sleep-related quality of life and vigilance) measures among a surgical group of
      OSA patients who do not tolerate non-surgical treatment (positive airway pressure, PAP) and a
      comparison group of matched OSA patients who tolerate PAP.

      The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of surgical
      OSA treatment by evaluating its impact on these health-related and functional outcomes and
      comparing these effects to the changes in respiratory physiology achieved after surgery. To

      OSA patients who do not tolerate non-surgical treatment (positive airway pressure, PAP) and a
      comparison group of matched OSA patients who tolerate PAP. We propose to measure the impact
      of surgical OSA treatment on these health-related and functional outcomes measures with the
      following three analyses: (1) to assess the changes seen with surgical treatment; (2) to
      compare changes seen with surgical and PAP treatment; and (3) to evaluate the association
      between changes in respiratory patterns during sleep and changes in health-related and
      functional outcomes measures for both surgical and PAP treatment.
