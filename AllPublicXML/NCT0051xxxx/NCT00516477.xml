      The purpose of this study is to determine whether gene transfer will be safe and effective in
      the treatment of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)is a severe early onset retinal degeneration. Diagnosis is
      usually made during the first few months of life in infants who present with severely
      impaired vision, abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and abnormal electroretinograms (ERG)
      indicating decreased retinal function. There is an inevitable progression to total blindness
      in these individuals due to death of photoreceptor cells. There is presently no treatment for
      this disease. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 to subjects with LCA due to confirmed biallelic
      RPE65 mutations. The secondary objective is to assess the objective clinical measures of
      efficacy in human subjects.

    <description>Subjects will be dosed unilaterally (one eye) beginning with the lowest dose. Subjects will be injected with AAV2-hRPE65v2 by means of a subretinal injection. Dose escalation to the next cohort will be dependent on assessment of the safety data by the DSMB out to at least 4 weeks following the injection. Because there is a delay between time of delivery of AAV2 and the peak transgene expression there will be a delay of six weeks between all subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects of any ethnic group are eligible for participation in this
             study, providing they meet the following criteria:

               1. Must be willing to adhere to protocol and companion protocol for long-term
                  follow-up as evidenced by written informed consent or parental permission and
                  subject assent.

               2. Adults and children diagnosed with LCA.

               3. Molecular diagnosis of LCA due to RPE65 mutations (homozygotes or compound
                  heterozygotes) by a CLIA-approved laboratory.

               4. Age eight years old or older at the time of administration.

               5. Visual acuity â‰¤ 20/160 or visual field less than 20 degrees in the eye to be
                  injected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        SUBJECTS WILL NOT BE EXCLUDED BASED ON THEIR GENDER, RACE OR ETHNICITY.

        Subjects who meet any of the following conditions are excluded from the clinical study:

          1. Unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study.

          2. Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past six months.

          3. Pre-existing eye conditions that would preclude the planned surgery or interfere with
             the interpretation of study endpoints (for example, glaucoma, corneal or lenticular
             opacities).

          4. Lack of sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means, such as
             optical coherence tomography (OCT) and/or ophthalmoscopy. Specifically, if indirect
             ophthalmoscopy reveals less than 1 disc area of retina which is not involved by
             complete retinal degeneration (indicated by geographic atrophy, thinning with tapetal
             sheen, or confluent intraretinal pigment migration), these eyes will be excluded. In
             addition, in eyes where optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of sufficient quality
             can be obtained, areas of retina with thickness measurements less than 100 um, or
             absence of neural retina, will not be targeted for delivery of AAV2-hRPE65v2.

          5. Complicating systemic diseases or clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory
             values. Complicating systemic diseases would include those in which the disease
             itself, or the treatment for the disease, can alter ocular function. Examples are
             malignancies whose treatment could affect central nervous system function (for
             example, radiation treatment of the orbit; leukemia with CNS/optic nerve involvement).
             Also excluded would be subjects with immuno-compromising diseases, as there could be
             susceptibility to opportunistic infection (such as CMV retinitis). Subjects with
             diabetes or sickle cell disease would be excluded if they had any manifestation of
             advanced retinopathy (e.g. macular edema or proliferative changes). Subjects with
             juvenile rheumatoid arthritis could be excluded due to increased infection risk after
             surgery due to poor wound healing. Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B, C, and
             HIV will be excluded.

          6. Prior ocular surgery within six months.

          7. Known sensitivity to medications planned for use in the peri-operative period.

          8. Individuals of childbearing potential who are pregnant or unwilling to use effective
             contraception for the duration of the study.

          9. Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study and, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study.

         10. Subjects will be excluded if immunological studies show presence of neutralizing
             antibodies to AAV2 above 1:1000.
