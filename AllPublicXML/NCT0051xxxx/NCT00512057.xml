  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidity of patients with cardiac syndrome X (typical anginal-like chest pain and normal
      coronary arteriograms) is high with continuing episodes of chest pain and frequent hospital
      readmissions. Management of this syndrome represents a major challenge to the treating
      physician. Evidence for the important role of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in
      the pathogenesis of cardiac syndrome X has been recently strengthened by the finding that
      basal superoxide production predicts future cardiovascular events in this patient group. The
      investigators have recently shown that high-dose allopurinol abolishes vascular oxidative
      stress and improves endothelial function in patients with chronic heart failure, which makes
      allopurinol a prime candidate to reduce oxidative stress in syndrome X. The hypothesis to be
      tested in this study is whether allopurinol offers dual benefits of improving vascular
      function and reducing myocardial ischaemia in patients with cardiac syndrome X. This study
      may discover a novel way to improve endothelial function and anginal symptoms which are often
      debilitating in these patients.
