      LAY SUMMARY:

      IBI is costly and there are currently long waitlists of children who are in need of
      treatment. The investigators have clinical and ethical obligations to determine more
      appropriate alternatives to IBI for children making few gains because all children with
      autism deserve treatment based on their needs. This study is designed to determine the
      effectiveness of a functional skills group intervention, based on the principles of applied
      behaviour analysis, for children responding slowly to IBI. Specifically, it will investigate
      the effectiveness of functional behavioural skills training in addition to IBI at increasing
      a child's independence in day to day communication and self-help skills and reducing
      behaviour problems, as well as increasing parental competence and decreasing caregiver strain
      compared with IBI alone. Having an effective alternative to IBI for children making few gains
      is relevant from the standpoint of i) preventing exposure to potentially intrusive
      interventions for those children making few gains in IBI, ii) allowing children making few
      gains in IBI to access effective treatment, iii) opening limited IBI spots for children who
      would benefit from IBI, and iv) making better use of limited health resources. Overall, the
      results will be of interest to parent, clinicians, researchers and funding bodies.

      HYPOTHESES

      Four main hypotheses are presented to examine the effectiveness of involvement in the ABA
      functional skills group in improving parent training and functional skills and behaviour in
      young children with ASD who do not master the ELM. We focus our hypotheses on child measures
      of functional self help skills, behaviour and cognition as well as parental measures of
      caregiver strain and sense of competence.

      Participants (i.e. children predicted to have poor response to IBI alone) who attend the
      functional skills group for 8 months will have:

        1. greater decreases in interfering behaviour as measured on the Developmental Behaviour
           Checklist and ratings of behaviour during observations compared to children receiving
           IBI alone.

        2. greater increases in self-help as measured on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales II,
           and greater independence in eating, toileting, requesting, hand washing, and responding
           to name as measured by independent ratings of these skills compared with those children
           receiving IBI alone.

        3. parents of these children will have greater improvements in their sense of competence as
           a parent and greater reductions in caregiver strain, compared with parents of children
           receiving IBI alone.

        4. a similar pattern of little or no change in cognitive function compared with children
           who receive only IBI based on the Stanford Binet. In other words, there will be no
           difference between the experimental and control group on the measure of cognitive
           functioning
