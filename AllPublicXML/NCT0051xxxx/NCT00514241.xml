      The aim of platelet rich plasma (PRP) application is to accelerate the healing cascade via
      application of elevated cytokine concentrations released during platelet degranulation.

      This is a prospective randomized study of the effect of autologous platelet concentrate
      application during surgical closure following a vein harvest during coronary bypass surgery.
      This prophylactic measure will be compared to standard surgical closure techniques with the
      primary outcome being the incidence of leg wound infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative wound disturbances, particularly surgical site infection of the chest and leg
      incision site following cardiac surgery are associated with increased morbidity, mortality,
      and costs. A recent dissertation from the National hospital in Norway showed a 20% infection
      rate in wounds after bypass surgery, this is probably representable nation wide. Prophylactic
      interventions that reduce postoperative wound disturbances and infection would have inherent
      value in cardiothoracic surgery. Ideally, a specific intervention would demonstrate improved
      patient outcomes while reducing the output of hospital resources.

      The aim of platelet rich plasma (PRP) application is to accelerate the healing cascade via
      application of elevated cytokine concentrations released during platelet degranulation. It is
      hypothesized that the elevated cytokine levels will elucidate an accelerated healing response
      of the affected tissue. PPP application has also been advocated as a tissue sealant for
      topical hemostasis.

      This is a prospective randomized study of the effect of autologous platelet concentrate
      application during surgical closure following a vein harvest during coronary bypass surgery.
      This prophylactic measure will be compared to standard surgical closure techniques with the
      primary outcome being the incidence of leg wound infection.

    <description>The GPS™ II Platelet Concentrate Separation Kit system is designed to be used for the safe and rapid preparation of autologous platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) from a small sample of blood at the patient's point of care. The PRP can be mixed with autograft and allograft bone prior to application to an orthopedic surgical site as deemed necessary by the clinical use requirements.</description>
