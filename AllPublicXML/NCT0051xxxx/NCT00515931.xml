  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are generally considered resistant to radiation, but
      no prospective trials addressing efficacy and tolerability of radiation therapy have been
      carried out. Limited clinical experience suggests that selected GIST patients may benefit
      from palliative radiation therapy. The purpose of this prospective, non-randomized,
      multicenter study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of palliative radiation therapy in GIST
      patients who have progressive GIST during or after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

      Radiation therapy planning must be based on computerized tomography (CT). External beam
      radiation must be used. Both 3D and IMRT plans are acceptable. The cumulative radiation dose
      may range from 30 to 40 Gy as administered in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions, 5 fractions per week.
      The dose is specified as defined by the ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units and
      Measurements) report 50. Response is evaluated using CT 6 and 12 weeks after irradiation.
      Adverse effects are evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects
      (CTCAE)version 3.
