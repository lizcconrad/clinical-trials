      This study will test whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is helpful
      in treating negative symptoms and social deficits of schizophrenia. This will be the first
      rTMS study to assess social function and social cognition.

        1. Hypoactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been implicated in
           generating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Abnormalities in the left inferior
           parietal lobe (IPL) have also been associated with negative symptoms. We hypothesize
           that high frequency rTMS applied to the hypoactive left DLPFC or to the left IPL in
           individuals with schizophrenia will reduce negative symptom severity more than sham
           (placebo) rTMS as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative
           symptoms subscale.

        2. We hypothesize that high frequency rTMS applied to the left DLPFC or to the left IPL in
           schizophrenia patients will improve social dysfunction more than sham (placebo) rTMS as
           assessed by the Social Adjustment Scale, the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale and
           the Social Functioning Scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most treatments for schizophrenia are helpful in treating positive symptoms (e.g.
      hallucinations), whereas negative symptoms (e.g. low social drive) are only partially
      responsive to medication. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
      noninvasive way of stimulating the brain that has been FDA approved for the treatment of
      depression and has shown promise in schizophrenia.

      In rTMS therapy, a device called a &quot;magnetic stimulator&quot; provides electrical energy to a
      magnetic coil that delivers a magnetic field. When the coil is placed against the surface of
      the head, the magnetic field can cause parts of the brain to either increase or decrease in
      activity, depending on how quickly the magnetic pulses are delivered. This study is designed
      to test whether high-frequency rTMS delivered to an area near the front of the head, called
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, can improve the &quot;negative symptoms&quot; of schizophrenia,
      which include decreased thinking, difficulty motivating, and social withdrawal.

      Participation in the first phase of the study consists of sessions lasting about 45 minutes
      per day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. Twenty-four subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive four weeks of either active (real) rTMS or inactive (sham) rTMS. Patients will
      receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brains to help locate where the rTMS should
      be applied. Symptoms will be rated at baseline, during the rTMS course, and at the end of the
      4 weeks. Patients who do not meet response criteria after the four weeks of the randomized
      phase will be offered active (real) daily rTMS for an additional four weeks in the open phase
      of the study. All patients will have two monthly repeat assessments after their last rTMS
      session to examine the persistence of benefit.

      We will also collect measures of motor cortex excitability (performed with single pulse TMS)
      at baseline, at the end of the randomized and, if applicable, the open study phase, and at
      each of the two follow-up assessments to determine whether changes in these measures
      correlate with clinical improvement.

      In addition, we will look at brain dynamics using electroencephalography (EEG) pre- and
      post-rTMS in the first and last sessions of each study phase. We will also assess the effects
      of rTMS on cigarette use, as schizophrenia patients are known to have increased prevalence of
      nicotine dependence. There is also preliminary evidence that high frequency rTMS to the left
      DLPFC decreases cigarette smoking.

             (Note: Clinically significant laboratory abnormality refers to patient lab results
             that fall outside the established normal ranges, may be indicative of the presence of
             a medical condition, and are not thought to reflect an artifact or routine lab error
             (e.g. hemolysis). Results of laboratory tests are reviewed by the study physician
             prior to any treatment. Abnormal lab results of clinical significance that cannot be
             resolved (e.g. by repeating the test to rule out laboratory error or poor quality of
             the original sample) will lead to exclusion from the study.)

During the first week of rTMS sessions only, in the event that the patient cannot tolerate these stimulation parameters, intensity relative to motor threshold may be titrated downward, in a masked fashion, to 80%, with all other dose parameters remaining the same.</description>

            <title>Open Cross Over High Frequency rTMS</title>
            <description>Following the randomization phase with three arms, subjects who did not respond, have the possibility of receiving open active treatment to the target that they did not receive treatment to in the randomization phase. (i.e. randomized to IPL --&gt; open phase DLPFC and vice versa)
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: For rTMS, the coil is held flat on the scalp. 40 trains of 10 Hz rTMS will be delivered in trains lasting 4 seconds, with an intertrain interval of 26 seconds, for a total of 20 minutes (1600 pulses per day) at 100% motor threshold. Subjects will receive rTMS once a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. During the first week of rTMS sessions only, in the event that the patient cannot tolerate these stimulation parameters, intensity relative to motor threshold may be titrated downward, in a masked fashion, to 80%, with all other dose parameters remaining the same.</description>
