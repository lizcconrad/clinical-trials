    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving temozolomide together with bortezomib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: To determine the best dose of bortezomib and temozolomide and to see how well they
      work in treating patients with advanced refractory solid tumors or melanoma.
