          -  Is post-menopausal (defined as females older than 45 years of age with 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels
             higher than 40 mIU/ml)

               -  Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening, and
                  agrees to one of the following :

          -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse from two weeks prior to administration of
             the study drug and throughout the study, and through the follow-up visit which will

          -  Vasectomized partner

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

          -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or

          -  The subject has a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia (applicable if heparin is used during pharmacokinetic sampling).
