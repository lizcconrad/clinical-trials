  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational product is a specially formulated TCM and administered in the form of a
      capsule.

      Basic pre-clinical studies have suggested that it may have good immunomodulating functions,
      increases the activities of T-cells, B-cells and NK cells, enhances mitochondrial antioxidant
      status on various tissues including brain tissues. Therefore, this formulation may have
      special values in improving symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of ViNeuro in patients with
      Parkinson's disease.
