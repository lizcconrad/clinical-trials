      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of rabeprazole (pariet) versus placebo
      in treating reflux laryngitis in Chinese patients. Patients who attend the voice clinic of
      Department of ENT, Queen Mary hospital with suspected reflux laryngitis will be recruited. A
      questionnaire will be administered by the research assistant of the Department of Medicine
      and ENT, Queen Mary hospital. A 12-week course of PPI versus placebo trial will be commenced
      and patients' symptoms and signs will be documented at 6-week and 12-week time. The study
      will finish after a 12-week course of rabeprazole.
