    <description>Participant satisfaction with their treatment was assessed using question 7 (ie, &quot;Please rate your satisfaction with the weekly pill on the following: frequency of administration; mode of administration [taking a pill]; convenience; overall satisfaction&quot;) and question 8 (ie, &quot;Please rate your satisfaction with the six month injection on the following: frequency of administration; mode of administration [receiving an injection]; convenience; overall satisfaction&quot;) from the Preference Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) at the end of each treatment period. The PSQ is a 34 item, self-report questionnaire of participants' preference and satisfaction for each of the two study treatments.

    <measure>Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ): Necessity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18 and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BMQ is a 22- item self-reported questionnaire specific to osteoporosis that measures beliefs about the weekly pill or every 6 months injection. The BMQ consists of 3 subscales measuring beliefs about the necessity of the medication for controlling osteoporosis, concern with the adverse consequences of taking the medication, and preference for one medication over the other.
Participants' beliefs about the necessity of the prescribed medication to treat osteoporosis were based on the average of 5 items from the BMQ that form the necessity score. The necessity score ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating stronger beliefs about the necessity of the prescribed medication for controlling osteoporosis.</description>

    <description>The BMQ is a 22- item self-reported questionnaire specific to osteoporosis that measures beliefs about the weekly pill or every 6 months injection. The BMQ consists of 3 subscales measuring beliefs about the necessity of the medication for controlling osteoporosis, concern with the adverse consequences of taking the medication, and preference for one medication over the other. Participants' concern about the adverse consequences of taking the medication for controlling osteoporosis was based on the average of 10 items from the BMQ that form the concern score. The concern score ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating stronger concerns about the adverse consequences of taking the prescribed medication for controlling osteoporosis.</description>

    <description>The BMQ is a 22- item self-reported questionnaire specific to osteoporosis that measures beliefs about the weekly pill or every 6 months injection. The BMQ consists of 3 subscales measuring beliefs about the necessity of the medication for controlling osteoporosis, concern with the adverse consequences of taking the medication, and preference for one medication over the other. The BMQ preference score, which measures a participant's overall evaluation of a medication, is based on the average of 7 items in the BMQ. The preference score ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating stronger preference for one medication over the other.</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) to Alendronate in the First Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, Month 12 (treatment period 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The MARs questionnaire is a validated, self-reported instrument for assessing treatment adherence. Participants report how often they engage in each of 5 aspects of non-adherent behavior (forgetting to take a dose, changing the dose, stop taking them for a while, deciding to not take a dose, or taking less than instructed). Scores are summed over the 5 items, the total score ranges from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater self-reported adherence. The MARS was collected at the month 6 and month 12 visits of each treatment period only for those participants receiving oral alendronate during that period.</description>

        <title>Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ): Necessity Score</title>
        <description>The BMQ is a 22- item self-reported questionnaire specific to osteoporosis that measures beliefs about the weekly pill or every 6 months injection. The BMQ consists of 3 subscales measuring beliefs about the necessity of the medication for controlling osteoporosis, concern with the adverse consequences of taking the medication, and preference for one medication over the other.
Participants' beliefs about the necessity of the prescribed medication to treat osteoporosis were based on the average of 5 items from the BMQ that form the necessity score. The necessity score ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating stronger beliefs about the necessity of the prescribed medication for controlling osteoporosis.</description>

        <title>Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) to Alendronate in the First Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The MARs questionnaire is a validated, self-reported instrument for assessing treatment adherence. Participants report how often they engage in each of 5 aspects of non-adherent behavior (forgetting to take a dose, changing the dose, stop taking them for a while, deciding to not take a dose, or taking less than instructed). Scores are summed over the 5 items, the total score ranges from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater self-reported adherence. The MARS was collected at the month 6 and month 12 visits of each treatment period only for those participants receiving oral alendronate during that period.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
