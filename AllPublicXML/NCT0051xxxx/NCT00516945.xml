  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with non-lymphoma and non-leukaemia cancer who are also hepatitis B carriers will
      have a risk of hepatitis B reactivation during chemotherapy. Lamivudine can be used
      effectively to control hepatitis upon reactivation during chemotherapy and the chemotherapy
      may not need to be interrupted. The study aims to investigate whether adding the anti-viral
      drug Lamivudine at the start of chemotherapy for all patients, rather than at the time of
      hepatitis reactivation for those with reactivation, will help to improve the delivery of
      chemotherapy in these patients.
