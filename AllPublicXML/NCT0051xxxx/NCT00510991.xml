      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation
      versus best medical therapy in patients with acute severe asthma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past, the mainstay of treatment for patients progressing to respiratory failure from
      acute asthma was intubation and mechanical ventilation. Newer strategies to prevent these
      intubations to prevent the inherent complications are being explored in form of various
      pharmacological means like heliox, magnesium sulfate etc. Non pharmacological strategies
      among which non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is one of the most challenging
      after showing success in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD) and
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

      Data on efficacy of NIPPV in the management of AA is sparse but has the potential to improve
      the management of acute severe asthma. Noninvasive ventilation merits further studies in
      patients with AA, and some consensus panels have suggested that its widespread application in
      patients with asthma await such trials.The role of NIPPV is not yet clear and needs further
      studies and keeping this in view we planned this study to study the role of NIPPV in the
      management of acute asthma.
