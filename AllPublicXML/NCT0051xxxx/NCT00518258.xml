      The purpose of this study is to investigate similarities and differences in the neural
      pathways of depressed Parkinson's patients, non-depressed Parkinson's patients, and healthy
      controls using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and neuropsychological
      assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common and potentially serious complication of Parkinson's disease (PD).
      Studies show that approximately 40 percent of PD patients are depressed. There is evidence
      that these patients have deficits in neuropsychological function relative to non-depressed PD
      patients. Despite the widespread toll on emotional health posed by PD, few studies have
      undertaken a comprehensive examination of the neural underpinnings of Parkinsonian
      depression. In this project, we will compare depressed versus non-depressed Parkinson
      patients to a sample of demographically-matched healthy controls using neuropsychological
      assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To investigate possible effects of
      anti-Parkinsonian medication on mood, cognitive function, and neural response, PD patients
      will be tested both off and on Parkinsonian medications.
