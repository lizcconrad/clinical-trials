    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 750,000 elderly Dutch people fall at least once a year, which often
      results in physical injuries and a fear of falling, with high costs and far-reaching
      consequences on functionality, physical activity, quality of life and mental well-being.
      Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers.
      Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls,
      gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of
      aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an
      impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome measures
      within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an intervention to
      reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the
      number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and
      functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In
      addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be
      cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high
      short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a
      higher risk of falling, worse gait performance and cognitive decline after long term
      follow-up.

      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial.

      Study Population: 160 patients referred to a geriatric outpatient clinic, who fell at least
      once in the last 6 months and their primary caregivers (N=160).

      Intervention: A multifaceted fall prevention program for frail elders to reduce falls
      incidence rate, consisting of physical and cognitive components. Moreover, it includes a
      training program for caregivers in which they learn to support and give advice to the
      patients, aiming to decrease the burden on the caregivers.

      Primary Outcome Measures: The fall incidence rate is the primary outcome measure. Total
      observation time of falls will be 6 months after the start of the intervention.

      Secondary Outcome Measures: In the patients, the secondary outcome measures are fear of
      falling (FES), quality of life (MOS-20), depression and general anxiety, functional
      performance in activities of daily living, physical activity, mobility, gait parameters, body
      sway and biomarkers of endothelial function and frailty. For the caregiver, the secondary
      outcome measures are caregiver's burden, mood and quality of life. In addition,
      intraindividual variability of cognition, balance and gait in both patients and caregivers,
      will be assessed and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be determined.

      Nature and Extent of the Burden and Risks Associated with Participation, Benefit and Group
      Relatedness: The outcome of this study may have important reflections on protocols to prevent
      falling among elders and on health care decision makers to stimulate starting new fall
      clinics and implement these protocols. Through this study, the well-being and functionality
      of frail elders and their caregivers could be improved. As falling has an enormous economic
      burden, a new effective fall prevention intervention could reduce health care costs
      substantially. The tests consisting of questionnaires and gait and balance measurement are
      non-invasive and safe. Taking blood samples is an invasive procedure, although no serious
      adverse effects are expected. There are no foreseeable risks associated with participation in
      this study. However, a burden will be placed on participating individuals because the
      training sessions and measurements are time-consuming.
