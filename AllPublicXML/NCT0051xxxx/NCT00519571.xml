      Primary Endpoints

        -  Serious adverse events occurrence rate (during implantation procedure or following
           implantation) related to the ImplantLock device will be documented in Serious Adverse
           Event Form.

        -  Adverse events occurrence rate (during implantation procedure or following implantation)
           related to the ImplantLock device will be documented in Adverse Event Form.

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  Determine 8.0 mm long endosseous implant stability while using ImplantLock Device.
           Stability will be routinely assessed.

        -  Determine the ability to immediately apply continuous functional loading on 8.0 mm long
           endosseous implant while using ImplantLock Device. The ability to immediately apply
           continuous functional loading will be routinely assessed.
