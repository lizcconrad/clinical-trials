          -  subjects who have taken any medication for the treatment of IBS within 1 month prior
             to screening except for anti-diarrhoeal medications or laxatives for control of bowel
             habit which is allowed if at a stable dose for 2 weeks prior to randomisation.

          -  Subjects who are taking NSAIDs including aspirin on a regular basis or within 48 hours
             of a study day.
