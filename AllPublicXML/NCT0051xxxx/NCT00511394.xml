  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is frequently complicated by derangement of body fluid homeostasis resulting in
      accumulation of large amounts of extracellular fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites) and
      interstitial tissue (edema). Studies showed that patients with cirrhosis and ascites have
      marked circulatory dysfunction. Albumin infusions have been used for many years in the
      management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites in an attempt to reduce the formation of
      ascites and/or improve circulatory and renal function. While some of these indications for
      albumin infusions are supported by the results of randomised studies, others are based on
      clinical experience and have not been proved in prospective investigations. Therefore, the
      use of albumin infusions in patients with cirrhosis is controversial. Recently, this debate
      has been fostered by the high cost and limited availability of albumin and the results of a
      meta-analysis showing that albumin administration may increase mortality in critically ill
      patients. In cirrhotics, there is a significant improvement in the low effective arterial
      blood volume, which may be important in the prevention of circulatory dysfunction and in
      preventing renal impairment. However, in an already fluid overload state such as that of
      cirrhosis, albumin infusion predisposes the individual to develop pulmonary edema. There is
      no study demonstrating acute effect of albumin infusion on hemodynamic parameters, in
      cirrhotic patients. Neither is there is data concerning comparison between albumin and normal
      saline. It is postulated that it may increase portal pressure thereby increasing the risk of
      variceal bleed. This study hypothesizes that albumin infusion might lead to alteration in
      portal and pulmonary hemodynamics in decompensated cirrhotic patients. Included patients of
      cirrhosis with ascites (based on inclusion and exclusion criteria) will undergo baseline
      investigations (systemic hemodynamics, pulmonary hemodynamics, portal hemodynamics). They
      will be randomized into two groups, each of 8. One group will receive infusion of 100 ml 20%
      albumin over 3 hours, and the other will receive infusion of 100 ml normal saline over 3
      hours. Repeat hemodynamic studies will be performed after the infusion finishes. All results
      will be expressed as mean Â± SD or frequency (%). Comparisons will be performed by the
      Student's t test or with the Wilcoxon's test
