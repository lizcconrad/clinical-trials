          <population>Intent-to-Treat(ITT) population. A subject in the FP/FF group had no baseline daytime TNSS; however, does have a baseline nighttime TNSS, that value serves as the baseline 24-hour TNSS. Therefore there are 90 24-hour &amp; nighttime TNSS observations available in the FP/FF group, but only 89 daytime TNSS observations.</population>
