  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty to forty percent of breast cancer survivors suffer from persistent fatigue lingering
      months to years after adjuvant therapy is completed. Although researchers have developed some
      effective interventions (exercise or group-based holistic program) to treat fatigue, none
      have addressed the role of the family in the patient's long-term recovery.

      The investigators hypothesize that a family-focused intervention in combination with a
      mind-body group intervention will be more effective in reducing fatigue, improving quality of
      life, and enhancing family relationships for breast cancer survivors than a group
      intervention with an individual focus.

      We propose to address the persistent fatigue experienced by brest cancer survivors by using a
      10 week group-based mind body medicine intervention that includes the family in the process.
      We believe that this family-centered approach can facilitate better communication, create
      shared illness experience and relieve conflict. Reducing this pervasive source of stress will
      not only reduce the survivor's fatigue, but also foster an opposite family dynamic with
      positive effects in many other aspects of post-treatment recovery. We will compare the
      effectiveness of a 10 week group intervention to a 10 week group intervention that includes a
      family focus.

      Breast cancer survivors with moderate to severe fatigue will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two groups and we will measure change in fatigue, quality of life, mood and social
      support from baseline to end-of-program and then two and six months after program completion.
