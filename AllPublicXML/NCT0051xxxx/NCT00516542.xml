      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the
      tumor cells. Letrozole may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving DHEA
      together with letrozole may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of DHEA when given
      together with letrozole in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerable dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of
           dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when given together with letrozole in patients with
           androgen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative
           metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone and oral letrozole once daily. Physical
      exams and blood collections are performed every two weeks. Tumor assessments are performed
      once every three months.
