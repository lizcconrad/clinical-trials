  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients who underwent radical cystectomy and bladder substitution and thirty people
      with native bladders will be enrolled in the study. After meticulous explanations each person
      will undergo sterile catheterization of the bladder/neobladder with a 14 Fr Foley catheter.
      After catheterization the bladder will be fully emptied. Randomly assigned volume of sterile
      saline will be injected to the bladder via the catheter by one sub investigator and the
      bladder capacity will be measured via a portable ultrasound scanner for non-invasive bladder
      volume measurement (BladderScan BVI3000) by another sub investigator. The volume injected and
      the measured results will remain in a closed envelope till the completion of the trial. After
      each measurement the first sub investigator will completely empty the bladder/neobladder and
      the process will repeat itself for a total of six measurements for each patient or first
      mention of discomfort (whichever comes first), after which the bladder will be drained once
      more and the catheter removed.
