  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac chest pain is a common clinical problem encountered in our practice but at
      present, the results of treatments are unsatisfactory. The pathogenesis remains unknown but
      altered motility of the esophagus and psychological factors including anxiety have been
      implicated as important factors. Reports of the single use of anticholinergic drugs and
      anxiolytics have yielded conflicting results, has been demonstrated to yield marginal or of
      no value. However the use of the combination therapy, especially with a double blind fashion
      have not been reported. On that basis, we propose to use a combination of anti-cholinergic
      and tranquilliser for the symptomatic treatment of non-cardiac chest pain. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy of anti-cholinergic and anxiolytic
      drugs in the treatment of non-cardiac chest pain.
