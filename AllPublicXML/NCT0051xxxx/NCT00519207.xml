  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the relative efficacy of sucrose, liposomal
      lidocaine, and sucrose plus liposomal lidocaine, on reducing pain during venipuncture in
      newborn infants.

    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that modern medical practice is greatly advanced, pain is inflicted on all
      Canadian newborn infants in the first days and months of life from blood tests, injections
      and cannulations designed to prevent, diagnose or manage medical conditions. Procedural pain
      in newborn infants is a significant burden to infants, their parents, healthcare workers, and
      society at large.

      This study proposes a large randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal analgesic
      regimen for procedural pain using methods that can be easily implemented in clinical
      practice. We will study liposomal lidocaine cream and sucrose oral liquid, used alone, or
      together, to manage procedural pain. Liposomal lidocaine is a relatively new anaesthetic
      formulation ideally suited for young infants due to the established role of lidocaine in
      neonatal clinical medicine. Sucrose (sugar water) reduces pain responses and is promoted in
      consensus guidelines developed by pain experts. However, it is perceived by many front-line
      clinicians to be simply a comforting agent rather than a true analgesic. Studying liposomal
      lidocaine and sucrose together is important since the combination may prove superior to
      either agent alone, and may even prevent or abolish pain from clinical procedures.
