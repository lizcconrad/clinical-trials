    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter, open and prospective study. The primary objective is
      to evaluate safety of risperidone in patients who are overweight and/or obese. It is expected
      to enroll 1500 patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder, in which physicians
      considered the use of risperidone as treatment under clinical practice with a BMI (Body Mass
      Index) &gt;25, or for patients that have increased their body weight &gt;7% in the last year with
      the previous treatment (even with a BMI&lt; 25), and for patients that have shown intolerance to
      a previous antipsychotic treatment. The study drug is risperidone, 3-6 mg per day, orally,
      during the study period (6 months). All data collected will be prospective and will include
      the following: demographic data, psychiatric history and comorbidities, concomitant
      treatment, body weight, treatment history , other illness related to obesity ( such as
      diabetes mellitus I &amp; II, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) and adverse events.
      Observational Study: Risperidone, 3-6 mg per day, orally, during the study period (6 months).
