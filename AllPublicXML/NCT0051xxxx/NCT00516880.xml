  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
      and are related to the presence of accelerated atherosclerosis. Our recent data showed that
      inflammation predicts mortality and cardiovascular death, independent of other cardiovascular
      risk factors in peritoneal dialysis patients. As a considerable proportion of peritoneal
      dialysis patients showed evidence of inflammation, it raises an important question as to
      whether anti-inflammatory treatment has any cardiovascular and survival benefit in these
      patients. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g) agonist is a class of
      drug with insulin sensitizing property. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrated
      that this class of drug has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties other than
      insulin sensitizing effect in type 2 diabetics. We therefore hypothesize that modulation of
      the PPAR-g activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing inflammation and
      retarding the progression of atherosclerosis and possibly lowering mortality in our
      peritoneal dialysis patients.
