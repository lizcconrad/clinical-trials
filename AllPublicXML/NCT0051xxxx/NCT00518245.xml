  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether enoxaparin (an anticoagulant) is effective
      in the treatment of patients presenting to the emergency room with chest pain and no
      electrocardiogram or bloodwork evidence of a heart attack, but with other high risk clinical
      features

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chest pain and abnormal electrocardiogram or bloodwork (biomarker) indicative
      of a heart attack benefit from anticoagulant therapy such as enoxaparin. However, even
      patients without abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or bloodwork are at increased risk
      for heart attack or death, if they have certain clinical risk factors. It is currently not
      known whether enoxaparin is also beneficial for these patients.

      Comparison: enoxaparin in addition to optimal standard care at the discretion of the treating
      physician, versus optimal standard care without enoxaparin
