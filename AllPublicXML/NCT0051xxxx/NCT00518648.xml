      The REFINE-PD study is a controlled trial embedded within a larger cluster controlled study
      (the IMPACT study). The study aims to investigate the efficacy of a multifactorial falls
      prevention program for patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This program contains
      PD-specific elements (e.g., optimizing dopaminergic therapy), plus a generic falls prevention
      program. The intervention will be tailored to each individual's specific risk profile for
      falls, as identified during detailed baseline examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls and postural instability are common complications of advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD).
      Falls in PD often have devastating consequences, leading to a poor overall prognosis. In
      addition, falls in PD are associated with substantial medical expenses due to treatment of
      injuries and nursing home admission. The risk of falls in older PD patients is aggravated by
      &quot;generic&quot; age-related factors, such as sedative medication or poor vision. Observations on
      elderly persons without PD suggest that a multifactorial prevention program might be more
      effective. We propose to investigate the effectiveness of a multifactorial prevention program
      aimed at the prevention of falls in PD, which is based on disease-specific treatment
      strategies with demonstrated efficacy in PD, as well as prevention strategies with proven
      effectiveness for the general elderly population.

      In this study an individualised multifactorial program aimed at the prevention of falls in PD
      containing PD-specific elements and a generic falls prevention program will be compared to
      usual care.
