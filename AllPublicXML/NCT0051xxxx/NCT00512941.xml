    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis by the B virus (HBV) and/or by the C virus (HCV) is a major public-health
      problem since it presents a long phase of clinical latency which makes its early diagnosis
      difficult and results in the development of a large number of cases to complications such as
      cirrhosis, hepatic insufficiency and hepatocarcinoma. In Brazil, it is estimated that the
      number of HBV is two million, of which 72 thousand have been reported. As regards HCV, the
      ratio is one of three million estimated cases to 52 thousand reports. Learning about the
      serological profile of the users of a viral hepatitis reference service is fundamental for
      the planning of diagnostic and caregiving actions; therefore, it is the objective of this
      study.

      Chronic hepatitis by virus B (HVB) and/or by virus C (HVC) is a major public-health problem
      since it presents a long phase of clinical latency which makes its early diagnosis difficult
      and results in the development of a large number of cases to complications such as cirrhosis,
      hepatic insufficiency and hepatocarcinoma. In Brazil, it is estimated that the number of HVB
      patients is two million, but only 72 thousand have been reported. As regards HVC, the ratio
      is three million estimated cases to 52 thousand reports. Learning about the serological
      profile of the users of a viral hepatitis reference service is essential for the planning of
      diagnostic and therapeutic actions; therefore, it is the objective of this study.

      Five hundred and thirty-one HVB and HVC serological profiles of the patients referred to
      SAE/HD within a period of 18 months (January 2006 to June 2007) were studied by means of
      retrospective analysis. The patients were classified as: a) HBV: carrier, cure, isolated
      anti-HBc and vaccinated; b) HVC: reagent anti-HVC; c) HBV/HVC co-infection: AgHBs and reagent
      anti-HVC; and d) Susceptible: non-reagent serology.

      As regards HBV, the following were found from the total number of patients: carriers, 12.6%;
      cure, 18.9%; isolated anti-HBc, 9.0% and vaccinated, 6.2%. The patients with reagent anti-HVC
      comprised 31.3% of the total number of individuals. HBV/HCV co-infection was 0.6%.
      Susceptible individuals comprised 20.5%.

      It was concluded that approximately 45% of the referred patients carried chronic infection by
      B and/or C virus, a condition which requires additional investigation and, in many instances,
      specific treatment. Strategies for early diagnosis are essential in order to prevent the
      intrinsic complications of such condition.
