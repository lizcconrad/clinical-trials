      Background:

        -  Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is common in people with a genetic disorder called
           multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).

        -  Vandetanib is an experimental drug that blocks a defective protein receptor (RET
           receptor) found on the surface of cancer cells in people with MEN. It is thought that
           this protein is a primary cause of MTC in people with MEN.

      Objectives:

        -  To study the activity of Vandetanib in children and adolescents with MEN-related MTC by
           measuring the change in tumor size, in blood levels of proteins produced the tumor
           (calcitonin and CEA) and in tumor-related diarrhea.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of Vandetanib in children and adolescents.

        -  To study how the body handles Vandetanib in children and adolescents.

        -  To determine the effect of Vandetanib on the survival of children and adolescents with
           MTC.

      Eligibility:

      -Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age with MTC whose tumor cannot be surgically
      removed or has grown back after treatment or has metastasized (spread beyond the thyroid
      gland).

      Design:

        -  Patients take Vandetanib once a day in 28-day cycles. The first patients enrolled in the
           study are started on a low dose of Vandetanib to determine tolerability.

        -  Patients have periodic blood tests, electrocardiograms, and blood pressure measurements
           to look for side effects of Vandetanib.

        -  Blood tests and imaging scans (MRI, CT, bone and octreoscan) are done every 8 weeks for
           the first 32 weeks of treatment and then every 16 weeks for the duration of the
           treatment period.

        -  Patients who have tumor-related diarrhea keep a daily record of the number and
           consistency of bowel movements.

      BACKGROUND:

      Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a rare calcitonin-producing tumor
      arising from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, is often a manifestation of multiple
      endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and can be detected in children as young as five
      years in MEN 2A and one year in those with MEN 2B

      MEN results from an activating mutation in the RET proto-oncogene resulting in a
      constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)

      Vandetanib is an orally bioavailable multi-RTK inhibitor that blocks the mutant RET gene
      product and has anti-tumor activity in adults with hereditary MTC

      OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the activity of vandetanib in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC using
      RECIST (primary endpoint), tumor biomarkers and tumor-related diarrhea

      To assess the safety and tolerance of navdetanib in children and adolescents at a dose
      equivalent to the recommended dose in adults

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of vandetanib at steady state in children and adolescents

      Secondary objectives include monitoring progression-free and overall survival, assessing RET,
      EGFR, VEGFR andsomatostatin receptor expression in archival tumor tissue, assessing changes
      in DNA mutations in RET in tumor tissue vs germ line in PBMC and after treatment; assessing
      gene expression and gains/lossess of DNA in tumor tissue at baseline, during treatment and at
      the time of progression; establishment of pediatric MTC cell lines sensitive and resistant
      cells lines in vitro

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age (inclusive) with unresectable, recurrent or
      metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma

      Measurable disease by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)

      DESIGN:

      Vandetanib will be administered as a once daily dose, continuously (1 cycle equals 28 days)
      at a dose of 150 mg,m(2), per day

      To ensure the safety of the adult dose in children and adolescents, a limited intra-patient
      dose escalation will be performed in the initial cohort of patients, with older patients (13
      to18yrs) being studied before younger patients (5 to12 yrs)

      Patients wil be enrolled at a dose of 100mg, m(2), per day (180 mg per day in adults) for two
      28 day cycles and escalated to 150 mg, m(2), per day (270 mg, per day in adults) on cycle 3,
      if dose limiting toxicity was not observed at the lower dose. If the 150mg, m(2), per day
      dose level is tolerable on cycles 3 and 4, all subsequent patients will be enrolled at this
      dose level

      Pharmacokinetics of vandetanib will be studied at steady state at the end of cycle 2 and
      trough levels will be obtained prior to the second dose on cycle 1, and on day 1 of cycles
      2-5.

      Responsible of measurable tumors will be assessed by RECIST. Biomarker and clinical response
      will also be monitored. Twenty one patients will be studied to determine if the response rate
      in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC is consistent with the 28 percent objective
      response rate in adults

        participants enrolled on the trial will be at least 13 years of age.

        Diagnosis: Hereditary (MEN 2A or MEN 2B) medullary thyroid carcinoma (histologically
        confirmed) that is unresectable, recurrent or metastatic. Participants must have previously
        had a characteristic germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene documented. Results of the
        germline mutation testing will be obtained from the referring institution.

        Participants must have measurable disease as defined in RECIST as the presence of at least
        one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter
        of at least 20 mm using conventional techniques or at least 10 mm with spiral CT scan.
        Superficial (easily palpable) lymph nodes will be considered measurable.

        Participants must be able to take one of theoral formulations of vandetanib.

        Prior therapy: There are no standard chemotherapy regimens known to be effective for MTC.
        Therefore, previously untreated partipants are eligible if their tumor(s) are not
        surgically resectable.

        Participants must be at least 4 weeks from prior surgical procedures and surgical incisions
        must be healed.

        4 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Participants must have had their last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy at least 28 days prior
        to enrollment, their last dose of biological therapy, such as biological response modifiers
        (e.g., cytokines), immunomodulatory agents, vaccines, differentiating agents, used to treat
        their cancer at least 7 days prior to enrollment, their last dose of a monoclonal antibody
        at least 30 days prior to enrollment, and their last dose of any investigational agent at
        least 30 days prior to enrollment.

        Participants must have received their last dose of short acting colony stimulating factor,

        investigational nature of the proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of participating
        and the alternatives to participating.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant or breast feeding females because the anti-angiogenic properties of vandetanib may
        be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant.

        Participants who experienced QTc prolongation with other medications requiring
        discontinuation of that medication.

        Participants receiving a medication that has a known risk of QTc prolongation within 14
        days (28 days for levomethadyl) of enrollment.

        measurements with an appropriate-size cuff or patients who are currently taking
        anti-hypertensive therapy.
