  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about how women feel about an ovarian cancer
      screening program that involves getting a blood test to measure CA 125 levels. This includes
      finding out about women's quality of life and whether they are concerned or worried about
      their risk of developing cancer. This study also seeks to find out whether elevated CA 125
      levels affect participants in terms of cancer worries or concerns.

      Participants in this study will be asked to complete several questionnaires. Participants
      will be able to fill out the questionnaires in the clinic or if necessary, they can complete
      them at home. Pre-addressed and stamped envelopes will be provided to mail back if they are
      completed at home. The questionnaires involve quality of life issues, concerns or worries
      about cancer risk and beliefs about cancer. It will take 30 minutes or less to complete the
      questionnaires.

      The completed questionnaires can be returned to the research nurse or if the participant
      prefers or they can be returned to the researchers in the self-addressed stamped envelope
      that is provided.

      This is an investigational study. This study will involve 2400 women who are participating in
      an ovarian cancer screening program. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
