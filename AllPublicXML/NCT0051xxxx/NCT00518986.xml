  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether armodafinil at a target dosage of
      200 mg/day is more effective than placebo treatment in improving excessive sleepiness in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) who have comorbid major
      depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) to Endpoint (12 Weeks or Last Observation After Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks (or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>MWT measures ability of subject to remain awake. Subjects instructed to try and remain awake during series of 4 30-minute periods (0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) reclining in dark room. Each period was terminated immediately after sleep onset or at end of 30 minutes if no sleep occurred. If subject fell asleep, they were awakened and not allowed to sleep for remainder of that 30 minute period. Change from Baseline to Endpoint (12 weeks or last observation after baseline) in mean sleep latency averaged from the 4 intervals was measured. Poorest outcome was 0 minutes the best was 30 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at Endpoint (12-weeks or Last Observation After Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C is a clinician's rating of disease severity compared with baseline as assessed by Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse. CGI-S measured 7 categories of illness as well: normal, borderline ill, mildly ill, moderately ill, markedly ill, severely ill, among most extremely ill. Proportion of responders who had at least &quot;minimally improved&quot; in CGI-C ratings (as related to sleepiness) were assessed.</description>

    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assesses the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with any score &gt;= 7 considered to be indicative of severe fatigue. The Interference Score consists of 6 questions that ask subjects to rate on a 0 to 10 scale how during the past 24 hours fatigue has interfered with their general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. The scores are averaged (0-10) for the Interference Score.</description>

          <description>Armodafinil (or placebo) was titrated to a target dosage of 200 mg/day (4 tablets) for each patient. Dosing began at 50 mg (1 tablet)/day each morning on Day 1, and then increased by 50 mg (1 tablet) on days 2, 5, and 8 to target dose of 200 mg/day (4 tablets). If deemed appropriate by investigator, dose could be further titrated to 250 mg/day (5 tablets). If tolerability issues arose, dose could be decreased in 50 mg increments anytime after 200 mg/day dose was achieved.</description>

        <description>The CGI-C is a clinician's rating of disease severity compared with baseline as assessed by Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse. CGI-S measured 7 categories of illness as well: normal, borderline ill, mildly ill, moderately ill, markedly ill, severely ill, among most extremely ill. Proportion of responders who had at least &quot;minimally improved&quot; in CGI-C ratings (as related to sleepiness) were assessed.</description>

Dosing began at 50 mg (1 tablet)/day each morning on Day 1, and then increased by 50 mg (1 tablet) on days 2, 5, and 8 to target dose of 200 mg/day (4 tablets). If deemed appropriate by investigator, dose could be further titrated to 250 mg/day (5 tablets). If tolerability issues arose, dose could be decreased in 50 mg increments anytime after 200 mg/day dose was achieved.</description>

          <title>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at Endpoint (12-weeks or Last Observation After Baseline)</title>
          <description>The CGI-C is a clinician's rating of disease severity compared with baseline as assessed by Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse. CGI-S measured 7 categories of illness as well: normal, borderline ill, mildly ill, moderately ill, markedly ill, severely ill, among most extremely ill. Proportion of responders who had at least &quot;minimally improved&quot; in CGI-C ratings (as related to sleepiness) were assessed.</description>

Subjects instructed to try and remain awake during series of four 30-minute periods (0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) reclining in dark room. Each period was terminated immediately after sleep onset or at end of 30 minutes if no sleep occured. If subject fell asleep, they were awakened and not allowed to sleep for remainder of that 30 minute period. Change from Baseline to 4 weeks in mean sleep latency (measured in minutes)averaged from each of the four testing intervals was measured. The poorest outcome was 0 minutes the best was 30 minutes.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) at 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>MWT measures ability of subject to remain awake. Subjects instructed to try and remain awake during series of four 30-minute periods (0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) reclining in dark room. Each period was terminated immediately after sleep onset or at end of 30 minutes if no sleep occured. If subject fell asleep, they were awakened and not allowed to sleep for remainder of that 30 minute period. Change from Baseline to 12 weeks in mean sleep latency (measured in minutes)averaged from each of the four testing intervals was measured. The poorest outcome was 0 minutes the best was 30 minutes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 12 or Last Observation After Baseline) in the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a subjective-completed tool for the assessment of the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with any score &gt;= 7 considered to be indicative of severe fatigue.

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Worst Daily Fatigue Score at Endpoint (12 Weeks or Last Observation After Baseline)</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a subjective-completed tool for the assessment of the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with &gt;= 7 indicative of severe fatigue. The worst daily fatigue score reports the outcome of a single item on the BFI that rates the worst fatigue experienced over the day on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no fatigue and 10 being most severe. This measure compares the change in score from baseline to Week 12 (or last observation after baseline).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Worse Daily Fatigue Score at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a subjective-completed tool for the assessment of the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with any score &gt;= 7 considered to be indicative of severe fatigue. The worst daily fatigue score reports the outcome of a single item on the BFI that rates the worst fatigue experienced over the day on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no fatigue and 10 being most severe. This measure compares the change in score from baseline to Week 12.</description>

        <title>Number of Responders According to the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Worst Fatigue Score at 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assesses the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with any score &gt;= 7 considered to be indicative of severe fatigue. The worst daily fatigue score reports the outcome of a single item on the BFI that rates the worst fatigue experienced over the day on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no fatigue and 10 being most severe. Subjects were considered responders if the final Worst Fatigue Score was &lt; 7 at Week 8.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Interference Score at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assesses the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. Simple numeric rating scales from 0 to 10 are used. The higher scores are associated with more severe fatigue, with any score &gt;= 7 considered to be indicative of severe fatigue. The Interference Score consists of 6 questions that ask subjects to rate on a 0 to 10 scale how during the past 24 hours fatigue has interfered with their general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. The scores are averaged (0-10) for the Interference Score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Medical Outcomes Study 6 Item Cognitive Functioning (MOS-CF6) Scale at Endpoint (12 Weeks or Last Observation After Baseline)</title>
        <description>The MOS-CF6 assesses self-reported cognitive function. Items were selected to cover 6 relevant aspects of cognitive functioning:confusion, concentration/thinking, attention, memory, reasoning, problem-solving, and processing speed. Responses range from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;. The MOS-CF6 is scored by summing responses across the 6 items and converting the total to a 0 - 100 point scale, with the higher score indicating better cognitive functioning. Data is presented showing the change in score from baseline to Endpoint (12 weeks or last observation after baseline).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Medical Outcomes Study 6 Item Cognitive Functioning (MOS-CF6) Scale at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>The MOS-CF6 assesses self-reported cognitive function. Items were selected to cover 6 relevant aspects of cognitive functioning as follows: confusion, concentration/thinking, attention, memory, reasoning, problem-solving, and processing speed. The MOS-CF6 responses includes 6 choices, ranging from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;. The MOS-CF6 is scored by summing responses across the 6 items and converting the total to a 0 - 100 point scale, with the higher score indicating better cognitive functioning. Data is presented showing the change in score from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>
