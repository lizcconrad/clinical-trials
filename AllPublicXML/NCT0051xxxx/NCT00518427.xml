  <brief_summary>

      Primary objective:

      To assess quality of Life (QoL) changes and treatment satisfaction in a real life situation
      in patients with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on a combination of oral
      antidiabetic drugs (OAD) plus Neutral Protamine Hagedrone (NHP) insulin treatment that are
      switched to insulin glargine.

      Secondary objective:

      To determine:

      change in HbA1c, comparision of the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia and severe
      hypoglycemia before and after introduction of insulin glargine, change in weight, change in
      insulin dose.
