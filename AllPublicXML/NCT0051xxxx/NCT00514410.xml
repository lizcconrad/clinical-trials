      To determine whether giving folic acid to people with depression will help their
      antidepressants work better. If folate does help antidepressants to work better, then it will
      provide a safe, simple and cheap way of improving the treatment of depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical depression is common, debilitating and treatable; one in four people experience it
      during their lives. The majority of sufferers are treated in primary care and only half
      respond well to active treatment. Evidence suggests that folate may be a useful adjunct to
      antidepressant treatment: 1) patients with depression often have a functional folate
      deficiency; 2) the severity of such deficiency, indicated by elevated homocysteine,
      correlates with depression severity, 3) low folate is associated with poor antidepressant
      response, and 4) folate is required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters implicated in the
      pathogenesis and treatment of depression.

      The primary objective of this multi-centred placebo-controlled randomised trial is to
      estimate the effect of folate augmentation in new or continuing treatment of depressive
      disorder in primary and secondary care. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of folate augmentation of antidepressant treatment, investigate how the
      response to antidepressant treatment depends on genetic polymorphisms relevant to folate
      metabolism and antidepressant response, and explore whether baseline folate status can
      predict response to antidepressant treatment.

      Comparisons: Eligible patients with moderate to severe depression will be randomised to
      receive 5mg of folic acid or placebo as an adjunct to their antidepressant treatment.
