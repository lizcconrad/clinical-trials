  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reversible acetylation of the histone tails plays an important role in the control of
      specific gene expression. Mounting evidence has established that histone deacetylase
      inhibitors such as Valproic Acid (VPA)selectively induce cellular differentiation and
      apoptosis in variety of cancer cells. In a single-center, one year open-label trial, 19
      HAM/TSP patients were treated with oral doses of VPA (20mg/Kg/day). Primary end-points were
      the therapeutic safety and the effect on HTLV-1 proviral load (a significant and sustained
      decrease was expected). Secondary end-point was the neurological status before and after
      one-year treatment.
