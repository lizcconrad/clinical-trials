      Patients will be treated with irinotecan (150mg/m2) followed by oxaliplatin (85mg/m2)on day 1
      and S-1(80mg/m2/day) from day 1 to 14 every 3 weeks. Patients will receive up to a planned
      treatment of maximum 12 cycles of chemotherapy. Response assessement will be performed every
      2 cycles of chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma with recurrent or
             metastatic disease

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          4. Disease status must be that of measurable disease as defined by RECIST
             criteria:Measurable lesions: Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension by any of the following: - CT of abdomen, pelvis or thorax, if the longest
             diameter to be recorded is at least 10 mm with spiral CT- Chest x-ray, if the lung
             lesion to be recorded is clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung and the
             diameter to be recorded is at least 20 mm- Physical examination, if the clinically
             detected lesions are superficial (e.g., skin nodule and palpable lymph nodes) and at
             least 10 mm

          5. No prior treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease; prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant
             therapy is allowed if at least 12 months have elapsed between completion of
             adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy and enrolment into the study. However, prior oxaliplatin
             and/or irinotecan as adjuvant therapy are not allowed.

             significant conduction system abnormality

          3. Serious concurrent infection or nonmalignant illness that is uncontrolled or whose
             control may be jeopardized by complications of study therapy

          4. Other malignancy within the past 3 years except non-melanomatous skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          5. Psychiatric disorder that would preclude compliance
