      The goal of this behavioral research study is to look at the reasons that may prevent women
      from getting early treatment for their cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about what prevents women with cervical cancer from getting early and
      possibly curative treatment. This study consists of a series of questionnaires that ask
      questions about religion; coping; access to health care; physical, emotional, and spiritual
      well-being; understanding of health questions; control; fear; anxiety; and other health
      beliefs to determine why some women delay coming in for check-ups and why some women do not
      complete their treatments. It is thought that health beliefs influence behavior practices and
      that by identifying these issues, things can be done to improve the health condition and
      results for these patients.

      You will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires at 2 specific time points: The first
      time point will be before treatment begins and the second time point will be within a month
      following completion of treatment.

      Filling out the questionnaires should take about 45 minutes each time. You should have
      adequate time to complete these questionnaires during your clinic appointment.

      If you want to take part but are too ill to complete the questionnaires, you will be provided
      a pre-addressed, stamped envelope, so that you can mail them back to the study staff at your
      earliest convenience.

      This is an investigational study. This is an investigational study. Up to 150 patients will
      be enrolled at Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital.
