  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical benefit of switching children with
      ADHD from immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) to OROS-methylphenidate under the
      correct dosage conversion scheme.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-comparative study. Each patient will be treated for 10 weeks
      including 6-week titration phase and 4-week maintenance phase. After an initial baseline
      evaluation, patients currently receiving IR-Methylphenidate (IR-MPH) therapy will switch to
      receiving OROS-methylphenidate once daily. Patients receiving IR-MPH =15 mg per day will
      switch to receive 18 mg once daily OROS-methylphenidate. For patients on IR-MPH daily dosage
      &gt;15 mg and =30 mg, the initial dose of OROS-methylphenidate will be 36 mg once daily. Other
      patients receiving IR-MPH higher than 30 mg per day, will switch to receive 54 mg once daily
      OROS-methylphenidate. During the 6-week titration phase, those patients who do not achieve
      the criteria of &quot;Optimal Response&quot; will be titrated by biweekly increase to next dose level
      (36 mg per day, and then 54 mg per day). The maximum dose of OROS-methylphenidate per day is
      54 mg as package insert indicates. However, dose decreases are allowed if clinically
      intolerable adverse events emerge. At the end of 6-week titration phase, the final titration
      dose should be maintained for the last 4 weeks of the trial regardless of the optimal
      response. In summary, all patients will attend bi-weekly clinic visits for the first 6 weeks
      (visit 2 to 4) and monthly clinic visits for the subsequent 4 weeks (visit 5). Patients will
      receive 18 mg or 36mg or 54 mg once daily OROS-methylphenidate for 10 weeks.
