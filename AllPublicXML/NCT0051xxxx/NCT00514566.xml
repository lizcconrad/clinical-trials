  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the last decade the customary trend of using non absorbable sutures has changed, with
      numerous studies and meta-analyses advocating the use of slowly absorbable sutures, claiming
      comparable wound strength with significantly lower incidence of wound complications. It was
      the objective of this randomized clinical trial to compare two universally accepted suture
      materials, the non-absorbable Nylon and the slowly absorbable Polydioxanone for midline
      abdominal closure in the Indian context.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      64 patients undergoing midline laparotomy were allocated, using block randomization, to mass
      closure of the abdominal wall with continuous polyamide (34 patients) or continuous
      polydioxanone (30 patients).

      There was an alarmingly higher incidence of wound dehiscence in the PDS group requiring
      secondary suturing (Nylon 0; PDS 5). Mid-way through the trial, an interim analysis was
      performed which revealed an unacceptably high incidence of wound dehiscence in the PDS group.
      This necessitated a premature curtailment of the study. There was, however, a statistically
      significantly higher incidence of scar pain in the Nylon group (Nylon 9; PDS 1).

      There is a need for a study with larger series, and PDS as a choice of suture for midline
      wound closure cannot be recommended.
