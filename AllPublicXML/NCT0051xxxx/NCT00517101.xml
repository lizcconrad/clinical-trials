    <textblock>
      A relationship between IBD and spondyloarthropathy is well recognized. ASCA ( anti
      saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies)are considered to be a serological marker for Crohn's
      disease and have been studied in patients with spondyloarthropathy with conflicting results.
      More recently, new serological markers for IBD have been described. These markers are
      antibodies to certain defined glycans , and their use may permit an improved diagnosis of
      IBD.

      The aim of our study is to investigate wether these new serological markers are present in
      the sera of patients with spondyloarthropathy.
