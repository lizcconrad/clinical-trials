      co-adjuvant treatment of the pharmacologic therapy use to treat Gastroesophageal Reflux.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal Reflux illness is a multifactor pathology with a common mechanism: a
      prolonged exposure of the esophageal mucosa to the gastric solutions. Modification of the
      life style and the hygiene-dietetic habits are frequently recommended as an initial
      therapeutic instrument in Gastroesophageal Reflux pathology. But there is not agreement about
      the effectiveness of these habits in the improvement of the illness. Different clinical
      practice guidances have shown contradictions in the effectiveness of changing
      hygiene-dietetics habits of the life style. The high effectiveness of the new pharmacologic
      treatment in Gastroesophageal Reflux pathology make it necessary to review the role of
      hygiene-dietetic habits in this illness. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) act in the final step
      of the gastric secretion. PPI's block ATP-ase H+/K+ in gastric parietals cells. This
      mechanism generates a higher acid inhibition, longer than the inhibition produced by
      H2-receptor antagonists. It has been described that inhibition of acid secretion has produced
      a recovery of the gastroesophageal pathology in a high percentage of the patients resistant
      to conventional drugs. This is an observational, multicenter, open and prospective study. The
      primary objective is to evaluate hygiene-dietetic habits as co-adjuvant of Rabeprazol
      treatment in Gastroesophageal Reflux . It is expected to include 570 patients with
      Gastroesophageal pathology erosive or non-erosive and acute or chronic treated with
      Rabeprazol per clinical practice, 20mg per day, orally, for 8 weeks. All data collected will
      be prospective and will include the following: demographic data, progress of the pathology,
      change of hygiene-dietetic habits, treatment adherence, concomitant treatments and adverse
      events. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
