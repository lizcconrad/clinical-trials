  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how molecules called pharmacological chaperones affect
      the cells of patients with Pompe disease. The study will last 1 or 2 visits which will
      include a blood collection, urine collection, and two skin biopsies. Information will also be
      collected from the medical records about disease history and diagnosis. Patients will not
      receive any study medication.

      The study is designed to evaluate the response of cell lines derived from blood and skin
      tissue from Pompe patients to pharmacological chaperones. Samples of blood and skin tissue
      will be obtained to make cell lines that will be used to test pharmacological chaperones. The
      study will include patients with early and late-onset Pompe disease.
