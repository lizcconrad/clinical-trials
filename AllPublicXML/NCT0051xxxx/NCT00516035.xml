    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern. The development
      of safe and effective vaccines against avian strains infecting people is important. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a new AI vaccine
      in healthy adults against the H7N3 strain of avian influenza.

      The current pandemic risk associated with avian influenza H7N3 infection is significant as an
      increasing number of humans are infected. H7 influenza transmission usually occurs in humans
      when they are exposed through direct contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects
      contaminated by infected poultry feces. A pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype
      emerges that infects humans, causes serious illness, and spreads easily between humans. The
      development of a safe and effective vaccine is necessary, should a pandemic occur. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated AI
      virus vaccine, H7N3 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 x A/Ann
      Arbor/6/60 ca).

      This study will last approximately 90 days. Participation in this study includes two 12-day
      hospital stays in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. All
      participants will receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and
      sometime between 4 and 8 weeks after initial vaccination. Participants will be admitted to
      the isolation unit 2 days prior to each vaccination. A targeted physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, and a nasal wash will occur daily following each vaccination until discharge.
      Participants will be discharged after three consecutive nasal washes on or after Day 6 are
      negative. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the study.
      A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each vaccination.
