  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of two-doses of GSK
      Biologicals' candidate influenza vaccine GSK 1557484A with or without adjuvant in adults. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has five core arms and the stratification is based on site and age. In addition,
      there are 4 possible contingent groups of which 2 will be studied based on an analysis
      concerning immunogenicity performance at Day 42 in core groups above.

          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects for whom immunogenicity data for the primary outcome variables were available i.e. all subjects had to have at least Day 0 and Day 42 HI titer results for the A/Indonesia/5/05 virus.</population>
