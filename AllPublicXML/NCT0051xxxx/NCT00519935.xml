  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is a randomized clinical trial providing Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an
      intensive home-based family psychotherapy intervention, to a group of urban adolescents with
      poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes and their families.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substantial data exists to demonstrate that improving metabolic control in persons with Type
      1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can delay the onset of diabetes complications and reverse some
      existing complications as well. Unfortunately, those adolescents with T1DM who are at highest
      risk for diabetes complications are often the most resistant to hospital based care and
      traditional education/ supportive interventions. They are also faced with multiple barriers
      to improved metabolic control, which may include lack of knowledge about diabetes, family
      disorganization and disengagement, high levels of stress and an unhealthy lifestyle.
      Multisystemic Therapy (MST), a flexible and home-based therapeutic intervention originally
      designed for use with mental health populations, seems to be a promising approach to
      providing diabetic adolescents with the ability to engage in consistent and attentive illness
      management.

      The study recruited a sample of 127 adolescents in poor metabolic control and randomly
      assigned them to either the treatment intervention, MST plus standard medical care, or
      standard medical care alone. Families randomized to MST received intensive, home-based family
      therapy for approximately six months. Families completed data collection at baseline and then
      again at 7, 12 18 and 24 months after study entry.
