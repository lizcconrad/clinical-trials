    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter longitudinal five-year study of X-STOP PEEK usage in LSS
      patients is designed to supplement pre-market safety and effectiveness data with information
      on longer-term device performance in a population of patients with moderately impaired
      physical function at preoperative baseline (i.e., an &quot;indicated&quot; population) who elect to
      undergo X STOP PEEK surgery.

      This prospective, multicenter longitudinal five-year study of X-STOP PEEK implant usage in
      LSS patients is designed to supplement pre-market safety and effectiveness data with
      information on longer-term device performance in a population of patients with moderately
      impaired physical function at preoperative baseline (i.e., an &quot;indicated&quot; population) who
      elect to undergo X-STOP PEEK surgery. This post-approval study will enroll 240 patients at up
      to 8 clinical sites where all participating spine surgeons have completed a company-sponsored
      physician training program. The clinical sites recruited to participate in this study
      comprise a geographically diverse mix of academic, referral, and/or community based sites.

      Safety and effectiveness data will be assessed at baseline and annually through five (5)
      years postoperatively. Office visits will be scheduled preoperatively, and at 6 weeks, 1, 2,
      3, 4, and 5 years postoperatively. Clinical/neurological and radiographic examination will be
      performed during each office visit. A baseline patient history (including medication usage)
      will be taken, and concomitant medications will be recorded at each postoperative follow-up
      visit. In addition, patients will be asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to
      consultation with their physicians or their staff: Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ),
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and SF-36 Health Survey. At the
      2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year office visit, patients will also be asked two questions assessing the
      value of surgery and the overall improvement in the quality of life postoperatively.

      The primary study endpoint in this study is treatment success. Secondary endpoints will
      include scores from the SF-36, ODI, and NRS, as well as incidence rates of adverse events,
      device failures, and secondary surgeries.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>ZCQ is a validated outcomes instrument specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, and captures data in 3 distinct domains: SS, PF, and post-treatment PS. SS Score is based on seven questions (overall pain, pain frequency, pain in the back, pain in the leg, numbness, weakness, and balanced disturbance) in ZCQ. The first 6 questions are scored 1 to 5. Balance disturbance is scored in a 1-3-5 scale. The SS score is the mean of all answered items in the questionnaire, ranging from 1 to 5. A lower score represents a better outcome/condition. If more than two items were missing, the SS score was considered as missing.</description>

        <title>Treatment Success Rate at 24 Months</title>
        <description>Treatment success rate is reported as the percentage of participants who met all of the following criteria:
Clinically significant improvement (by at least 0.5 points) in the Symptom Severity (SS) domain of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) compared to preoperative baseline
Clinically significant improvement (by at least 0.5 points) in the Physical Function (PF) domain of the ZCQ compared to pre-operative baseline
Patient satisfaction with treatment defined as a Patient Satisfaction (PS) score &lt; 2.5
No additional surgery for lumbar stenosis performed
Maintenance of distraction
No dislodgement of the implant
No device-related complications</description>

        <population>At 24 months, 94 subjects were evaluable for overall treatment success. Once subjects failed on additional surgery for lumbar stenosis or dislodgement of the implant or device-related complications, they failed at later visits no matter whether they had data or not.</population>

        <title>Symptom Severity (SS) Scores Measured by Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ)</title>
        <description>ZCQ is a validated outcomes instrument specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, and captures data in 3 distinct domains: SS, PF, and post-treatment PS. SS Score is based on seven questions (overall pain, pain frequency, pain in the back, pain in the leg, numbness, weakness, and balanced disturbance) in ZCQ. The first 6 questions are scored 1 to 5. Balance disturbance is scored in a 1-3-5 scale. The SS score is the mean of all answered items in the questionnaire, ranging from 1 to 5. A lower score represents a better outcome/condition. If more than two items were missing, the SS score was considered as missing.</description>

        <description>The Pfirrmann Grading System is descriptive and grades the status on an intervertebral disc as visualized with MRI using a 5-point system (grade I, II, III, IV or V). Grade I: disc is homogeneous with bright hyper-intense white signal intensity and normal disc height. Grade V: disc is inhomogeneous with hypo-intense black signal intensity and there is no more distinction between the nucleus and annulus, the disc space is collapsed. The percent of subjects with Pfirrmann grades increased from baseline at 60 months is reported.</description>
