  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if the expression of certain genes is
      linked with the response of cervical cancer to radiation. Researchers will study a large
      number of genes located in tumor material to learn this information.

      Patients in this study are already scheduled to begin radiation therapy. Researchers will get
      tumor cells by taking two biopsies of the cervix. The first biopsy of the cervical tumor will
      be done before any treatment is given. The second biopsy will be performed about 48 hours
      after the radiation treatment has begun. They will then study the cells in the lab with a new
      technique for studying gene expression called DNA array, as well as human papillomavirus
      (HPV) analysis, quantification of apoptosis levels, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and
      storage of tissue for future research.

      The patterns of gene expression in the biopsies will be compared with the success of
      radiation treatments.

      Some of the material will also be stored and used in the future for other research projects.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 18 patients will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at UTMDACC.
