    <textblock>
      GER and respiratory symptoms are both common phenomenon in children. Both can coexist in the
      same patient by chance alone. Research reveals increased incidence for both to coexist
      leading to suspect a temporal association and possible causality. Therefore we conducted an
      observational study To determine the primary cause (RS or GER)using for the first time both
      PH-Impedance as measurements of GER and Wheezy monitoring (WEEM) that records simultaneously
      wheeze and cough noises. Both modalities will be recorded for 12-24 hours. If GER precedes
      cough/wheeze recordings it points to GER being the possible precipitating factor and vice
      versa.

      cough/wheeze precedes GER recordings it points to cough/wheeze being the possible
      precipitating factor. The recordings will be investigated 1 minute before and one minute
      after each event.

        We studied 23 consecutive Difficult to treat infants and children suspected of suffering
        from both RS and GER with chronic respiratory symptoms. However, four dropted due to
        technical problems wiht the equipment. In 19 patients We fully analyzed the respiratory
        sounds one minute during and one minute before and one minute after each GER episode, and
        in all parental markings of cough.
