    <textblock>
      This study involves research to investigate how estrogen affects women of childbearing age
      and its correlation to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The findings from this study might help
      determine how body cells, called T Cells, react to estrogen. The study will seek to determine
      if cells from women with Lupus, react differently from cells in persons without Lupus. We
      will attempt to identify genetic factors that determine the effects of estrogen on Lupus
      cells.

      This is a 3-year study. The total number of subjects enrolled will depend on the results
      obtained. The subjects will be at least 18 years of age and pre-menopausal. Exclusion to
      include pregnant women, and all subjects are told not to get pregnant while on study. Also,
      they cannot take hormones by mouth or patch while on study. The study can include healthy
