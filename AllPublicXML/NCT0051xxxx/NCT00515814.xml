    <textblock>
      The outcome of this trial will reveal the possibilities of the retinal implant to improve the
      situation of patients with hereditary retinal blindness caused by degenerations of the outer
      retina. This pilot study will give important information on safety and efficacy of
      sub-retinal implants.

      Although the design of the chip with a possible resolution of up to 1500 image points has the
      potential of providing object recognition, the quality of the image transmitted in this first
      human application cannot be foreseen. On the other hand clinical experience teaches us that
      even bare light recognition improves mobility of patients because of the ability to localize
      bright light sources such as windows or lamps.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hereditary retinal degeneration of the outer retinal layers with the retinal vessels
             still being perfused and pigments of mild to moderate density

          -  Blindness (at least monocular) or visual functions not appropriate for
             navigation/orientation

          -  Period of appropriate visual functions &gt; 12 years / lifetime

          -  Visual acuity ≥ 0,05 in earlier life

          -  Electrically Evoked Phosphenes provide evidence of inner-retinal function.

          -  willing and able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other ophthalmologic disease with relevant effect upon visual function (e.g.
             glaucoma, optic neuropathy, trauma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment)

          -  Systemic disease that might imply considerable risk with regard to the surgical
             intervention and anesthesia (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, severe metabolic diseases)

          -  Neurological and/or psychiatric diseases (e.g. M. Parkinson, epilepsy, depression )

          -  Retina detected as too thin (&lt; 100 µm) to expect required rest-functionality as shown
             via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing, or women of childbearing potential who are not
             willing to use a medically acceptable means of birth control for the duration of the
             study, or women unwilling to perform a pregnancy test before entering the study

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the past 30 days
