  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug resistance to a range of antimalarial treatments has become widespread in Africa, South
      East Asia and South America. Because the rapid spread of drug resistance threatens a public
      health disaster in these areas of the world and to comply with the WHO-Roll Back Malaria
      policy of using Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), there is a need to develop
      new, safe, effective and affordable ACT.

      Chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CDA)is a new ACT that is being developed for the treatment
      of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Africa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presentation to a healthcare facility with probable uncomplicated clinical malaria

          -  Adults aged between 18 and 60 years , or children aged between 12 and 120 months

          -  Weight between 5 and 85kg

          -  Pure [on microscopic grounds] screening P. falciparum parasitaemia in children from
             25,000 to 100,000ul-1, or in adults from 10,000 to 100,000ul-1. [The parasitaemia
             range for adults was originally set at 25,000 to 100,000µl-1 and changed to 10,000 to
             100,000µl-1 in protocol amendment 3 dated 05 May 2004]

          -  Written or oral witnessed consent obtained from subject, parent or guardian

          -  Compliance with the requirements of the protocol which include a hospital stay of 4
             days and 3 nights and regular blood samples by finger-prick (children) or via a
             cannula (adults)

          -  A negative pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age on enrolment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Features of severe/complicated falciparum malaria

          -  Known allergy to sulphonamides

          -  Evidence of any concomitant infection at the time of presentation (including P. ovale
             and P. malaria)

          -  Any other underlying disease that would compromise the diagnosis and the evaluation of
             the response to the study medication (including clinical symptoms of
             immunosuppression, tuberculosis and bacterial infection)

          -  Treatment in the 28-days prior to screening with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (FANSIDAR,
             CELOXINE), sulfalene/pyrimethamine (METAKELFIN), mefloquine-sulfadoxinepyrimethamine
             (FANSIMET), chloroquine* (NIVAQUINE); treatment in the 21-days prior to screening with
             mefloquine, or 7-days prior to screening with amodiaquine, halofantrine, quinine (full
             course), atovaquone - proguanil, artemisinins, co-artemether, tetracycline or
             clindamycin, or treatment for 5 half-lives prior to screening with drugs that have a
             potential anti-malarial activity (e.g. co-trimoxazole in the previous 60 hours)

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to screening

          -  Previous participation in this study

          -  A positive pregnancy test at enrolment, women of child-bearing age who do not take a
             pregnancy test or female subjects who are breast-feeding an infant for the duration of
             the study
