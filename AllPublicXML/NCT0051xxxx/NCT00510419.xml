      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational auto-injector system for
      delivering sumatriptan under the skin for a single migraine attack.

      The study could take approximately 5 weeks and will include about 3 office visits to the
      study doctor, the patient will be contacted every 2 weeks until the patient experiences a
      migraine and uses the auto-injector. The last visit will be done by a telephone follow-up
      call.

      Investigational Plan:

        1. Screening Visit [Visit 0 / 0-14 days prior to receipt of study drug]

        2. Baseline Visit [Visit 1 / Provision of study drug and subject training]

        3. Treatment Visit [Visit 2 / within 72 hours after study drug administration]

        4. Follow-up Visit [Visit 3 / Telephone follow-up 7-10 days after study drug
           administration]
