  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) collected following stimulation with filgrastim are
      commonly used for autologous hematopoietic transplants. PBSCs are also now being used for
      some syngeneic and allogeneic hematopoietic transplants involving HLA-matched sibling donors.
      However, many issues remain unanswered about the use of PBSCs for allogeneic transplants and
      the effects of filgrastim on healthy individuals. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the effectiveness of filgrastim stimulated PBSCs in hematopoietic cell transplants involving
      unrelated donors and to determine the effects of this donation process on unrelated stem cell
      donors.

      This study establishes and evaluates a system to supply peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC)products for use in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The
      protocol describes processes for donor identification, education and evaluation. Procedures
      for administration and monitoring of the stem cell mobilizing agent filgrastim are included.
      The study also describes procedures for the collection of PBSC products by leukapheresis and
      includes provisions for indefinite donor follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Healthy adults

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or uninterruptible breastfeeding.

          -  Sensitivity to filgrastim or to E. coli-derived recombinant protein products.

          -  History of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic disease and thyroid disorders.
             Exception: As with bone marrow donations, donors with a history of thyroid disease who
             have undergone successful therapy may be suitable.

          -  History of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

          -  Thrombocytopenia &lt;150 x 10(9)/L (&lt;150,000/uL) at baseline evaluation.

          -  Current treatment with lithium. Drug interactions between filgrastim and lithium,
             which may potentiate the release of neutrophils, have not been full evaluated.

          -  Positive Hemoglobin-Solubility (e.g. SickleDex or equivalent) test.

          -  Donors receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents.
