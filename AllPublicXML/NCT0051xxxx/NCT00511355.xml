        <description>Blood glucose levels were determined as fasting values just before oral glucose intake and each half hour thereafter for 2 hours and again after 3 hours. Oral glucose tolerance was analysed using the (unadjusted) area under the curve over the 3 hours (AUC3). Incremental area under the curve was defined as incremental AUC3 = AUC3 - 3*fasting concentration. Each cycle consists of 28 days.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using diary booklets. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding/spotting was defined as any episode that occurred during the &quot;expected non-bleeding period&quot; that was neither an early nor a continued withdrawal bleeding. Expected non-bleeding period: NOMAC-E2: 21-day period starting on Day 4 of the cycle; LNG-EE: 21-day period starting on Day 1 of the cycle.</description>

        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Absence of Withdrawal Bleeding</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using diary booklets. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Absence of withdrawal bleeding was defined as no bleeding/spotting episode that began during or continued into the &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle; LNG-EE: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 6 cycles</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Occurrence of Early Withdrawal Bleeding</title>
        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using diary booklets. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Early withdrawal bleeding was defined as any withdrawal bleeding that started before the current &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle; LNG-EE: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 6 cycles</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT group consisted of all participants who were treated; ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.

        <description>Cycle control was evaluated on the basis of vaginal bleeding pattern as recorded daily by participants using diary booklets. Participants documented whether vaginal bleeding was present, and if present, indicated whether it was considered to be spotting or bleeding. Withdrawal bleeding/spotting was defined as any episode that occurred during the &quot;expected bleeding period&quot;. Expected bleeding period: NOMAC-E2: 7-day period starting on Day 25 of the cycle and ending on Day 3 of the next cycle; LNG-EE: 7-day period starting on Day 22 of the cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 28-day cycle for 6 cycles</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analyses of vaginal bleeding patterns were based on all participants in the ITT group who had at least one evaluable cycle. Cycles were considered to be non-evaluable in case of insufficient bleeding data or improper cycle length.
