      Evaluation of serial measurement of novel biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis or therapy
      monitoring in patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure.

      Background: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic and progressive illness resulting from a variety
      of cardiac causes, including ischemic and valvular heart disease, dilatative cardiomyopathy
      or hypertension. HF may also develop suddenly, particularly as a complication of acute
      myocardial infarction or as an acute exacerbation in patients with previously compensated
      chronic HF. Diagnosis and in-hospital management of HF is often demanding and outcome
      especially regarding rehospitalizations is impaired. Novel biomarker may be very helpful in
      assessment of diagnosis, prognosis, and severity of HF as well as for treatment monitoring.

      Design: Prospective, multicenter observational study Setting: University Hospital Basel,
      Kantonsspital Aarau, Kantonsspital Luzern, Kantonsspital Wolhusen Patients: Patients with
      acute HF not requiring ICU admission

      Measurement of serial biomarker (BNP, NT-proBNP, MR-proADM, ST2, hs-cTnI and Copeptin) will
      be performed at presentation, at 6 hours (h), 12h, 18h, 24h, at 48h, at day 6 and at hospital
      discharge. Follow- up will be performed at 6 Month, 1 year and 2 years.
