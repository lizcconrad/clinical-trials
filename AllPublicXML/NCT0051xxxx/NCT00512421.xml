  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of computer-assisted surgery by orthopedic surgeons experienced in the performance of
      total knee arthroplasty may result in better overall limb and implant alignment and fewer
      outliers as compared with the findings after manual total knee arthroplasty.

      The alignment results in previous studies were based on radiographic measurements. The
      sensitivity of radiographic assessment of limb and implant alignment may not be significant
      enough to distinguish small differences between computer-assisted surgery and manual
      techniques.

      It is possible that alignment differences that were too minor to be exposed on standard
      radiographs might result in long-term differences in the durability of arthroplasties
      performed with use of computer-assisted surgery or manual techniques.

      Moreover it is possible to measure additional implant positioning parameters with computed
      tomography (CT) technology.

      In this study, the investigators would like to add new method, for accurate measurement of
      implant alignment and to correlate its results with clinical data.
