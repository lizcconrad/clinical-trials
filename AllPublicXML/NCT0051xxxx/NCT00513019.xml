      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of Lamictal
      (lamotrigine) to placebo in neurotic excoriation. Thirty subjects with neurotic excoriation
      will receive 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with Lamictal (lamotrigine) or matching
      placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that Lamictal (lamotrigine) will be more effective
      than placebo in patients with neurotic excoriation. The proposed study will provide needed
      data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective
      treatment.

      The study will consist of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with Lamictal (lamotrigine)
      compared to placebo (1:1) in 30 subjects with neurotic excoriation.

    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Neurotic Excoriation (NE-YBOCS) was the primary outcome measure - severity of illness. The NE-YBOCS is a reliable and valid, 10-item, clinician-administered scale that rates buying symptoms within the last seven days, on a severity scale from 0 to 4 for each item (total scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores reflecting greater illness severity).</description>

          <title>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Neurotic Excoriation (NE-YBOCS) Will be the Primary Outcome Measure</title>
          <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Neurotic Excoriation (NE-YBOCS) was the primary outcome measure - severity of illness. The NE-YBOCS is a reliable and valid, 10-item, clinician-administered scale that rates buying symptoms within the last seven days, on a severity scale from 0 to 4 for each item (total scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores reflecting greater illness severity).</description>
