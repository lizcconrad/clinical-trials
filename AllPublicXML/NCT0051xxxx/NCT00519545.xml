  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help determine the biochemical mechanisms underlying previously
      demonstrated health benefits of prayer, and to track humoral changes in various prayer
      activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate certain biological mechanisms that may
      underlie the beneficial effects seen among cancer patients who pray. It will evaluate the
      effect of prayer on humoral (including biochemical/physiological inflammatory/immune)
      parameters, monitor changes in cancer related biomarkers and evaluate the effect of prayer on
      blood pressure, quality of life, health and dietary habits in relation to prayer activities,
      using validated questionnaires.
