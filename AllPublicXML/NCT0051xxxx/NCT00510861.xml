  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years, there is an increasing tendency to the parenthood delay in developed
      countries, and there is not enough information available regarding the influence of the
      male's age on fertility. If any, the negative impact should be acting at advanced ages.

      Our aim with this work was to determine the role of paternal age on IUI results embryo
      quality and IVF outcome. Evenmore, in order to standardize the female factor, good quality
      oocytes (from fertile oocyte donors) and only first IVF cycles in young women were
      considered.

      A retrospective study has been designed with a total number of 2204 IUI, 1286 IVF cycles and
      1412 IVF cycles with donated oocytes from 2000 to 2006.

      The inclusion criteria will be for IUI: women under 38 years old, tubal patency demonstrated
      by hysterosalpingography, normal uterine scan, normal basal hormonal levels, body mass index
      &lt; 27 kg/m2, and absence of polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis. For normal IVF
      cycles and oocyte donation cycles only first cycles will be analyzed. Cycles will be studied
      only in couples with absence of severe male factor.
