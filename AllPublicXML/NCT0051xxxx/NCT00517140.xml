  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of caesarean section has reached 15-20% in most developed countries.
      Encouraging vaginal birth after caesareans section (VBAC) has been considered a key component
      of a strategy to reduce the caesarean section rate. Most medical literature has focused on
      the efficacy of VBAC in reducing the caesarean section rate and the physical safety of
      successful VBAC. However, 30%-40% of these women fail to achieve a vaginal delivery. Little
      is known about how the uncertainty of labour outcome and a failed VBAC impact on the
      psychosocial function of these women. We propose to study a cohort of women with a prior
      caesarean section and presenting with a subsequent pregnancy for care. After consent and
      recruitment, these subjects will be randomly assigned to have a repeat caesarean section or
      VBAC. The medical outcomes, overall satisfaction of the subjects with the care they received,
      and the short-term psychosocial function of these subjects will be studied. The result of
      this study will provide important information that would be useful in assisting women to
      decide the mode of delivery after a prior caesarean section.
