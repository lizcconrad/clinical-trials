  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions are life saving in patients with surgical
      gastrointestinal diseases. However, the use of PN in pediatric populations, especially
      premature infants, is frequently associated with liver injury that may ultimately result in
      hepatic failure. In studies conducted in a murine model, we observed that intravenous fat
      emulsions (IFE) comprised of omega-3 fatty acids were able to prevent the development of
      cholestasis, a common precursor of PN-associated liver disease, as well as reverse
      preexisting PNALD through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance
      coupled with anti-inflammatory properties. In a case series treating patients with hepatic
      cholestasis, serum bilirubin levels decreased markedly after the parenteral administration of
      an omega-3 fatty acid based fat emulsion (Omegaven®). Patients tolerated this therapy and no
      adverse reactions attributed to its use were observed. Based on results of these previous
      studies, we propose to conduct a randomized trial aiming to gain preliminary evidence of
      efficacy of an omega-3 fatty acid based IFE in preventing PNALD in children with intestinal
      failure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether the use of
      an omega-3 fatty acid based IFE in infants with surgical gastrointestinal disease will
      improve clinical outcomes compared to infants treated with standard IFE up to 6 months post
      randomization. Neonates and infants &lt; 3 months old (postnatally) with surgical
      gastrointestinal disease (defined as congenital or acquired gastrointestinal disease
      requiring PN for more than 21 days) will be eligible for enrollment. Patients who meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive PN with either Intralipid® or
      Omegaven®. The appearance of both IFEs is indistinguishable, so patients, families and the
      medical care team will be blinded to treatment group allocation. Aside from the IFE type, the
      clinical care of both groups of infants will remain unchanged, including standard use of
      feeding advancement protocols, and treatment of underlying gastrointestinal and other
      diseases.

    <description>The definition of &quot;Presence vs. Absence of PNAC&quot; will vary with the post conceptual age of the child. In infants &gt; 40 weeks post conceptual age, we will define PN-associated cholestasis as four consecutive measurements (&gt; 6 days apart) of serum direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dL obtained over a 30 day period in the absence of other demonstrable etiologies of cholestasis. Due to hepatic immaturity, for infants &lt; 40 weeks post conceptual age, PN associated cholestasis will be defined as four consecutive measurements (&gt; 6 days apart) of serum direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dL obtained over a 42 day period.</description>
