      An open clinical trial to study the immune response and safety after giving a booster dose
      (5th Dose) of a combination vaccine against Diphteria-Tetanus-Pertussis-Polio to healthy
      adolescents 15-16 Years of age. The first three doses were given during the first year of
      life, according to the Norwegian child immunization program. The fourth dose was given in a
      previous clinical trial performed in 1998 when the children were 6-7 years old.

      In 2006 there was a change in the child immunization program in Norway: a fourth dose of a
      Combination Vaccine Against Diphteria-Tetanus-Pertussis-Polio is given to children 6-7 years
      old.

      This study will give us information if there is need for an additional dose (5th dose) of a
      combination vaccine, containing the pertussis components, before the adolescents are leaving
      secondary school.
