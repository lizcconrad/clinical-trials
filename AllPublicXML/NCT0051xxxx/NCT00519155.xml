    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring extraction of teeth with advanced intrabony periodontal defects at
             single rooted teeth without root concavities/furrows located in the maxilla and
             mandible (maxillary/mandibular premolars, maxillary incisors; presurgery probing depth
             ≥ 6 mm, intrasurgery defect depth ≥ 4 mm) or located the mesial or distal aspect of
             mandibular molar teeth without adjacent teeth (excluding defects also involving the
             furcation area).

          -  Teeth to be treated must be scheduled for extraction in a treatment plan established
             by clinicians unrelated to the study.

          -  Male and female patients, aged 18 - 75 years

          -  Patients must be non-smokers

          -  Female patients must be infertile (either sterilized or postmenopausal). If a
             patient's menopausal status at screening is uncertain, levels of follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) should be determined. Patients with an FSH level &gt; 25 IU/l and absence
             of menstrual bleeding &gt; 6 months will satisfy the definition of postmenopausal status.

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential, pregnant or lactating women

          -  Participation in another clinical study within 30 days prior to study start

          -  Previous participation in this study

          -  Legal incompetence or restricted legal competence

          -  Alcoholism, drug dependency, smoking

          -  Acute or chronic infection at the application site

          -  Known infection with HIV, HBV, or HCV

          -  Severe allergic rhinitis which requires permanent medication

          -  Known intolerance of or hypersensitivity to ß-TCP or rhGDF?5

          -  Presence of local or systemic malignant disease or history of local or systemic
             malignant disease in the past 5 years.

          -  Patients requiring chemo- or radiotherapy

          -  Previous or current radiotherapy of the head

          -  Chronic liver disorder (AST and/or ALT over 2 times upper limit of normal)

          -  Impaired renal function (creatinine over 1.5 times upper limit of normal)

          -  Uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt; 7%)

          -  Clinically relevant symptoms of thyroid dysfunction

          -  Severe hypertension (RRdiast &gt; 110 mmHg)

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease e.g., decompensated cardiac insufficiency,
             hemodynamically relevant heart valve defects, or myocardial infarction during the last
             three months

          -  Systemic bone disease or illness having influence in bone metabolism (e.g.
             Osteogenesis imperfecta, Paget's disease, Ehlers-Danlos disease, osteomalacia, renal
             osteodystrophia, hyperparathyroidism)

          -  Clinically relevant blood coagulation disorder

          -  Leukopenia &lt; 3.500 leukocytes/µL

          -  Previous (within last 2 months before screening visit) or current treatment with
             systemic corticosteroids of more than 5 mg/day prednisone equivalent

          -  Previous or current therapy with drugs having any influence on bone metabolism such as
             calcitonin or parathormone (as teriparatid) within the last 6 months before screening
             visit, bisphosphonates or fluoride at least for 30 days within the last 12 months
             before screening visit

          -  Previous (within last 2 months before screening visit) or current treatment with
             immunosuppressant
