      This pilot study will test the testing and exercise training protocols for a larger study
      that is in the desing phase and may be modified based on the findings of this study. Two
      exercise groups will be compared; one is a stadard treatment group using leg strength
      exercises that are commonly employed in therapy clinics. The other group will do balance and
      agility type exercises, but no specific strength exercises. These &quot;KBA&quot; exercises are
      increasingly common in therapy clinics, but very little research has been conducted on their
      effectiveness in treating knee osteoarthritis symptoms. Participants in this study will
      complete three short paper and pencil tests at the beginning and end of the study (8 weeks of
      exercise) as well as a leg strength test, a leg endurance test, two short walking tests, and
      a stair climb/descend test. One of the paper and pencil tests will be taken every two weeks
      in an effort to see how quickly changes to symptoms might occur. The exercise programs will
      be conducted 3 afternoons per week (Mon-Wed-Fri) and will be lead by an ACSM certified
      instructor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiographic knee OA is present in an estimated 37% of Americans over the age of 60,
      representing more than 13 million people. Current medical, non-surgical knee OA treatments
      focus primarily on symptomatic relief and have met with limited, temporary success. Various
      therapeutic exercise prescriptions have been used to help ameliorate knee OA symptoms and
      improve function. Leg strength training is most commonly used. However, recent evidence
      suggests that shorter programs of kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) techniques may
      result in more rapid symptom relief and functional improvements in comparison to traditional
      therapeutic exercise. These early benefits could potentially lead to greater long term
      exercise adherence.

      In a case study of an elderly female patient with dynamic knee instability related to OA,
      physical therapists reported success with a combination of KBA training and traditional
      therapeutic exercise. These findings need to be verified in a controlled clinical trial. This
      pilot study will help determine the proper testing and exercise training methods for a larger
      clinical trial, and will indicate if KBA training done without concurrent strength training
      is a viable intervention.

      Research Hypothesis: Among men and women age 50 and over with Kellgren and Lawrence (1957)
      Grade 2 or higher symptomatic tibiofemoral OA in one or both knees, an 8-week, 3-day per week
      kinesthesia, balance &amp; agility (KBA) exercise program - designed to increase dynamic
      neuromuscular knee stability - safely and effectively changes physical function more
      effectively than standard leg strength training

    <description>Participants will exercise three times per week 20 to 30 minutes per session. Agility/Active Range of Motion exercises provide warm-up, improve joint range-of-motion &amp; agility, dynamic proprioception,functional strength &amp; endurance.
Kinesthesia &amp; Balance Training will challenge the subject's proprioceptive and neuromuscular control mechanisms to adapt and stabilize the knee joints during dynamic ADL activities (walking, climbing, etc); improve static and dynamic balance and sense of stability &amp; confidence in ADL activities.
Soft pads will be used to progress some of the kinesthesia &amp; balance challenge training. Thera-Band® balance pads at 3 levels of softness will be used. These balance pads allow both appropriate starting difficulty and progression of difficulty level (i.e., the softer the pad, the greater the difficulty). Subjects will demonstrate safe balance on a stable surface (i.e. one-footed standing on floor) prior to progressing to the first level of the soft pads.</description>

    <description>Standard therapeutic exercises for knee OA which are widely used. Body weight and Thera-Band® color coded elastic bands will be used as appropriate to provide resistance. Exercises will be progressed according to the individual participant's improvement. All training for the ST condition will be conducted on stable surfaces (e.g. standing on floor, sitting in chair, lying on floor). Exercises may include 4-direction straight leg lifts, heel slides, quad sets, internal &amp; external hip rotation, heel raises, toe raises, knee extension, knee flexion, partial squats/wall slides, etc.</description>
