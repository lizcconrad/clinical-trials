  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate, whether a patient education with focus on pain
      coping is able to improve physical function and experienced pain level in patients with high
      levels of pain catastrophizing before Total Knee Arthroplasty. Resent studies indicates that
      these patients do not achieve a satisfactory pain relief and physical function after TKA.
      Furthermore, the aim is to determine if there is a difference in physical activity and muscle
      mass among patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing compared to patients with low
      levels of pain catastrophizing.

    <textblock>
      In Denmark, are approximately 8000 patients operated annually with Knee Arthroplasty. Most of
      these patients will have less pain and higher functional ability after the surgery. However,
      some patients respond poorly to the surgery and approximately 20% of the patients report
      persistent function-limiting pain six months or more following a total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA).

      Research has shown that patients with high pain catastrophizing scores are at higher risk of
      having persistent pain and lower physical function after the operation.

      This study consists of two parts. The first part is a randomised controlled trial where 56
      patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing before TKA are randomised to either
      treatment as usual (control group 1), which implies surgery and the standard postoperative
      rehabilitation, or in addition to this, a patient education focusing on pain behaviour and
      pain coping (patient education). In the second part the patients in control group 1 will be
      matched on age, BMI and gender with additionally 28 patients with a low levels of pain
      catastrophizing (control group 2).
