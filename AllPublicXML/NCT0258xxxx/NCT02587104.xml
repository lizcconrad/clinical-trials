      A single-centered, non-randomized study with approximately 20 subjects that will be seen for
      up to 12 weeks, each receiving the EpiFix plus standard of care. Safety and effectiveness
      will be monitored throughout the study.

      Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be seen for up to12
      weeks unless 100% epithelialization of the index wound and two subsequent healing
      confirmation visits have been achieved prior to week 12. Each subject will receive a weekly
      application of the EpiFix plus standard of care until 100% epithelialization is achieved. The
      subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety during the course of the trial.
