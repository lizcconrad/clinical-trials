      Study Design We conducted a non-blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of advertising prenatal portable obstetric ultrasound (pOBU) on uptake of
      antenatal care (ANC) services. This study design was selected to mitigate confounding
      variables and use the natural landscape of the region (described below), which is
      conveniently divided into geographically isolated but otherwise homogenous sub-counties, to
      our advantage.

      The study was conducted in Kabale District, a rural highland located in southwestern Uganda.
      It is roughly 560 km from the capital city of Kampala and has a population of approximately
      522,000. It is divided into three regions - north, central and south, and is further
      subdivided into 22 sub-counties, with 11 in the North, four centrally and seven in the South.

      Ethics approval was obtained from Lakeridge Health Corporation in the city of Oshawa, Canada
      as well as Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Mbarara, Uganda. The study
      protocol can be found at the following link:

      http://bridgetohealth.ca/study-protocol/

      Study Population All sub-counties of southern and northern regions of Kabale district were
      eligible for inclusion as a cluster in this study. This population predominantly engages in
      subsistence agriculture. There is very limited data describing the healthcare of this rural
      and isolated region, and it is believed that government statistics are often inaccurate. The
      Ugandan Ministry of Health, numerous non governmental organizations (NGOs) and other
      faith-based organizations provide for the regions' healthcare. Data suggests that uptake of
      any ANC services is close to 66%, with only one third of these women returning for a fourth
      visit or delivering in a healthcare facility (HCF).

      All women who were currently aware of being pregnant and presented to ANC were eligible for
      inclusion into the study. No pregnant woman who presented to clinic was excluded from the
      study. All patients provided written informed consent on a form developed in collaboration
      with the MUST ethics board. Many patients were illiterate or unable to read the consent form
      as it was written in English. A bilingual Ugandan midwife, translated the consent form and
      verbally explained its contents for each patient as they were checked into the clinic. It was
      clearly stated that any patient who chose to not engage in the research study would still
      receive full ANC care.

      Randomisation and Masking Twenty-two sub-counties were assessed for inclusion, of these 18
      were randomised to the intervention (n=4) or control group (n=4). The four sub-counties in
      the central region were intentionally excluded from the study design because they are
      primarily composed of urban and sub-urban communities and effectively divide the northern and
      southern regions. Four control sites (sub-counties) were randomly selected from the southern
      wing and four intervention sites were randomly selected from the northern wing. Selection of
      northern versus southern counties for intervention or control groups, as well as selection of
      which subcounties within each region and in which order they would be visited was all
      selected at random. Random selection was conducted by the statisticians at MUST using a
      simple random number program in MS-Excel.

      All eight sub-counties in the control and treatment arm received advertisement by word of
      mouth (WOM) regarding ANC. The control arm received no advertisement of pOBU. When consent
      was obtained in the control arm there was intentional masking of pOBU. Following completion
      of initial consent and an entrance survey all women were provided with a debriefing form
      explaining the presence of ultrasound, including communities where it had not been
      advertised, and again consent was obtained to participate in the research study. Any women
      who chose to not engage in the research study were provided with complete ANC services,
      including pOBU.

      Communities were randomly selected as stated above to receive messaging of pOBU. However, the
      control communities were chosen to be visited en bloc in the first four days, as opposed to
      alternating control then intervention on each day. This was done specifically to avoid
      contamination with radio messaging of pOBU, which was felt to possibly cross geographic
      boundaries. Sunday was intentionally avoided as a study day as most patients in the
      population ascribe to the Catholic faith and would not attend any clinics if held on that
      particular day.

      Intervention The intervention itself was advertising the availability of clinic and pOBU at
      the cluster level (sub-county). The initial study design had only two groups as described
      above in randomisation. However, the protocol was amended during the study due to interim
      analysis results demonstrating WOM advertising of pOBU was not successful in increasing
      uptake of ANC. It was hypothesized that the population was unable to spread this message as
      many did not know what pOBU was, and therefore could not relay the message. The intervention
      arm was subsequently modified to include radio advertising so that the message could be
      delivered more clearly and directly. This resulted in the following three distinct
      intervention groups: WOM advertisement of both pOBU and ANC (Intervention A), WOM
      advertisement of pOBU and WOM + radio advertisement of ANC (Intervention B), and WOM + radio
      advertisement of both pOBU and ANC (Intervention C). The radio message in Intervention C
      included the words &quot;You will be able to see a picture of your baby&quot;.

      All women attending clinic were offered pOBU delivered by a certified Ugandan ultrasound
      technician using single Nanomaxx unit with a C60n/8-5 MHz (11-mm broadband curved array)
      probe. Patients rotated through an ANC clinic that was based on the WHO guidelines for high
      quality ANC5 as well as the WHO four-pronged approach of elimination of mother to child
      transmission of HIV (EMTCT).

      Women received pre- and post-test counseling and rapid testing for HIV. Those who were
      positive were enrolled into the National HIV program and started on antiretroviral therapy as
      per national guidelines. Women were also offered intermittent presumptive therapy for
      malaria, rapid treponemal testing and treatment for syphilis, hepatitis B screening and
      syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections. Iron and folate supplementation was
      provided to all women. Any woman in active labour or with a critically low hemoglobin was
      transported to hospital by ambulance. Any woman with abnormal findings on ultrasound was
      referred for obstetric specialty follow up. All women were encouraged to deliver at a local
      HCF.

      Survey Women were questioned regarding their experiences and attitudes towards ANC and
      intentions to utilize a HFC both on entrance (before being debriefed regarding the
      availability of ultrasound) and after receiving the pOBU results. This was performed with the
      assistance of a bilingual Ugandan midwife. Data was collected using standardized electronic
      patient entrance surveys. The forms captured patient demographic and socioeconomic data.
      Patients were also asked if they were aware of the availability of ultrasound prior to
      arrival.

      Outcomes The primary study outcome was the rate ratio (RR) of total ANC clinic attendance
      between the intervention groups and control group. Secondary outcomes included A) the RR of
      attendance by women who had previously used a TBA, B) the RR of attendance by women who had
      not yet attended ANC, and C) the RR of total attendance between the three interventions.

      Statistical Analysis Sub-counties were chosen as the unit of allocation and number of women
      accessing ANC in each sub-county as the unit of analysis.

      The sample size calculation performed a priori was not utilized for this study as the design
      changed during implementation for reasons specified previously. We performed a post-hoc power
      calculation. We assumed that the distribution of pregnant women attending ANC was Poisson
      distributed. We assumed that the number of pregnant women in each community was equal (i.e.
      we assumed equal offsets for control and intervention arms). We assumed that over-dispersion
      is not present when conducting the power calculation (i.e. we assumed the Poisson mean is
      equal to the Poisson variance). Our goal was to test whether the ratio of the Poisson rates
      was equal to 1 (i.e. the rate of women attending ANC was equal in the control and
      intervention arms). Assuming a rate ratio of 2, we required 25 women attending ANC in the
      control arm and 50 women attending ANC in the intervention arm to achieve 80% power to reject
      the null hypothesis of equal rates of attendance. Assuming a rate ratio of 3, we required 10
      women attending ANC in the control arm and 30 women attending ANC in the intervention arm to
      achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal rates of attendance.

      Demographic data was summarized using simple descriptive statistics. We computed rates of ANC
      uptake, first ANC use and ANC uptake due to pOBU, respectively, and all at the cluster level.
      The count of the number of women attending ANC, for each specific outcome, formed the
      numerator of the rate. The ideal denominator for the rate calculation would be the number of
      women who were aware that they were pregnant during the study period. This denominator was
      unavailable so we used the number of women attending first ANC in 2013-2014 through
      government run clinics as a proxy. We expressed all rates per 1,000 women. Using Poisson
      regression, and Pearson's correction factor for over-dispersion, we tested whether the ratio
      of rates in the control and intervention arms were equal.

      We compared the estimated rates in each intervention group with the control group and also in
      each intervention group with other intervention groups (we computed all possible pair-wise
      rate ratios between trial arms). We chose to reject the null hypothesis of equal rates of ANC
      uptake at a 5% alpha level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4
      (Cary, North Carolina). Since the outcomes reported were at the health facility (cluster)
      level, no further special analyses to account for clustering were conducted.

      Role of the Funding Source The funding source of this study was the Canadian not for profit
      corporation Bridge to Health Medical and Dental (BTH). BTH is primarily funded through
      unrestricted donations from Canadian corporations (such as Cole Engineering, Lebovic
      Enterprises and other smaller donors), Canadian Rotary Clubs, and small private donors. None
      of the donors had any conflicts of interest. None of the Canadian investigators received any
      personal compensation for their work on this project. The organization has no proprietary
      holdings on the technology used in this study nor does it, or its investigators, receive any
      financial compensation for sales of portable ultrasound technology. Some compensation for
      time spent was provided by BTH to the Ugandan research team.
