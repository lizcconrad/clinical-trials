  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel is an early manifestation of amyloidosis in a significant minority of patients.
      This specimen collection protocol will allow the investigators to screen patients with carpal
      tunnel syndrome for amyloidosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess a high risk population of patients, those with carpal
      tunnel syndrome, and systematically assess them for Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and
      Transthyretin-Related Amyloidosis (ATTR) with simple laboratory blood tests. The combination
      of serum immunofixation electrophoresis together with serum free light chain (FLC) assay
      approaches 100% sensitivity for identifying the monoclonal protein underlying the illness in
      patients with AL amyloidosis. In addition to this, testing for transthyretin gene mutations
      will allow the investigators to identify patients with ATTR. The investigators believe this
      simple screening panel (serum immunofixation and serum FLC assay and transthyretin mutation
      analysis) may allow the investigators to identify patients early in the course of their
      disease, at which point the investigators can intervene with effective treatment and spare
      patients a significant amount of morbidity and mortality.
