    <textblock>
      The Copper intrauterine device is the most common method of reversible contraception
      worldwide. Abnormal uterine bleeding and pain are the most common medical indications for the
      discontinuation of the intrauterine device.

      Excessive prostaglandin release in the endometrial cavity appears to play an important role
      in both bleeding and pain related to copper intrauterine devices.There are many types of
      prostaglandin metabolites that present in the endometrium one of them is prostacyclin which
      causes vasodilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Another one is thromboxane which has
      two types; A2 which is active and rapidly converted into B2, which is inactive. Thromboxane
      causes vasoconstriction and blood clotting.

      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors acting
      by decreasing production of endometrial prostaglandins; they can improve both heavy uterine
      bleeding and pain. Since its discovery; several drugs in NSAIDs class have been used to treat
      heavy uterine bleeding and pain associated with copper intrauterine device use such as
      mefenamic acid, ibuprofen and naproxen.

      The most recent systematic review found NSAIDs is the most widely studied drugs for reduction
      of the menstrual blood and pain associated with copper intrauterine device. The Cochrane
      Review also found that NSAIDs are the most effective treatment to reduce the bleeding with
      copper intrauterine device use.
