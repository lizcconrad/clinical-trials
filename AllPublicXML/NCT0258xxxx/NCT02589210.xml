    <textblock>
      A single-centered, non-randomized study with approximately 20 subjects that will be seen for
      up to 12 weeks, each receiving the EpiFix mesh plus standard of care. Safety and
      effectiveness will be monitored throughout the study.

      Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be seen for up to12
      weeks unless 100% epithelialization of the index wound and two subsequent healing
      confirmation visits have been achieved prior to week 12. Each subject will receive a weekly
      application of the EpiFix Mesh plus standard of care until 100% epithelialization is
      achieved. The subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety during the course of the
      trial.
