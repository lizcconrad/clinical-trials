    <textblock>
      The Women's Ischemia Study Evaluation (WISE), a cohort study of over 1000 women, has made
      many contributions to the understanding of cardiovascular disease. A milestone acknowledged
      in the 2011 AHA Herrick Lecture is the role of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) in
      women with symptoms/signs of ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
      While in 1996, CMD was considered &quot;an imaging artifact&quot;, in 2013, it is a widely accepted as
      a pathophysiologic process requiring systematic cohesive scientific pursuit. CMD is
      prevalent, associated with adverse clinical outcomes, poor quality of life and healthcare
      costs rivaling obstructive CAD. There are 2-3 million US women with CMD, and 100,000 new
      cases projected annually placing CMD prevalence, morbidity and costs higher than all female
      reproductive cancers combined.

      Among women with ischemia, preserved ejection fraction and no obstructive CAD, it has been
      observed that there are relatively more new onset heart failure (HF) hospitalizations than
      nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). It has been hypothesized that CMD contributes to left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and subsequent heart failure with preserved ejection
      fraction (HFpEF). Preliminary data further suggests that left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction is linked to CMD via a mechanism of augmentation and/or perpetuation by
      cardiomyocyte fat accumulation. HFpEF is prevalent in women and older men, but poorly
      understood. Mechanistic understanding is critical to HFpEF intervention and guideline
      development.

      The study hypotheses are as follows:

        1. Risk factor conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, loss of estrogen)
           promote an inflammatory and pro-oxidative state making the microvasculature vulnerable;

        2. Vulnerable coronary microvasculature becomes dysregulated (sympathetic nervous system
           activation, endothelial dysfunction, changes in vascular smooth muscle activation,
           spasm) causing repeated episodes of transient ischemia;

        3. Repeated ischemia-reperfusion episodes facilitate preconditioning with preservation of
           cardiomyocyte contractile and microvascular function against ischemic injury;

        4. Ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning lead to cardiomyocyte fat accumulation and
           relaxation impairment resulting in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with
           preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

    <textblock>
      The current application will study new cohorts of women and men with the following specific
      aims:

      Specific Aim 1: LV diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD. Sub-Aim 1: LV diastolic
      dysfunction and CMD are linked via the mechanism of cardiomyocyte fat accumulation.

      Specific Aim 2: Comprehensive noninvasive Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) that
      includes LV diastolic function is linked with invasive measures of LV diastolic function and
      can optimize diagnosis of CMD.

      Sub-Aim 2: Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) can exclude obstructive CAD in CMD.

      Exploratory Aim: Blood proteomic and metabolomics biomarkers of extracellular matrix
      remodeling and fibrosis combined with ischemia measures will predict HFpEF.

      In this prospective, cohort design study, investigators intend to enroll 220 new subjects
      including 120 symptomatic women undergoing invasive coronary angiography for suspected
      ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as ≥50% luminal diameter
      stenosis in ≥1 epicardial coronary artery and 100 women and men hospitalized for Heart
      Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) defined by the European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC) criteria who have not yet undergone coronary angiography.

      New and existing samples and longer term follow-up will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion
      looking for potential HFpEF biomarkers for pilot data purposes.

      After baseline evaluation, the n=120 cohort will undergo noninvasive high resolution,
      comprehensive CMRI imaging, invasive angiography, coronary reactivity testing and rest-stress
      Millar pressure-volume measurement. Handgrip, mild leg exercise, and brief Valsalva Maneuver
      will be conducted during CMRI and Millar pressure-volume assessment to characterize cardiac
      response to stress. Lastly, these patients will also undergo MR Coronary Angiography, for
      validation purposes against gold-standard angiography.

      The cohort of 100 women and men with HFpEF admitted to the hospital who have not yet
      undergone coronary angiography will also undergo CMRI (with stress), including MR coronary
      angiography (CMRA) and noninvasive computed coronary tomographic angiography (CCTA)(CSMC
      only).

      This will provide understanding of a non-cath-lab based population regarding links between
      CMD, diastolic function and HFpEF, and will result in data to test the hypothesis that
      coronary MRA can exclude obstructive CAD and diagnose CMD without ionizing radiation.
      Proteomic and metabolomics biomarker assays in the (n=567) subjects with no obstructive CAD
      (Exploratory Aim) will be performed.

    <description>A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses x-ray imaging to see the heart's blood vessels; it is a part of Heart (cardiac) catheterization procedure. During a coronary angiogram, a type of dye that's visible by an x-ray machine is injected into the blood vessels of the heart. The x-ray machine rapidly takes a series of images (angiograms).
The Coronary Reactivity test (CRT), heart pressure (Millar) evaluation, and Millar stress testing are performed during the coronary angiography.</description>
