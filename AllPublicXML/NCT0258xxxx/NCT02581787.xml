    <textblock>
      The SABR-ATAC trial (Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and anti-TGFB Antibody Combination)
      is a phase I/II trial that studies the side effects and efficacy of fresolimumab, an
      anti-transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) antibody, when given with stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy in patients with stage IA-IB non-small cell lung cancer. Fresolimumab may
      inhibit radiation side effects and block tumor growth through multiple mechanisms.
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT), is a specialized form of radiation therapy that precisely delivers high dose
      radiation directly to tumors, thus killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal
      tissue. Giving fresolimumab with SABR may work better in treating patients with early stage
      non-small cell lung cancer than treating with SABR alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR) in patients. (Phase I) II. Evaluate the rate of radiation induced
      pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase I)
      II. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase I) III. Evaluate recurrence
      rates and progression free survival. (Phase I) IV. Assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      fresolimumab in combination with SABR (optional for patient). (Phase I) V. Evaluate the rate
      and severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase I)
      VI. Evaluate the severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus
      fresolimumab. (Phase II) VII. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving
      fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase II) VIII. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary
      function. (Phase II) IX. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of fresolimumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4
      fractions between days 8 and 12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed, histologically proven (or strongly suspected, see below) T1-T2aN0M0
             (Stage IA-IB) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with maximum tumor diameter =&lt; 5 cm
             under consideration for stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) as definitive
             primary treatment

          -  Pathologic confirmation of NSCLC diagnosis is recommended whenever possible; this will
             generally be accomplished using computed tomography (CT) guided or bronchoscopic
             biopsies; if pathologic confirmation is not possible, a target lesion must be a non
             calcified pulmonary nodule that is present on at least 2 imaging studies (can include
             simulation scan); the nodule must have increased in size or proportion of solid
             component on CT and/or show increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron
             emission tomography (PET) over at least 2 imaging studies

             immunotherapy) for the lesion under consideration of treatment

          -  No uncontrolled, inter-current or recent illness that in the investigator's opinion
             precludes participation in the study, including those undergoing therapy for a

             count [ANC] &lt; 1000/mm^3)

          -  No prior history of lung resection on ipsilateral side

          -  No prior history of multifocal adenocarcinoma in situ (ie, classic or pure
             bronchioloalveolar carcinoma)

          -  No prior history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

          -  No prior history of keratoacanthoma (well differentiated squamous cell skin cancer
             variant, often centrally ulcerated); history of basal cell cancer is allowed

          -  No contraindication to receiving radiotherapy and no known allergy to components of
             fresolimumab

          -  No pregnant or breastfeeding women; men or women of child bearing potential must agree
             to use an acceptable method of birth control (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy for at least 90 days after last study
             treatment (radiation or fresolimumab); all women of child bearing potential (last
             menstrual period within the previous 12 months and not surgically sterile) will be
             tested for pregnancy at pre-entry
