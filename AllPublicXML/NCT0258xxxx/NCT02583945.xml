  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to increased mortality and morbidity in
      patients after non-cardiac surgery. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
      (KDIGO)-guidelines recommend a bundle of procedures to prevent the occurrence of AKI: A
      protocol for the improvement of the hemodynamic situation and a standardized proceeding in
      hemodynamic monitoring, consequent avoidance of nephrotoxic substances, regular measurement
      of creatinine and urine output, as well as normoglycemia. The primary goal is to determine if
      the consequent application of the KDIGO-bundle leads to a prevention of the occurrence of AKI
      in patients at risk after non-cardiac surgery.

      All patients included in the study will be treated with the KDIGO-bundle (hemodynamic
      stabilization, avoidance of nephrotoxic substances, normoglycemia and measurement of
      creatinine in serum and urine output). 12 h, 24h as well as on day 2, 3, 5 and 10 after
      admission on ICU the occurence of AKI (according to KDIGO) will be assessed.
