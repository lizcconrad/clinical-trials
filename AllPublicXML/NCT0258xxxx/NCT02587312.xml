  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes
      may affect adolescent smoking behavior. In this study, the researchers will randomize
      adolescent (age 15-19) daily smokers to either receive VLNC cigarettes or normal-nicotine
      content (NNC) study cigarettes for three weeks following a one-week usual-brand baseline
      period. Participants will be instructed to smoke only those cigarettes. The researchers will
      conduct daily assessments of total cigarette use (both study cigarette and non-compliant use
      of usual brand cigarettes), craving, and withdrawal, weekly assessments of breath carbon
      monoxide (CO) levels, cigarette acceptability, risk perceptions of VLNC and NNC cigarettes
      and demand for usual-brand cigarettes, and pre- vs. post-use measures of nicotine and
      toxicant exposure. Overall, the project will help determine how VLNC cigarettes may affect
      real-world smoking behavior in adolescents, and illuminate the potential mechanisms through
      which these products may effect such changes. Such knowledge will contribute to the science
      base that may inform future policy decisions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  current daily smoking (1 or more cigarettes per day for the past 6 months or longer).
             Participants must meet a breath carbon monoxide criterion of 6 ppm or higher; if this
             is not met, urine cotinine levels, detected by a NicAlert cotinine screening device,
             must indicate recent smoking (level 3 or higher).

          -  Participants must speak and comprehend English well enough to complete study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current pregnancy

          -  Self-reported daily use of alcohol or other non-prescribed drugs (excluding
             marijuana).

          -  Participants who are seeking treatment for their smoking or who report that they
             intend to quit smoking within the next 30 days and have made a 24-hour quit attempt in
             the past year

          -  Participants who report current suicidal ideation on the MINI suicide subscale
             questions 4 &amp; 5 (&quot;In the past month did you have a suicide plan?&quot; and &quot;In the past
             month did you attempt suicide?&quot;), as well as participants who indicate that they have
             made a suicide attempt in their lifetime
