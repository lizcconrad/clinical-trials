      Combined subthalamic and Nucleus basalis Meynert Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's
      disease with dementia DEMPARK-DBS STUDY

      Indication: Parkinson's disease with mild to moderate dementia

      Primary Objective: To provide a proof of safety of combined bilateral subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) and basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) stimulation in treating levodopa responsive motor
      symptoms of Parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction in patients with advanced Parkinson's
      disease having mild to moderate dementia.

      Exploratory Objectives: To determine if additional NBM stimulation improves or slows
      progression of cognitive decline in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease having mild to
      moderate dementia

      Test Device: Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) Neuromodulation Vercise™ System. A
      neurostimulation device consisting of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), integrated
      rechargeable battery, two DBS leads, a splitter allowing to control four electrodes, surgical
      tools, and external devices (programming system, remote control, and charging system).

      Device Description: The Vercise™ system IPG is a multiple independent current controlled
      pulse generator. The system is identical in form factor and dimensions to the commercially
      available 22-cc Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation II IPG. To allow the delivery of
      stimulation pulses to four DBS electrodes with different stimulation frequencies (100-200 Hz
      at the STN and 20-80 Hz at the NBM) the splitter of the Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation
      system will be used.

      Study Design: Prospective single center Phase 1b study with double-blind randomized delayed
      activation of basal nucleus of Meynert neurostimulation (staggered onset design)

      Planned Number of Subjects: 12 patients

      Planned Number of Sites / Countries: Single center in Germany

      Primary Endpoint: Safety of combined bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and basal nucleus of
      Meynert (NBM) stimulation as determined by spontaneously reported adverse events.

      Health Economics Endpoints:

        -  Gain in quality adjusted life-years (QUALY)

      Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment: Eligible patients who consent to participation and
      have met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will receive all of the
      following settings in a pre-specified randomized order for NBM neurostimulation at visit 2 :

        -  sham stimulation settings at 0 V, 60 µs, 20 Hz

        -  test stimulation at settings of 60µs, 20 Hz and individually adjusted amplitude (could
           be additionally verified by GUIDE visualization tool) below the threshold of adverse
           effects

      Study Schedule:

        -  Screening (0 to 4 weeks prior to inclusion)

        -  Presurgical baseline evaluation (motor on and off state, cognitive testing in best motor
           on state) (0 to 4 weeks prior to surgery)

        -  DBS Implant Procedure

        -  Postsurgical baseline evaluation (motor on and off state, cognitive testing in best
           motor on state) at 4±1 weeks after surgery and activation of subthalamic
           neurostimulation using individualized stimulation parameters after a standard monopolar
           review

        -  Visit 1 (12 weeks after activation of STN neurostimulation): motor off/on-medication +
           STN stimulation state, cognitive testing in motor off + STN stimulation state

        -  Randomization and blinded activation of NBM neurostimulation according to a 1:1 scheme

        -  Visit 2 (24 weeks after randomization): motor off-medication ± stimulation state,
           cognitive testing in motor off + STN stimulation state ± NBM stimulation state

        -  Activation of NBM neurostimulation in all patients

        -  Visit 3 (48 weeks after activation of NBM stimulation - e.g. 24 weeks after Visit 2 in
           the NBM neurostimulation group vs. 48 weeks): motor off -medication ± stimulation state,
           cognitive testing in motor off + STN stimulation state + NBM stimulation state

        -  Annual follow-up visit for up to 5 years after activation of NBM stimulation Required
           Medication Therapy Patients must be on stable doses of antiparkinsonian and antidementia
           medications for at least 4 weeks prior to screening assessment. Medications and dosages
           may be adjusted as necessary after DBS implant surgery.

      Study Duration Duration of the entire trial: 2 years Duration of recruitment: 12 month
      Follow-Up: 9 month Statistical Analysis: 3 month Study start: 11/2015 Anticipated study end
      (final report): 12/2017 Duration of Treatment: 48 weeks

      Statistical Methods Primary Statistical Hypothesis Sample size considerations: Emre et al
      NEJM 2004 found a 2.1±8.2 point improvement on the ADAS-cog with rivastigmine treatment
      compared to a worsening of 0.7±7.5 points with placebo after 24 weeks (baseline 23.8±10.2
      points). There is currently no data to estimate treatment effect size and variability of NBM
      DBS. Clearly such small mean differences in combination with comparatively large standard
      deviations shown by the rivastigmine study are detectable with appropriate power only with
      sample sizes (2*125 = 250) far away from sample sizes planned for this study. But we hope to
      get hints to considerably larger effects for NBM DBS. Within a purely explorative analysis we
      will test the null hypothesis of equal mean ADAS-cog change scores from visit 1 to visit 2
      for both study treatments (STN-DBS + NBM-DBS versus STN-DBS + sham-DBS) by an analysis of
      covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline ADAS-cog as covariate. Assuming a small to moderate
      correlation between baseline ADAS-cog and ADAS-cog change score from visit 1 to visit 2 a
      sample size of 2*5 = 10 patients ensures a power of 84% to detect a standardized mean
      difference of 2.0 as significant deviation from the null hypothesis of equal mean change
      scores for both treatments at significance level 0.05. That means we are able to detect only
      very large effects as significant, but this is not the main objective of this pilot study.

      This study is exploratory to provide the necessary data for sample size considerations of a
      possible subsequent pivotal trial.
