      This study evaluates the use of brain activity monitoring for prediction of migraine attacks
      in an expected time scale of 12-48 hours prior to the migraine attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in one are. Participants diagnosed with migraine, will be
      evaluated for their EEG characteristics as well as daily migraine related clinical and
      general status. Participants' monitoring will be conducted for 20 times for a duration of one
      month.
