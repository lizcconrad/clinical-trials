  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a highly prevalent ocular disease with an increasing incidence in the
      elderly population. Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this
      disease.

      Relief of symptoms in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease is usually reached by
      the use of artificial tears during the day. Nighttime relief is often achieved by substances
      known to be more adhesive to the ocular surface, such as gels.
