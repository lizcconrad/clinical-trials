    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this study to build upon the results of a previous
      study which showed the Medial Pivot (MP) system required lower quadriceps activation than
      subjects implanted with a Posterior stabilized (PS) system preforming the same activities of
      daily living.

      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this study to build upon the results of a previous
      study which showed the Medial Pivot (MP) system required lower quadriceps activation than
      subjects implanted with a Posterior stabilized (PS) system preforming the same activities of

      Arthroplasty (TKA) design on muscle activation following TKA surgery.

        osteoarthritis Subject is a candidate to be implanted with the specified combination of
        components for either Group 1 or 2 Subjects are at least 45 years old and less than 76
        years of age at time of enrollment Subject is willing and able to complete required study
        visits and assessments Subject plans to be available through the 1 year postoperative
        follow-up visit Subject is willing to sign the approved Informed Consent document

        To be included in Group 3, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

        Subjects are at least 45 years old and less than 76 years of age at time of enrollment
        Subject is willing and able to complete required study visit and assessments Subject is
        willing to sign the approved Informed Consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

        Subject has both a body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference measurements greater than
        35.0 kg/m2 and 102.0 cm, respectively for men, and 35.0 kg/m2 and 88.0 cm, respectively for
        women at screening.

        Groups 1 &amp; 2 Only: Subject has degenerative conditions (other than osteoarthritis in the
        enrolled TKA) impacting joints of the lower extremities, previous joint replacement of the
        enrolled knee or any other lower limb joint replacement, or any other past or present
        condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may impact gait Group 3 Only: Subject
        has degenerative condition impacting joints of the lower extremities, any previous joint
        replacement in the knees, or any other past or present condition, which in the opinion of
        the Investigator, may impact gait.

        Groups 1 and 2 Only: Subjects with a Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale of ≥2 on the
        contralateral knee Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical investigation related
        to lower limbs, which could affect the endpoints of this protocol.

        substance abuse issues Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would
        pre-empt their ability or willingness to participate in the study Subject is currently
