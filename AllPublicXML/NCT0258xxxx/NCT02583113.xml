    <textblock>
      To determine if there is a patient satisfaction preference of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
      vs Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis
      who underwent a primary TKA one side and a primary UKA on the opposite side and are at a
      minimum of two years post-surgery. Patient reported outcomes and data with be analyzed along
      with all retrospective chart data.
