    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to further characterize the performance of L-PRP prepared using
      the Biomet Recover Kit in the treatment of chronic LE. The study will explore the potential
      impact of patient demographics and baseline characteristics on treatment outcome. Furthermore
      it will track and document treatment effects, time course, and untoward effects following
      treatment of chronic LE with L-PRP from the Recover device. In addition, the utilization of
      healthcare resources and associated costs will be investigated in treated patients.

      Clinical trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of Leukocyte- and
      Platelet-Rich Plasma (L-PRP) prepared with Biomet Recover L-PRP Mini Platelet Separation Kit
      for the treatment of tendinosis in a controlled setting. This study will allow for the
      capture and evaluation of real-world clinical data on a chronic LE patient population. The
      advantage of a post-market data collection is that it provides a way to examine clinical and
      patient reported outcomes along with the associated costs of chronic LE treatment in a
      diverse, clinically-relevant population. Although several registries exist which capture the
      outcomes following tendon/ligament reconstruction surgery, there are no known registries that
      capture outcomes following non-surgical treatment of chronic LE with Recover L-PRP. This
      study will fill that gap by allowing for an efficient data collection platform in a larger
      heterogeneous population of patients suffering from chronic LE and will document and more
      closely examine the treatment effects of Recover L-PRP.
