      This phase 1 study will be conducted to examine the degree and duration of brain PDE2A enzyme
      occupancy /target engagement as a function of TAK-915 plasma concentration in order to guide
      dosing and schedule for future clinical studies in schizophrenia with TAK-915.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-915. TAK-915 is being tested to examine the
      degree and duration of brain phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) enzyme occupancy/target engagement
      as a function of TAK-915 plasma concentration in order to guide dosing and schedule for
      future clinical studies in schizophrenia. This study will look at PDE2A brain enzyme
      occupancy in the putamen as a function of TAK-915 plasma concentration, as assessed using the
      positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [18F]MNI-794 after single dosing of TAK-915.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 patients in total and within that total, allow up to 5
      dose levels and up to 6 subjects per dose level. All participants will receive a single dose
      of TAK-915 on Day 1. The initial TAK-915 dose level to be studied is 100 mg. Subsequent dose
      levels may be lower or higher and will be determined through dose level review meetings
      (DLRMs) following approximately every 2 participants and based on prior occupancy, duration
      of occupancy, safety, tolerability, and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 55 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 22 days after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a known history or evidence of a clinically significant disorder (including
             neurologic and psychiatric) or disease that in the opinion of the study investigator
             would pose a risk to the participant's safety or interfere with the study evaluation,
             procedures, or completion.

          2. Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the standard MRI

             radiation therapy) within the previous year prior to Baseline imaging.

          4. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK-915 or related
             compounds, or to [18F]MNI-794 or to any of its components.

          5. Clinically significant abnormal findings on brain MRI scan or findings on brain MRI
             that may interfere with the interpretation of the positron emission tomography (PET)
