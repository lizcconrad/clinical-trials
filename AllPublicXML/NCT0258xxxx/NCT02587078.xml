      The primary alternative hypothesis is that less time (minutes) is required, to achieve the
      initial hemodynamic stabilization, with Volulyte® compared to Jonosteril®.

        -  H01: Minutes with Volulyte® ≥ Minutes with Jonosteril®

        -  H11: Minutes with Volulyte® &lt; Minutes with Jonosteril®

      Comparative, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized study.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria (at Screening, see below for definition) will be
      randomized immediately in a ratio of 1:1 to either receive intravenous Volulyte® or
      Jonosteril® for fluid resuscitation (on RAND). Fluid resuscitation with study drug will be
      started immediately in order to reach initial hemodynamic stabilization. Assessment of the
      effects of fluid resuscitation to achieve the primary and secondary endpoints will be
      performed up to 24 hours following the randomization.

      Initial hemodynamic stabilization is defined as normalization of mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or
      response to PLR (passive leg rising) as defined below and maintaining this normalization over
      a period of 1 hour, with no increase in the infusion of vasopressors, or inotropic therapy
      and with ≤ 250ml of additional study drug administration within this 1 hour. The
      normalization of the parameters MAP and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or PLR (passive leg
      rising) and ScvO2 is defined as follows:

        -  MAP: ≥ 65 mmHg

        -  ScvO2: ≥ 70%

        -  PPV: ≤ 12% (premise: sinus rhythm, no spontaneous breathing efforts and mechanical
           ventilation with VT: 5 - &lt; 6 ml/kg).

      If PPV is not applicable, response to PLR-manoeuvre is used (see below).

      ● PLR: &lt; 10% change in cardiac output (CO)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior written informed consent of the patient. If this is not possible, it will be
             necessary for the investigator to obtain initial informed consent according to the
             requirements. The legally authorized representative has to provide the written
             informed consent or in his absence a declaration for inclusion in an emergency
             situation is to be signed by a consultant physician who is not involved in the study
             and who is independent of the investigational team. If the patient dies following the
             inclusion in the clinical trial based on the consulting physician´s vote and no
             legally authorized representative is available / able to give informed consent, no
             additional informed consent will be needed and the consultant physician´s vote will be
             considered sufficient.

          2. Male or female patient aged 18 years or older

          3. Presence of severe sepsis defined as:

             least two years; or if of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             dipstick pregnancy test (if a test result is not available at the time of
             randomization, a patient may be randomized and treated initially, however, has to be
             withdrawn immediately from the study as soon as the test result becomes available and
             is positive).

          6. Known serum creatinine &gt; 300 μmol/L, corresponding to 3.4 mg/dL (if a serum creatinine
             value is not available at the time of randomization or an available value is older
             than 24 hours, a patient may be randomized and treated. If a creatinine value of &gt; 300
             μmol/L becomes available later, treatment with the study drug may be continued if the
             risk/benefit ratio for the individual patient is regarded as positive by the
             investigator.)

          8. Anuria lasting more than 8 hours (&lt;50ml urine output / 8 hours) despite fluid

          9. Requirement for renal support (either continuous or discontinuous techniques,
             including intermittent hemodialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration)

         13. Known co-morbidities: Hematologic malignant disorders, neutropenia (polymorphonuclear
             leukocytes [PMN] &lt; 500/mm3), proven liver cirrhosis, Aquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS) Expected requirement for concomitant cancer therapy (e.g.
             chemotherapradiotherapy or surgery) from randomization until Day 4 Requirement for
             concomitant cancer therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) from

             adequate fluid resuscitation, along with the presence of hypoperfusion abnormalities
             or organ dysfunction as defined by Bone et al., 1992. Patients receiving inotropic or
             vasopressor agents may no longer be hypotensive by the time they manifest
             hypoperfusion abnormalities or organ dysfunction, yet they would still be considered
             to have septic shock. Patients treated with low dose vasopressors are not excluded
             provided they are responsive to fluid resuscitation as demonstrated by an individual
             fluid challenge. Patients receiving norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine
             (adrenaline) at a dose &gt; 0.5 μg/kg/min or dopamine at a dose &gt; 15 μg/kg/min at the
             timepoint of Screening are not eligible for the study.

         17. Intracranial bleeding

         18. Any condition rendering a patient unsuitable for inclusion based on the treating
             physician´s discretion
