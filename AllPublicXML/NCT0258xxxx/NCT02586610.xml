      This is a phase II, prospective open label multi-center study in which subjects with stage
      II-III rectal cancer will be accrued in order to determine the pathological complete response
      rate of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiation treatment (CRT).
      Subjects must have a diagnosis of rectal cancer, stage II (T3-4, N0) or stage III (any T,
      N1-2). Subjects must have received no prior treatments (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation or
      surgery) for their rectal cancer.

      Eligible subjects will receive standard chemoradiation with pembrolizumab administered every
      3 weeks on days 1, 22, and 43 of the neoadjuvant interval. In all subjects, restaging
      endorectal or pelvic MRI with chest and abdominal CT will be performed at 6-8 weeks after
      completion of neoadjuvant treatment to determine resectability and to rule out any evidence
      of metastases. Subjects who have resectable disease will undergo surgery within 2-4 weeks of
      imaging; 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Subjects who are found to have
      unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab
      should receive standard of care definitive treatment per the discretion of their treating
      physician.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

      All subjects will receive concurrent chemoradiation and pembrolizumab neoadjuvant treatment
      for 6 weeks:

        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg Intravenously (IV) Days 1, 22 and 43

        -  Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO (by mouth) in twice daily doses (daily total 1650 mg/m2) on 5
           consecutive days / week Monday-Friday given on the radiation days for 28 days

        -  Radiation 50.4 Gy (Gray) in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy over a 6 week interval,excludes
           weekends

      POST NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

        -  End of treatment (EOT) 6-8 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, all subjects
           will be assessed to determine resectability. Those with resectable disease will undergo
           surgery within 2-4 weeks of imaging, 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.
           Subjects who are found to have unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with
           the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab should receive standard of care definitive
           treatment per the discretion of their treating physician.

        -  Surgical Resection ( 2-4 weeks after restaging imaging and 8-12 weeks after completion
           of chemoradiation)

        -  Follow Up

        -  Post Operative Visit (4-6 weeks after surgery)

        -  Disease Follow Up -Years 1-2 (per site investigator discretion; suggested every 3-6
           months)

        -  Survival Follow Up - Years 3-5

      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 7 days
      of treatment initiation:

      Hematological:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL

        -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL

        -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days
           of assessment)

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR

        -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine
           levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in
           place of creatinine or CrCl

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

        -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) / Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X
           ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

        -  Albumin ≥2.5 mg/dL

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject
           is receiving anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of
           intended use of anticoagulants)

        -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving
           anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use

             with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Serious uncontrolled medical disorder that in the opinion of the site investigator
             would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy.

          -  Unable or unwilling to participate a study related procedure, including MRI.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
