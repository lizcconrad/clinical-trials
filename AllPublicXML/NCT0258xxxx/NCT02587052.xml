    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective analysis of two different cohorts of patients that has undergone
      renal transplantation. This is a matched pair analysis of 100 patients treated with generic
      tacrolimus that will be compared with 100 matched controls treated with Prograf. Data will be
      obtained from patients' charts, from the Swedish National Kidney Registry and from a local
      registry at Transplantationscentrum. Patients included in the study are patients receiving a
      first single kidney transplant from a deceased or a living donor, treated with Prograf or
      Tacni and transplanted between transplanted January 2012 and August 2014. The 1-year-outcome
      of patients following renal transplantation, including BPAR, serious adverse effects and
      graft survival will be analysed.

        It is a retrospective analysis of two different cohorts of patients that have undergone
        renal transplantation at Transplanationscentrum in Gothenburg, Sweden. Approximately 100
        patients treated with generic tacrolimus will be compared with 100 matched controls. The
        controls will be selected among 200 patients that are treated with Prograf. The matching
        will be based upon living/deceased, age of the donor, age of the patient and number of
        previous transplantations.
