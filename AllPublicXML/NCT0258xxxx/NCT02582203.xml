  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multi-center trial of
      ceftaroline versus vancomycin for the treatment of ABSSSI in patients documented or at risk
      for MRSA. Patients admitted to the Detroit Medical Center, Henry Ford Hospital, or St. John
      Medical Center in Detroit Michigan with a documented ABSSSI between April 2012 and November
      2015 will be evaluated for inclusion. Patients must present with at least 3 of the following
      local signs/symptoms: pain, tenderness, swelling erythema, warmth, drainage/discharge,
      induration, and lymph node swelling/tenderness. Patients will be randomized 1:1 ceftaroline
      or vancomycin with optional anaerobic and/or Gram-negative coverage. The assignment of study
      drug will follow a randomized list that was previously generated via a computerized random
      mix block generator (nQuery AdvisorÂ® 7.0) and available at each of the study sites. Patients
      will be randomized to ceftaroline intravenously at 600 mg infused over 1 hour every 12 hours
      for patients with normal renal function. Patients randomized to vancomycin will receive the
      standard 15 mg/kg dose based on total body weight infused over 1 hour q 12 hour, dose and
      interval adjusted based on creatinine clearance and via institution-specific pharmacy
      protocol to target serum trough concentrations of 10-20 mg/L within the first 72 hours.
      Outcomes measured in the Clinically Evaluable patient population include day two or three
      size reduction (percentage) and clinical response at end of therapy or discharge.
