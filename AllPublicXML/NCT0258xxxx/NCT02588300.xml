    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional cohort study of drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE).
      The goal is to evaluate the upper airway in a cohort of patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) diagnosed in a prior polysomnography.

      This study correlates the sedation level measured by entropy during DISE using propofol via a
      TCI pump with the local obstruction patterns of the upper airway according to the VOTE
      classification.

      As OSAHS is a widespread disease and the DISE procedure has become a common tool for
      diagnosis and evaluation of further treatment, a growing number of research articles deal
      with this topic. These articles are available through pubmed.
