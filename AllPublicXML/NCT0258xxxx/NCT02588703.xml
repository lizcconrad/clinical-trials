      The current study evaluates the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in DUI
      programs for individuals with a first-time offense. Investigators will utilize a two-group
      randomized design where individuals enrolled in a DUI program with a first-time conviction
      will be randomized to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; n=150) or Usual Care (UC; n=150).
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 6-months
      post-treatment. Recidivism data will also be collected using administrative data two years
      post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enormous unmet needs for alcohol treatment exist among individuals convicted of driving under
      the influence (DUI) since up to 43% recidivate and 67% meet criteria for alcohol dependence.
      Investigators will test whether delivering a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for alcohol
      use disorders (AUDs) as part of a mandated DUI program improves health outcomes, and reduces
      alcohol use, alcohol-related problems and injuries, and DUI recidivism compared to usual
      care. The study has the potential to promote the public welfare by providing treatment to
      individuals with a DUI conviction, while focusing on Latinos, who are disproportionately less
      likely to access treatment and more likely to be arrested for a DUI, to have higher rates of
      recidivism, and to die in alcohol-related crashes than their white counterparts. The study is
      innovative because it would be the first to address effectiveness of treatment for AUDs
      embedded within a DUI program. Investigators will conduct a randomized trial of a 9-session
      group-based CBT (n=150) as compared to group-based usual care (UC; n=150) immediately after
      and 6 months after the end of treatment. Short-term outcomes include alcohol use (rates of
      heavy drinking, percent days abstinent), alcohol use-related self-efficacy, and intent to
      drink and drive. Investigators will also examine whether race/ethnicity, gender,
      acculturation, and alcohol situational norms predict our primary treatment outcomes (rates of
      heavy drinking, percent days abstinent) and DUI recidivism (alcohol-related violations).
