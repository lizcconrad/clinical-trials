  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether Peg-IFN beta-1a improves the
      satisfaction of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) participants unsatisfied with
      injectable subcutaneous Interferons, as measured by the Abbreviated Treatment Satisfaction
      Questionnaire to Medication (TSQM-9), at 12 weeks. The secondary objectives of this study are
      to evaluate in this study population: effects of Peg-IFN beta-1a treatment on participants'
      satisfaction at 24 weeks; effects of Peg-IFN beta-1a treatment on short-term participants'
      adherence; effects of Peg-IFN beta-1a treatment on participants' fatigue; effects of Peg-IFN
      beta-1a on disease activity and physical disability; impact of Peg-IFN beta-1a treatment on
      participant-reported health-related quality of life; impact of Peg-IFN beta-1a treatment on
      participants' injection-system satisfaction; Evaluate the relationship between participants'
      satisfaction and adherence; Evaluate the relationship between participants' satisfaction and
      social-demographic factors (age, sex, employment working, level of education, etc) and
      clinical characteristics (annualized relapse rate [ARR], disability, etc.) and to evaluate
      the treatment safety and tolerability.

    <measure>Changes from baseline in the score of convenience satisfaction domain of TSQM-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM Version 1.4 is a 14-item consisting of four scales: the effectiveness scale (questions 1 to 3), the side effects scale (questions 4 to 8), the convenience scale (questions 9 to 11) and the global satisfaction scale (questions 12 to 14). The TSQM-9 domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in the score of FSS (Fatigue Status Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This is a specific questionnaire composed of 9 statements on the state of fatigue during the previous week. The answers are within a scale of agreement ranging from 1 to 7, with 1 representing the lowest level of agreement. An overall score of ≥36 indicates a state of fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the score of Adapted Sclerosis Treatment Concerns Questionnaire (MSTCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MSTCQ is a validated 20-item participant questionnaire developed to address participant concerns with IFN-beta treatment that are not related to efficacy. It has two domains: injection-system satisfaction and side effects. All questions in the MSTCQ have a 5-point response choice, with lower total scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the score of Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life questionnaire (MusiQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>MusiQoL version 5.2 is a multi-dimensional self-administered questionnaire consisting of 31 items describing nine dimensions of health-related quality of life. The nine dimensions assess many aspect of QoL that are specific to MS participants (activities of daily living, psychological wellbeing, symptoms, relationship with friends, relationship with family, sentimental and sexual life, coping rejection, relationship with healthcare system). All of the 9 dimensions and the global index are linearly transformed and standardized on a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better QoL.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
