  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer is
      increasing probably due to the prolonged life expectancy and a variety of environmental
      factors. Fortunately, breast cancer outcome and survival are improving due to early detection
      and new treatment modalities. After making first strides against breast cancer, i.e.
      undergoing ablation surgery, most breast cancer survivors still have to go through a series
      of chemotherapy, which could prolong their survival but almost inevitably downgrade their
      quality of life due to grueling side effects, such as lack of energy and vulnerability to
      infection. Numerous medical interventions have been tried by healthcare providers to
      alleviate these side effects, but some of them are expensive and therefore become another
      burden for the cancer-afflicted patients. Previous studies have already indicated that
      exercise generated long-term benefits to breast cancer survivors, including improved physical
      functions, elevated maximal oxygen intake, decreases in lethargic symptom, increase in both
      immune function and quality of life. Among a variety of exercises, walking is the least
      costly, easy-to-follow type. Through a simple, predesigned walking regimen, the investigators
      expected that the breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy could cost-effectively reap
      some benefit either physically or psychologically.

      Cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3+), presenting at all stages of T-cell development, is a
      useful maker to identify T-cells. (Cluster of differentiation 4)CD4+ T cells, also known as T
      helper cells, play an assistant role in the immunologic process, such as maturation of B
      cells, activations of macrophages or cytotoxic T cells. Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T
      cells, known as cytotoxic T cells, responsible for destroying virus-infected cells and tumor
      cells. Generally, the counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells could be a
      reflection of immune system health. Short-Form 36(SF-36), a patient-reported survey, is a
      widely adopted tool to evaluate patient's individual health status. By means of serial blood
      sample collections and the delivery of SF-36 survey, this study aimed to objectively and
      quantitatively evaluate the effects of aerobic walking on the breast cancer patients
      undergoing chemotherapy.

    <description>For the exercise group, subjects were asked to follow a simple walking regimen. Walk normally with stable and comfortable stride rates during their exercise. The duration and frequency was initiated at a 30-minute or more daily exercise at least five days per week and gradually increased to a maximum of 60 minutes within subject's comfort zone.</description>
