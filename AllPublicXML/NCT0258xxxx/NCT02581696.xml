      A phase 1 study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction and safety of Lafutidine and
      Irsogladine maleate in healthy adult volunteers. Subjects judged to be appropriate to this
      study by screening before 28days of first administration. Subjects administrate Lafutidine
      bid during period I. After wash-out period, administrate Irsogladine maleate qd during Period
      II. After than, coadministration Lafutidine bid and Irsogladine maleate qd.

          2. Male subjects whose weight is greater than 55kg Female subjects whose weight is
             greater than 50kg and within ±20% range of ideal body weight.

             Ideal body weight(kg) = (Height(cm) - 100) * 0.9

          3. For female subjects must show negative for urine pregnancy test and also must meet one
             of the below listed criteria:
