  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to examine whether long-term dietary supplementation (8
      weeks) of an oat flour cookie rich in avenanthramides (AVA) could enhance blood antioxidant
      capacity and reduce blood inflammatory markers after a downhill running (DR) protocol among
      human subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Male and female non-obese subjects (18kg/M2&lt;BMI&lt;28kg/M2) (age 20-45 years) will be
        recruited from the Twin Cities community. All participants will sign informed consent
        approved by UMN-IRB and are willing to avoid oat consumption and rigorous physical activity
        the day prior to and through test and to consume a low-polyphenol diet for 1 week prior to
        the study. The foods rich in polyphenols include all berries, apples, pears, citrus fruits,
        fruit juices, onions, chocolate, wine, coffee, tea, beans, nuts, soy products and most
        spices

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of GI conditions that interfere with absorption;

          2. Clinically significant endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic,
             pancreatic, biliary or neurologic disorders;

          3. Major trauma or surgery within 3 months of visit;

          4. Cancer in the prior 2 years;

          5. Allergic to oat products;

          6. Women who are pregnant or lactating;

          7. Smoking;

          8. Drinking alcohol &gt;5 drinks/week;

          9. Using nutraceuticals;

         10. Blood pressure medication;

         11. NSAID (&gt;800 mg ibuprofen/week)

         12. Vitamin supplementation

         13. Anticoagulants or hypoglycemic drugs

         14. Oat products consumption and rigorous physical activity the day before the test and
             consumption of a high-polyphenol diet in week prior to the test.

         15. Moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥30 min•d−1 on ≥5 d•wk−1
             for a total of ≥150 min•wk−1, vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training
             for ≥20 min•d−1 on ≥3 d•wk−1 (≥75 min•wk−1), or a combination of moderate- and
             vigorous-intensity exercise to achieve a total energy expenditure of ≥500-1000
             MET•min•wk−1
