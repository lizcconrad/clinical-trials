    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment in subjects with BCC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7)
      10% Ointment topically applied twice daily for 28 consecutive days in male and female
      patients with BCC; and to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active
      pharmaceutical ingredient (total sheep Immunoglobulin G [IgG]) when BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10%
      Ointment is applied twice daily to BCC lesions. This was an open-label, single-arm,
      multicenter Phase 1 study that enrolled 21 BCC patients.

    <description>Adverse events and any changes in physical examinations will be monitored, as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 312. In particular local cutaneous irritation including erythema, peeling, dryness, itching, and burning/ stinging that first occur during the study or represent a worsening from Baseline will be recorded as AEs.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics - Measure Serum Concentration of Total Sheep IgG Using an ELISA.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine PK, blood levels of sheep IgG were measured in samples collected at Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 5, predose at Visit 6 (EOT), and then at 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after the last dose of study medication.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics - Measure Subject Antibody Response to the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Using an Indirect Fluorescent Immuno Assay.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The active ingredient of BSCT is sheep IgG which may causes an immunogenic response if it enters the systemic circulation. To monitor this response patient blood samples collected at Screening, Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 6 (EOT), and at Visit 8 (EOS) was tested for anti-sheep IgG antibodies (indicative of immune response against API).</description>

    <description>The study product BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment was anti-nf-P2X7 (highly purified sheep IgG) in an ointment formulation for topical administration. The formulation contained 10% weight by weight of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in an anhydrous ointment base.
Fifty (50) to 100 mg of product (an amount the size of a small pea) was applied topically twice a day for 28 days to a 25 cm2 area of skin containing a single BCC lesion. The product was to be applied in the morning and in the evening after washing.</description>

             a study within 4 weeks of the Baseline visit;
