  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) following thoracic surgery remains a major source of morbidity and
      mortality after lung resection. One-lung ventilation (OLV) is usually required in thoracic
      surgery. OLV is also an important predictor of postoperative ALI. Recent laboratory findings
      suggested that tissue hypoxemia and ischemia / reperfusion injury of the collapsed lungs
      during OLV is the major cause of lung injury. Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC), which is the
      exhalate from breath typically collected by cooling device, contains most molecules found in
      the airway. Metabolomics refers to systematic and scientific study of chemical processes
      involving metabolites. This study will collect EBC for metabolomic analysis and aim to
      elucidate the biochemical reactions during one-lung ventilation and pathological mechanisms
      of acute lung injury following thoracic surgery.

      Acute lung injury (ALI) following thoracic surgery remains a major source of morbidity and
      mortality after lung resection. Despite the advancement in both the surgical techniques and
      the perioperative management, the incidence of postoperative ALI remains remarkable. Risk
      factors for postoperative lung injury are evident, including preoperative pulmonary function,
      type of surgical procedure, intraoperative fluid management, one-lung ventilation, and
      ventilator settings. One-lung ventilation (OLV) is usually required in thoracic surgery. OLV
      is also an important predictor of postoperative ALI. Recent laboratory findings suggested
      that tissue hypoxemia and ischemia / reperfusion injury of the collapsed lungs during OLV is
      the major cause of lung injury. Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC), which is the exhalate from
      breath typically collected by cooling device, contains most molecules found in the airway.
      EBC analysis has potential applications in lung disease, such as severity of airway
      inflammation in asthmatic patients. Collecting EBC is simple and non-invasive, in contrast to
      bronchoscopy for lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage. Metabolomics refers to systematic and
      scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites. This study will collect EBC
      from thoracic surgical patients before, during, and after OLV. The investigators will perform
      metabolomic analysis and aim to elucidate the biochemical reactions during one-lung
      ventilation and pathological mechanisms of acute lung injury following thoracic surgery.
