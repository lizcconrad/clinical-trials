      This study will compare the effects of brief strengths-based case management (SBCM) to the
      effects of screening, assessment and referral alone (SAR) in opioid-dependent patients.
      Participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence will be randomly assigned (150 per
      group) to receive 1) up to 6 sessions of SBCM; or 2) SAR. Follow-up assessments will be
      completed at 3 and 6 months, by staff who are blinded to treatment condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As addiction treatment becomes increasingly integrated into the medical care system, two
      models have rightly received a great deal of attention. The first is the use of Screening,
      Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) models to identify cases, provide
      therapeutic contact, and refer the more severe cases to longer-term care. The second is the
      treatment of addictions using medical models of treatment, including those that can be
      implemented in primary care settings. Much less attention has been paid to optimizing
      strategies for bridging the gap between SBIRT and more intensive/longer-term treatment for
      those on the severe end of the spectrum. This factor is of critical importance for opioid
      dependent patients, whose needs are not met by brief interventions or brief treatment.
      Emergency room interventions for substance use disorders have been largely limited to brief
      interventions/SBIRT models, and these have focused primarily on alcohol. Although there is a
      substantial literature documenting the value of case management in linking drug users to
      treatment, this approach has not been applied to drug users in the emergency department (ED)
      setting.

      In a sample of opioid dependent patients seen in a medical ED who are not currently engaged
      in treatment, this study will compare the effects of brief strengths-based case management
      (SBCM) to the effects of screening, assessment and referral alone. Participants meeting
      DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence will be randomly assigned (150 per group) to receive 1)
      Screening, Assessment and Referral or 2) up to 6 sessions of SBCM based on the model
      previously implemented by Rapp and colleagues in prior studies. Staff who are blinded to
      treatment condition will complete follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. Aims of the study
      are to identify the main effects of SBCM on substance abuse treatment initiation and
      engagement, use of opioids and other drugs, and broader measures of health and life
      functioning; to examine the interactions between treatment assignment and selected
      participant attributes in predicting treatment initiation, engagement, and substance use
      outcomes; and to examine effects of treatment involvement on substance use outcomes in the
      two treatment groups.

      The proposed study will be the first trial using a case management approach to link drug
      dependent patients presenting in EDs to longer-term addiction treatment. It will be one of
      the first trials focusing specifically on opioid dependent patients in medical EDs. A further
      innovative feature is that the case management approach will emphasize linkage to
      pharmacotherapy, facilitating linkage to office-based buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone
      for patients who desire this treatment.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by an a priori pairwise contrast (SBCM vs. SAR). &quot;Initiation&quot; will be defined as a dichotomous outcome (yes/no), and will be considered to have occurred if patients report any substance abuse counseling sessions (excluding SBCM) from the time of the baseline assessment up to the day before the three-month interview. Using the same timeframe as &quot;initiation,&quot; &quot;engagement&quot; will be defined as the number days of medication use for opioid dependence, based on self-report verified by clinic dosing logs and Prescription Drug Monitoring Program records. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) will be used to test the planned contrasts, with group assignment as the between-subject factor, and baseline measures of days substance use, number of lifetime treatment episodes for substance misuse, and readiness for change used as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Opioid and other substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be based on a yes/no measure of &quot;successful outcome.&quot; &quot;Successful outcome&quot; will be defined as 1) 3-month urine negative for opioids (opiates, oxycodone, methadone, buprenorphine, or propoxyphene) unless prescribed for opioid dependence, and 2) no more than two days of self-reported opioid use in the 4 weeks prior to the 3-month evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Initiation and engagement in participants with higher levels of environmental instability at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Environmental instability at baseline will be defined by summing five items in the Form 90 interview, with higher scores reflecting more instability: number of days homeless, days living with others (not paying rent), days living in a halfway house, days incarcerated, and days not paid for work (all past 30 days).</description>

    <description>The structure of SBCM follows the widely accepted functions of case management—assessment, planning, linking, monitoring and advocacy—and the theory-driven gestalt of the strengths perspective. Strengths-based principles include an emphasis on client strengths, teaching clients a method for setting and completing goals, and development of a strong working alliance.</description>

    <description>The six case management sessions for the proposed trial are based on those described in manuals developed by Dr. Rapp for two clinical trials, one supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and another by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Each session is guided by specific objectives that promote linkage with and retention in substance abuse treatment, particularly pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence in a specialty or primary care setting. Objectives from the earlier trials will be adapted to fit the specific context of this trial, linking with and staying in treatment following an emergency department visit. Initiation of the relationship between client and case manager begins immediately following random assignment and termination takes place when either (1) six sessions have occurred; (2) ninety days have elapsed; or (3) clients discontinue involvement.</description>

    <description>The research assistant will provide these participants with an information sheet listing treatment (including both specialty treatment centers and primary care clinics that provide buprenorphine) and self-help resources in their community. The referral sheet includes names, addresses, and phone numbers of local addiction treatment agencies. Because the emergency department does not currently screen or refer systematically, the SAR condition represents a level of care significantly higher than &quot;treatment as usual.&quot; Participants will also receive an informational pamphlet about drug use and its consequences, addiction, and treatment.</description>
