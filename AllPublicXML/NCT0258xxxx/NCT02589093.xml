  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiology daily practice consists in management of sedation, immobility and analgesia.
      The monitoring of this last component remains largely based on indirect signs with poor
      sensitivity and specificity such as heart rate and blood pressure. Accordingly, there is an
      increased demand for more accurate analgesia monitors. Several parameters have been studied
      in the recent years such as spectral entropy, skin conductance, pupillometry or heart rate
      variability (HRV). The HRV is influenced by the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic
      tones, and is therefore influenced by pain and analgesia.

      MDoloris Medical Systems SAS, located in Lille, France, had developed a monitor called
      PhysioDoloris (TM) that uses an analysis of the HRV to generate a clinically useable index,
      the Analgesia-Nociception Index (ANI). The ANI varies from 0 to 100, a lower number
      indicating less parasympathetic tone. It has been shown in previous studies under general
      anesthesia to decrease at the moment of surgical incision and pneumoperitoneum inflation and
      to increase with opioids administration.

      The purpose of this study is to show a correlation between the variation of the ANI with pain
      scores in awake healthy volunteers who are subjected to standardized painful stimuli of
      increasing intensity. The investigators hypothesize that an increasing pain score will
      correlate with decreasing ANI values.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ANI index values during increasing intensities of moderately painful electrical stimulation at the forearm level.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during the entire cycle of stimulation (approx. 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>The ANI is an index that can vary from 0 (maximum pain) to 100 (no pain) in humans. The primary objective of this study will be to record the ANI values all along the time period of the clinical evaluation, while the subjects are submitted to standardized electrical stimulation going from 0 mA (no stimulation) to a maximum of 25 mA (or less according to the subject tolerance).
Each stimulation lasts for 3 minutes. During these 3 minutes the ANI is electronically recorded automatically but the Physiodoloris device. The quantitavive value of the index is then analyzed during each stimulation and for all the stimulations.
This will allow to evaluate whether it exists any correlation between the ANI values and the intensity of the electrical stimulation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ANI correlation with Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during the entire cycle of stimulation (approx. 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>NRS and ANI absolute values will be recorded all along the study duration (approx. 30min). This will allow to evaluate a likely correlation between the ANI absolute values and the NRS values.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed during the entire cycle of stimulation (approx. 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>ANI values and HR are recorded for the whole duration of the study. A correlation between these two criteria will be evaluated to know if HR increases (more pain) when ANI decreases (more pain).</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive progressive electrical stimulations with an external nerve stimulator over the ulnar nerve, from 0 mA to 30 mA in increments of 5 (2 Hz single twitch mode), for 3 minutes at each intensity. They will be asked to score their pain level (NRS 0-10) every minute. ANI will be recorded constantly.</description>
