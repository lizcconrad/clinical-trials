      The enrolled patients will be randomly divided into three groups: group of online self
      management, group of online mutual management and the control group. The estimated sample
      size was 78 patients for each group. All the patients attend two follow-up visits at the
      hospital, after 3 and 6 months. The data will be collected by a full-time recorder and
      analyzed using specific statistical software. The enumeration data are analyzed by chi-square
      test, while the measurement data are analyzed by one-way ANOVA.
