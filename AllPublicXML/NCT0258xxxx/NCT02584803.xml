  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the feasibility of 2 different ultrasound views of the inferior vena
      cava (IVC), a large vein that returns blood to the heart. Ultrasound is safe in pregnancy
      and, is regularly used to evaluate the fetus. It is hoped that imaging of the IVC will then
      allow us to determine the fluid status of the parturient which could be helpful in treating
      hemodynamic instability. This study will not involve any change in management of the
      participating patients.

    <textblock>
      Anesthesiology consultants and trainees with US experience will first perform scans from the
      RUQ view starting on the mid-axillary line at the T4 intercostal space, looking to obtain a
      view of the IVC as it enters the right atrium (RA). Following successful acquisition, the
      examiner will perform scan from the subxiphoid position, looking to obtain the same view of
      the IVC transitioning into the RA. Primary endpoint will be time to obtaining quality of
      images. The investigator will use a stopwatch to time acquisition of images. If the duration
      of scanning exceeds ten minutes, the scan will be discontinued and labeled as failed. Each
      image will be separately reviewed by 2 different US specialists with extensive US experience.
      Images will be assessed according to a Likert scale from 1 to 5. (Very poor (1), poor (2),
      acceptable (3), good (4), very good (5)) Secondary endpoints will be assessed as follows: 1.
      Acceptability: all patients participating in the study will complete a questionnaire to
      assess acceptability. 2. Comfort: During the exam the patient will have the option to suspend
      the scan by stating they are uncomfortable and wish to stop. Each request will be noted and
      taken into the account at data analysis. Furthermore, patients will be given a questionnaire
      at the end of the scan and asked to rate their comfort level during procedure according to
      Likert scale. (Very comfortable (5), comfortable (4), equivocal (3), uncomfortable (2), very
      uncomfortable (1)) 3. Ease of exam: Examiner will rate the ease of image acquirement
      according to Likert scale. (impossible (1), difficult (2), equivocal (3), easy (4), very easy
      (5))
