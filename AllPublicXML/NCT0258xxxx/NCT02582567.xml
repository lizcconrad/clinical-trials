  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of a novel and supervised
      exercise intervention in overweight pregnant and their newborn.

      Methods/Design: The present study is a Randomized Controlled Trial. Sixty overweight pregnant
      interested in participate in the intervention program will be randomly assigned to either
      exercise (3 sessions/week), or to usual care (control) group (30 pregnant per group). The
      primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic
      profile. Secondary outcomes measure are: i) body composition; ii) dietary patterns; iii)
      physical fitness; iv) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; v)
      sleep quality; vi) mental health, quality of life and positive health; vii) haematology and
      biochemical analysis; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone
      health biomarkers; xi) adiposity-related proteins expression. The data will be analysed on an
      intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.

Moreover, 4 genes highly involved in foetal and postnatal development of adipose tissue have been selected; two are receptors: the Glucocorticoid receptor and the PPAR-γ, and two are metabolic enzymes: beta-11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I or 11βHSD1, and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II or 11βHSD2. Of great importance are PPAR-γ1 and PPAR-γ2, which are generated from the same gene by alternative promoter usage and mRNA. We will measure such proteins as well as paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord plasma by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Western Blot techniques.</description>

    <description>The exercise intervention will be performed in two groups so that each group will have 12-13 participants.The groups will train 3 days/week (60min per session) from the 16th week of gestation until delivery. The exercise intervention group will go through different phases of training: a) Learning phase: which will involve the intervention plan, the goals we want to work, and how we will perform it; b) Movement Learning phase: theoretical and practical sessions with the explanation of movements and ergonomic basic patterns; and c) Physical Fitness Training phase: with training sessions aimed at improving fitness and weight loss, and training sessions focused on a correct pelvic mobilization for the delivery.The intensity will be adapted during the exercise program based on the week of gestation and each pregnant heart rate. The sessions will consist of a mixed work, composed of circuits where both muscular and cardiovascular conditioning will be implemented.</description>
