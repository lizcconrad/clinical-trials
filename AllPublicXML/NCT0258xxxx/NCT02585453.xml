    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a highly prevalent ocular disease with an increasing incidence in the
      elderly population. Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this
      disease. However, exact information about the tear film thickness and the corneal residence
      time of topical lubricants is still sparse, therefore no ideal treatment regimen has been
      found.

      Recently a new method for assessment of tear film thickness based on ultra high resolution
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become available. The aim of the present study is to
      assess tear film thickness and corneal residence time of three different formulations of
      topical lubricants, in particular Thealoz Duo® Eye Drops, Hylo® Gel Eye Drops and Systane®
      Gel Eye Drops in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease. In addition, standard
      tests for dry eye syndrome, such as the ocular surface disease index (OSDI©), Schirmer I test
      and determination of tear break up time (BUT) will be performed.
