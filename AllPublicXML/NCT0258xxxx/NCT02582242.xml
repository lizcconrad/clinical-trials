    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Treatment Satisfaction as Assessed by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (Status) (DTSQs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in patient-reported treatment satisfaction (as assessed by the DTSQs) was evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment. The DTSQs is a self-completion questionnaire used to investigate the subject's treatment satisfaction. The DTSQ contained 8 questions, which were scored on a scale from 0 to 6. Out of 8 questions, 6 were related to the overall treatment satisfaction and 2 were related to glycaemic control (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia). Results for the 6 questions relating to overall treatment satisfaction are presented together whereas the 2 questions relating to blood glucose are presented separately. For the overall treatment satisfaction, a higher score (0−36) was related to a better perception of treatment satisfaction. For hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, a lower score (0−6) was related to a better blood glucose control. Missing data was imputed using the LOCF method.</description>

          <title>Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30 (Three Times Daily)</title>
          <description>Subjects received biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30; a mixture of soluble insulin aspart [IAsp] 30% and protaminated IAsp 70%) three times daily (TID); before breakfast, lunch and main evening meal for a duration of 24-week. BIAsp 30 was administered as subcutaneous (s.c.; under the skin) injection according to the locally approved label and as described in the direction for use. The total daily dose of pre-trial basal insulin was transferred to the total daily starting dose of BIAsp 30 by unit-to-unit, which was distributed along meals at the investigator’s discretion. During the 24-week treatment period, the insulin dose was individually titrated on a weekly basis for all subjects in order to achieve the pre-meal self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.4−6.1 mmol/L (80−110 mg/dL). Subjects continued with their stable, pre-trial dose of metformin (a total daily oral dose of &gt;=1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Achieving HbA1c Below 7.0% Without Severe Hypoglycaemic Episodes.</title>
        <description>Percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c &lt;7.0% (yes or no) without severe hypoglycaemic episodes was evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment. Severe hypoglycaemia: Episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during event, but neurological recovery following return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by low PG concentration.</description>

Subjects continued with their stable, pre-trial dose of metformin (a total daily oral dose of &gt;=1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

          <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes Classified According to Novo Nordisk Definition</title>
          <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as the hypoglycaemic episodes, which occurred on or after the first day of trial product administration (in week 0), and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Novo Nordisk (NN) classification of hypoglycaemia:
Severe hypoglycaemia: According to the ADA classification.
Blood glucose (BG) confirmed hypoglycaemia: an episode that is BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemia: an episode that is severe according to the ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

BIAsp 30 was administered as s.c. injection according to the locally approved label and as described in the direction for use. The total daily dose of pre-trial basal insulin was transferred to the total daily starting dose of BIAsp 30 by unit-to-unit, which was distributed along meals at the investigator’s discretion. During the 24-week treatment period, the insulin dose was individually titrated on a weekly basis for all subjects in order to achieve the pre-meal SMPG target of 4.4−6.1 mmol/L (80−110 mg/dL). Subjects continued with their stable, pre-trial dose of metformin (a total daily oral dose of &gt;=1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

During the 24-week treatment period, the insulin dose was individually titrated on a weekly basis for all subjects in order to achieve the pre-meal SMPG target of 4.4−6.1 mmol/L (80−110 mg/dL). Subjects continued with their stable, pre-trial dose of metformin (a total daily oral dose of &gt;=1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

BIAsp 30 was administered as s.c. injection according to the locally approved label and as described in the direction for use. The total daily dose of pre-trial basal insulin was transferred to the total daily starting dose of BIAsp 30 by unit-to-unit, which was distributed along meals at the investigator’s discretion. During the 24-week treatment period, the insulin dose was individually titrated on a weekly basis for all subjects in order to achieve the pre-meal SMPG target of 4.4−6.1 mmol/L (80−110 mg/dL). Subjects continued with their stable, pre-trial dose of metformin (a total daily oral dose of &gt;=1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Treatment Satisfaction as Assessed by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (Status) (DTSQs)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in patient-reported treatment satisfaction (as assessed by the DTSQs) was evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment. The DTSQs is a self-completion questionnaire used to investigate the subject’s treatment satisfaction. The DTSQ contained 8 questions, which were scored on a scale from 0 to 6. Out of 8 questions, 6 were related to the overall treatment satisfaction and 2 were related to glycaemic control (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia). Results for the 6 questions relating to overall treatment satisfaction are presented together whereas the 2 questions relating to blood glucose are presented separately. For the overall treatment satisfaction, a higher score (0−36) was related to a better perception of treatment satisfaction. For hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, a lower score (0−6) was related to a better blood glucose control. Missing data was imputed using the LOCF method.</description>
