      This purpose of this two-part study is to measure how much of the study drug gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. In Part A, each participant
      will receive two treatments, a single dose and a continuous dose of U-500R insulin, both
      administered just under the skin. Participants who complete Part A will continue into Part B
      where they will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatments with U-500R insulin, injected either twice
      or three times daily under the skin for 5-10 days. This study can last from 7-14 weeks
      including initial screening and follow up.
