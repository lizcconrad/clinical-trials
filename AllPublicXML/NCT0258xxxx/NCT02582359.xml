      This research study is evaluating drugs called Millennium 9708 (referred to as MLN9708) in
      combination with standard therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consisting of daunorubicin
      and cytarabine as a possible treatment for the patient AML.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a clinical trial comprised of two Phase I portions an induction
      treatment (initial treatment), and a consolidation treatment (which is given later). The
      patient is being asked to participate in one or both phase I portions of this study.

      A phase I study tests the safety of an investigational drug or combination of drugs. Phase I
      studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is being studied. It also
      means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the drug combination
      for the participant's type of cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the safety and tolerability of MLN9708
      in combination with standard treatment for adults 60 years of age or older with AML.

      In the first phase I portion of treatment (&quot;induction&quot;) participants will receive MLN9708 in
      combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Once the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      MLN9708 is established in this induction portion, up to 36 additional participants will be
      enrolled in the portion focusing on consolidation.

      The drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine have been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration). MLN9708 is not approved by the FDA.

          -  Prior chemotherapy treatment for AML (Prior treatment with hydroxyurea and/or
             leukapheresis to control white blood cell count acceptable). Prior chemotherapy for
             MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) such as azacitidine, decitabine, and
             thalidomide, is permitted, but such treatments once MDS or MPN has transformed to AML
             is not permitted.

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) by WHO criteria [AML with t(15;17)]

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 40%

          -  Systemic treatment, during or within 48 hours of the first dose of MLN9708, with
             strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin), strong inhibitors
             of CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole,
             nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort.
             The washout period will be extended to 2 days if patients are receiving extended
             release ciprofloxacin. For this protocol prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended,
             at least not until 48 hours after the last dose of study drug (given on Day 12), when
             the patient may be neutropenic. For patients with fever and/or infections, cefepime
             and ambisome are acceptable.
