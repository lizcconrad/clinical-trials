      Primary Aims: To determine how effective long term Natalizumab (NTZ) therapy is in slowing
      the progression of whole brain atrophy. Whole brain atrophy rates will be measured through
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and compared between patients with Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS) who have been using NTZ for at least 2 years versus age and gender-matched healthy
      controls. The primary outcome will be whole brain atrophy rate measured as the percent change
      in brain volume (PBVC) over a two-year period.

      Primary hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that long term (&gt;2 years) NTZ therapy will slow the rate of
      whole brain atrophy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (as measured by percent change
      in brain volume), reaching a whole brain atrophy rate similar to that of non-MS controls (a
      true &quot;disease activity free&quot; state).
