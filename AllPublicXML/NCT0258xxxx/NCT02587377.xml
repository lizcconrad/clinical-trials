    <textblock>
      The availability of sensitive and specific fungal biomarkers could be a precious help to
      improve the management of patients suffering from fungal diseases, not only by allowing
      preemptive treatment, but also by offering objective elements to assess patient therapeutic
      response and prognosis.

      The use of such biomarkers could also contribute to accurately evaluate novel antifungal
      drugs effectiveness and to serve as a valuable tool to guide decisions regarding ineffective
      treatments and dose selection in product development. Using two or three tests may increase
      the sensitivity to detect IFI.

      The results of the serum assays will be correlated to the definition of 'proven' fungal
      infection as defined by the EORTC/MSG criteria published in 2008. Based upon results from
      adults' studies, the investigators estimate that galactomannan antigen or 1, 3 Î²-D glucan
      could reasonably have a 90% sensitivity (with a 95% CI between 73% and 98%) under the current
      design. As concern the aspergillus fumigatus PCR, sensitivity and specificity could be
      estimated between 63% to 100% and 87% to 96.7%, respectively.
