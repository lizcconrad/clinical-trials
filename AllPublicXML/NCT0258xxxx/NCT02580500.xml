      Pilonidal dermoid cyst surgery under general anesthesia and regional anesthesia techniques is
      used.regional anesthesia techniques; spinal, epidural, spinal epidural (combined) and is the
      local anesthesia.In the investigators study, pilonidal dermoid cyst surgery in spinal and
      epidural anesthesia techniques activity, reliability will be compared to the side effects and
      complications.

      One hundred patients will be randomly assigned to either the pilonidal dermoid cyst under
      Spinal anaesthesia (50 patients)(Group 1) or pilonidal dermoid cyst under epidural
      anaesthesia (50 patients)(Group 2). Group 1 will be used in spinal catheter in spinal
      anesthesia procedures or Group 2 will be used epidural catheter in epidural anaesthesia
      procedures.All patients has symptomatic pilonidal dermoid cyst.

    <textblock>
      Pilonidal dermoid is a tubular skin defect which can be seen in both female and male patients
      between the ages of 12 to 80. Treatment alternatives includes surgical excision. During the
      surgical treatment local, general, spinal or epidural anesthesia could be applied. However,
      local anesthesia usually is not preferred due to the fact that pilonidal dermoid sinuses
      depth, width could not be determined precisely. General anesthesia also is not preferred due
      to the fact that difficulties arising from patient's positioning and positioning based
      potential lung related problems. In general, spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia is
      preferred for pilonidal dermoid sinus surgeries. In this study, the investigators will
      demonstrate advantages, disadvantages, complications, (sensory and motor block levels), and
      durations of spinal and epidural anesthesia and superiority of each on these subjects.

      Patients who are over 18 and have a America Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical score
      of I and II will be included in the study. Patients who are pregnant, have a known allergic
      reactions to local anesthetic and have contraindications against spinal and epidural
      anesthetic will be excluded from the study.

      In this study the investigators separate the patients into 2 groups. Group1: pilonidal
      dermoid cyst under Spinal anaesthesia (50 patients).Group 1 will be used in spinal catheter
      in spinal anesthesia procedures ; Group2:pilonidal dermoid cyst under epidural anaesthesia
      (50 patient).Group 2 will be used epidural catheter in epidural anaesthesia procedures. All
      patients has symptomatic pilonidal dermoid cyst
