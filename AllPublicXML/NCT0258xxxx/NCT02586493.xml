  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease
      characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The mainstay for treatment
      involves the use of inhaled medications, including short and/or long-acting bronchodilators
      along with inhaled corticosteroids. For inhaled medications, the choice of inhalation device
      is an important consideration because an inadequate technique reduces the effects of
      inhalation. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use inhaler that delivers the drug to
      the lungs effectively, is important. This study will assess the correct use of the ELLIPTA
      inhaler by subjects with COPD and to assess ease of use of the ELLIPTA inhaler, as rated by
      those subjects determined to be using the inhaler correctly. Study will be divided into two
      visits i.e. Screening/Visit 1 (day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 28 +/-2) with a phone call on Day
      8+/-2 days of Visit 1 to assess safety. In this multi-center, single-arm, randomised (to
      receive one of two versions of the ELLIPTA inhaler Ease of Use questionnaires), open-label,
      placebo study, only subjects who are have never used the ELLIPTA inhaler before and have an
      established diagnosis of COPD and receiving COPD therapy and are able to demonstrate correct
      use of the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 will be considered eligible to participate in this
      study. Approximately 252 subjects will be screened with an expectation of 208 subjects
      completing the study while demonstrating correct ELLIPTA inhaler use at visit 2.

    <description>Participants rated how easy it was to use the ELLIPTA inhaler, using a four-point Likert scale (1-very easy, 2-easy, 3-difficult, 4-very difficult). &quot;Easy to use&quot; was defined as the combination of an &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;very easy&quot; rating choice. The percentage was reported overall for the single treatment group along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentage calculated using the exact binomial distribution. The percentage is based off the number of participants analyzed i.e the number of subjects in the MITT population (subjects who received a dose of study medication and were randomised).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With COPD Who Rate the Use of the ELLIPTA Inhaler as Easy or Very Easy, Among Those Who Demonstrate Correct Use of the Inhaler at the End of the Study.</title>
        <description>Participants rated how easy it was to use the ELLIPTA inhaler, using a four-point Likert scale (1-very easy, 2-easy, 3-difficult, 4-very difficult). âEasy to useâ was defined as the combination of an âeasyâ or âvery easyâ rating choice. The percentage was reported overall for the single treatment group along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentage calculated using the exact binomial distribution. The percentage is based off the number of participants analyzed i.e the number of subjects in the MITT population (subjects who received a dose of study medication and were randomised).</description>
