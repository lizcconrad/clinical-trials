  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypertension has been recognized as a major causal factor for atrial fibrillation
      (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. In light of its worldwide increasing
      prevalence and incidence and the accompanied increase in the risk of stroke, thromboembolic
      events and mortality, AF has emerged as a global healthcare problem.

      Early diagnosis of AF, prior to the occurrence of complications is a recognized priority for
      the prevention of strokes. Once diagnosed, anticoagulant therapy is the cornerstone in the
      management of the risk of stroke in AF patients. The 2012 ESC Guidelines recommend the use of
      a risk factor-based approach to stroke risk stratification for AF patients.

      This study aims towards gaining real-world data on the prevalence of non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) among hypertensives in Greece. The rate of ESC guideline-adherent
      antithrombotic therapy on the basis of stroke and bleeding risk assessments, and factors
      influencing treatment decision-making will be assessed as well in patients diagnosed with the
      arrhythmia.

      Finally, potential differences in the NVAF prevalence in adequately and inadequately
      controlled hypertensives will be documented.
