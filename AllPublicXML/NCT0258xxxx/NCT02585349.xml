  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability, affecting about 34,000 to 41,000 individuals in the
      Netherlands of middle and old age every year. Due to the aging of the population, this figure
      will increase considerably over the next decades (Struijs et al., 2005). Twenty-five percent
      of stroke patients die within one month, making stroke a major risk factor for premature
      death in developed countries. According to the World Health Organization, stroke is the third
      leading cause of the burden of disease in middle and high-income countries (World Health
      Organization, 2008). It has a significant negative impact on quality of life of both the
      patients as well as their caregivers and significant others. Surviving stroke patients often
      struggle with its manifold and lifelong lasting consequences, with 35 percent of patients
      being functionally dependent one year after stroke (Wolfe, 2000) and cognitive and emotional
      changes which are found up to two years post-stroke (Rasquin, Lodder, &amp; Verhey, 2005).
      Depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment are very prevalent and significantly contribute
      to the burden of the disease, but their etiologies remain poorly understood.

      The aim of the CASPER study is to gain more insight into the etiologies of post-stroke
      depression (PSD), post-stroke apathy (PSA), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), and
      post-stroke dementia. Therefore, the primary objectives are to identify biomarker-based
      predictors of PSD, PSA, and VCI. A secondary aim is to study effect modulation, especially
      the interaction between cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative changes and inflammation
      in post-stroke dementia.

      CASPER is a prospective clinical cohort study of 250 first-ever ischemic stroke patients with
      serial assessments at baseline (10 to 12 weeks after stroke), six and 12 months after
      baseline. Another wave (36 month after baseline) was later added.

      Buffycoats from EDTA tubes are taken for DNA extraction (ApoE, CLU, PICALM, CR1, ACE, MTHFR).
      One PAXgene tube is collected to ensure long-term stability of RNA. Extraction of RNA and
      subsequent analysis of expression of inflammatory and stroke-related genes at the mRNA level
      will be done.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First-ever or recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke

          -  MMSE score ≥15 (to ensure valid testing)

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language

          -  Preferably participation of an informant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age younger than 40 years (to exclude atypical strokes)

          -  Pre-stroke dementia (assessed by a semi-structured interview with a relative, based on
             clinical diagnosis or IQ-CODE) in the five years prior to stroke

          -  Psychiatric and neurological disease other than the qualifying event known to affect
             cognition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, Parkinson's
             disease, or epilepsy

          -  Current episode of depression at admission (as evidenced by medical records and
             patient or informant interview). In contrast, a lifetime history of depression will
             not be considered as a reason for exclusion as this is considered a potential risk
             factor for PSD

          -  Severe aphasia (as it interferes with understanding and following test instructions)
