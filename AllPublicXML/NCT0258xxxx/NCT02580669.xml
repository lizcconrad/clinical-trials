  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to show pattern differences of vasoreactivity and connectivity
      between Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, by the use
      of methods of advanced brain MRIs and the Diffusion Tensor Imaging , and correlate these
      differences with Clinical disability and cognitive disorder results.

      The goal of this study is to show pattern differences of vasoreactivity and connectivity
      between Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, by the use
      of methods of advanced brain MRIs, and correlate these differences with Clinical disability
      and cognitive disorder results. The modification of the Diffusion Tensor Imaging are well
      known in these two groups, as well as their link with the occurrence of movement and
      cognitive disorder. The study of the vasoreactivity during MRI aims to confront our results
      to the available data sources.
