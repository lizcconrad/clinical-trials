  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at exploring the differential/topographical in-situ expression of
      cytokines in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients who died with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS), using archived histopathology slides and residual paraffin blocks from
      autopsied cases. Previous studies from the investigators and other groups showed that
      inflammatory cytokines are implicated in several neurological affections, particularly
      neurodegenerative conditions. However, in-situ cytokine expression has never been studied so
      far in ALS. The investigators wanted to see if these neuro-mediators are involved in the
      neuromolecular chain/cascade underlying ALS.

      Archived/residual histopathology sections and paraffin blocks entirely from residual autopsy
      material. Archived material involves old cases (autopsied between 2000 and 2005). All
      autopsies were conducted within the legal frame of the then applicable laws. There is no
      reference whatsoever to names or identifications of the deceased patients (anonymous
      samples).
