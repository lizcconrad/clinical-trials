      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser therapy (LLLT) using the
      Erchonia LUNULA device is effective in increasing clear nail in toenails with onychomycosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nail onychomycosis, or fungus infection, is typically caused by a fungus called
      dermatophytes, but may also be caused by yeasts and molds. These microscopic organisms invade
      the skin through tiny invisible cuts or through a small separation between the nail and the
      nail bed. Under conditions of warmth and moisture, the fungi grow and spread. The infection
      begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of the nail, and as it spreads deeper into the
      nail, causes unsightly and potentially painful nail discoloration, thickening and the
      development of crumbling edges. Onychomycosis occurs more commonly in toenails than in
      fingernails because toenails are often confined in a dark, warm, moist environment inside
      shoes where fungi can thrive. Toenail fungus affects approximately 23 million people in the
      US - about 10% of all adults.

      Potential complications of onychomycosis include pain in the nails, permanent damage to the
      nails, development of other serious infections that can spread beyond the feet for
      individuals with a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions,
      such as leukemia and AIDS.

      Nail fungus can be difficult to treat, and repeated infections are common. Currently
      available treatments for onychomycosis include oral antifungal medications, antifungal
      lacquer, and topical medications, surgical nail removal and photodynamic therapy.

      There is no perfect cure for toenail fungus. Even the most effective oral medications are
      successful only about half of the time, and topical medications are successful less than 10%
      of the time. Recently, research has found laser therapy to show promise as a novel
      alternative treatment for toenail onychomycosis. Unlike medication-driven treatments for
      toenail fungus which can have many side effects including serious ones such as liver
      toxicity, laser therapy presents minimal to no risk of side effects. Laser therapy is applied
      to toenail onychomycosis by shining a laser light through the toenail into the tissue below.
      The laser light vaporizes the fungus while leaving the skin and surrounding healthy tissue
      unharmed.

      Low level laser therapy operates under the principle of photochemistry with a photoacceptor
      molecule absorbing the emitted photons and inducing a biological cascade. Like our eukaryotic
      cell, fungi contain the highly complex organelle the mitochondria, which is responsible for
      the manufacturing of the energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Within the inner
      mitochondrial membrane is cytochrome c oxidase, an identified photoacceptor molecule. It is
      believed that laser therapy could perhaps provide a means to photo-destroy the fungi
      responsible for onychomycosis (OM) by inducing the release of highly reactive superoxides.
      Moreover, laser therapy has been shown to promote superoxide dismutase (SOD), a process
      responsible for the destruction of foreign invaders. Extracellular release of low levels of
      mediators associated with SOD can increase the expression of chemokines, cytokines, and
      endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules, amplifying the cascade that elicits the
      inflammatory response. The physiologic function of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and
      hydroxyl free radical is to destroy phagocytosed microbes. By enhancing the natural processes
      of the immune system and impacting the structural integrity of the fungi strain, it is
      believed that laser therapy may provide a means for clinicians to effectively treat OM
      without the onset of any adverse events.

    <description>Individual toenail success criteria was defined as 3 millimeter (mm) or more of clear nail growth at 6 months post-procedure administration as evaluated relative to baseline.

    <measure>Change in Millimeters (mm) of Clear Nail Bed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Millimeter (mm) of clear nail from the base of the toenail was determined from digital photographs of the toenail using a computer program. Change in mm of clear nail bed was calculated as the difference in mm of clear nail bed from baseline measurement to the measurement at 6 months after the end of the procedure administration phase. An increase in mm of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates that the toenail has improved and is positive for study success. A decrease in mm of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates that the toenail has worsened and is negative for study success.</description>
