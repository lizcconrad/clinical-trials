      The purpose of this study is to examine whether increased dairy intake, at the level
      recommended by Canada's Food Guide, combined with healthy eating and exercise, will improve
      body composition and bone turnover over 12 weeks in overweight and obese girls.

      Three groups (25 girls/group) will participate in this study. Participants must be low dairy
      consumers (0-1 svgs/d) and do little to no structured physical activity at study entry. Each
      participant will be assigned to a group; one of two experimental groups or a control group.
      The two intervention groups will differ only in the amount of dairy consumed (4 svgs vs. 0-1
      svg/d). Both will undergo the same exercise program (3x/wk) and will be counseled on healthy
      eating by a trained nutritionist-dietitian every month. The control group will be tested at
      the beginning and end of the study to help account for any growth-related changes during the
      study but will not receive any formal intervention. In each group, the investigators will
      assess body composition (muscle mass, fat mass, % body fat and regional fat mass) and bone
      (bone turnover markers). The investigators will also measure various metabolic and
      inflammatory markers, hormones as well as dietary intake, strength and fitness.

      This study has 2 phases. Phase 1 (12 week intervention) will determine whether increased
      intake of dairy products improve bone and body composition during a 12-week weight management
      intervention. The investigators expect the two groups participating in the intervention to
      show significant changes in body weight and body composition and greater gains in strength
      and fitness compared to the control group. The investigators expect those consuming dairy to
      show greater improvements in body composition and bone health compared to those not consuming
      added dairy. The investigators also anticipate better vitamin D status, less whole-body
      inflammation and a better balance of hormones directly affecting the bones and calcium use in
      those consuming dairy. Both intervention groups should show improvements in fasting insulin,
      glucose and cholesterol. In Phase 2 (acute exercise bout) the investigators will examine
      whether the 12-week weight management intervention, with and without dairy, affected the bone
      turnover response to a single bout of bone stimulating exercise. The same participants will
      perform two sessions of jumping exercises that have previously been shown to stimulate bone
      formation and improve bone strength. One session will be performed at the start of the 12
      week intervention, and the other at the end. The investigators expect the girls who consumed
      dairy for 12 weeks to show a more pronounced bone response, characterized by greater bone
      formation and less resorption for up to 24 h after exercise. The investigators also expect
      those who completed the 12-week diet and exercise program (regardless of dairy intake) to
      show a quicker return to normal of exercise-induced inflammation and to show a further
      benefit to bone compared to the control group.
