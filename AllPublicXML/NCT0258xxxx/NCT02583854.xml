  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transradial route is used in 90% of the coronary angiograms performed at Oslo University
      Hospital (OUS), Ullev√•l. A compression device needs to be applied after the procedure to
      achieve hemostasis. Patients and staff will benefit from using a device that yields safe and
      painless hemostasis.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the standard compression device (control
      group, A) or a recently developed compression device (experimental group, B). The study will
      be designed as a non-inferiority, prospective randomized controlled trial, with outcome
      measures being patient comfort during compression time and complication rates. Complications
      that will be measured are radial artery occlusion (RAO) measured using ultrasound at a follow
      up visit. Hematomas or bleeds from the puncture site after application of the compression
      device will also be classified as complications.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the new device, RY-STOP is non-inferior
      compared to the standard device, when considering the outcome measures.
