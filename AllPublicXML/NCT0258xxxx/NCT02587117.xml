  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common sub-acute, chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous
      disease.This study was evaluated the comparative efficacy of lycopene and prednisolone for
      the treatment of oral lichen planus. Half of participants (total number of participants was
      twenty eight) were received lycopene and the other half were received prednisolone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prednisolone and lycopene were produced remission of lesions in oral lichen planus patients,
      but they do so by different mechanisms.

      The main cause of oral lichen planus is still unknown. Some authors advocate the disease
      appears to be a result of T-cell-mediated autoimmune responses in oral epithelial tissues.
      But, recent study suggests that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid
      peroxidation together with an imbalance in the antioxidant defense system may play a part in
      the generation of disease.

      Lycopene exerts its antioxidant activity by physical and chemical quenching of free radicals
      and decreases free radicals-initiated oxidative reactions, particularly lipid peroxidation
      and DNA oxidative damage, thereby preventing tissue damage.

      Prednisone have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.It suppresses the
      inflammatory response by limiting the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inhibiting
      synthesis of pro-inflammatory products such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and
      platelet activating factors (PAF) by indirectly inhibiting phospholipase A2 and negative
      regulating cyclooxygenase (COX-2).

    <description>Reticular: score 0= no white striations; score 1= white striations. Erythematous: score 0= no lesion; score 1= lesion &lt;1 cm2; score 2: lesion 1-3 cm2; score 3= lesion &gt;3 cm2. Ulceration: score 0= no lesion; score 1= lesion &lt;1 cm2; score 2= lesion 1-3 cm2; score 3= lesion &gt;3 cm2. Total weighted score was derived by sum total scores of each lesion and multiplication with weighted score 1.5 &amp; 2.0 in total erythematous and total ulceration scores as ΣR + ΣE × 1.5 + ΣU × 2.0.Total weighted score was dependent on the number of lesions of each participant which was not the same across participants. Higher value of the total score represent worse outcome &amp; zero value represent no lesion.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Only symptomatic oral lichen planus patients, who were fulfill inclusion and exclusion criteria, were selected and recruited from the outpatient department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, College of dental surgery, BPKIHS on the basis of randomization list. The first patients was recruited on 21/02/2013 and the last patients was on 28/01/2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Before enrollment, full explanation about the study was given and written informed consent was taken. A detailed clinical history, clinical examination,baseline investigations and punch biopsy were taken. Patient was on treatment with medication for the same lesions asked to stop the treatment and a washout period of 3 weeks was given.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Change in Severity of Lesions(Degree of Reticular, Erythematous and Ulceration) by Using Piboonniyom REU Severity Score</title>
          <description>Reticular: score 0= no white striations; score 1= white striations. Erythematous: score 0= no lesion; score 1= lesion &lt;1 cm2; score 2: lesion 1-3 cm2; score 3= lesion &gt;3 cm2. Ulceration: score 0= no lesion; score 1= lesion &lt;1 cm2; score 2= lesion 1-3 cm2; score 3= lesion &gt;3 cm2. Total weighted score was derived by sum total scores of each lesion and multiplication with weighted score 1.5 &amp; 2.0 in total erythematous and total ulceration scores as ΣR + ΣE × 1.5 + ΣU × 2.0.Total weighted score was dependent on the number of lesions of each participant which was not the same across participants. Higher value of the total score represent worse outcome &amp; zero value represent no lesion.</description>
