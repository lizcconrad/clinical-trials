  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium in older patients is associated with increased mortality and health care costs. And
      delirium is frequent in intensive care unit (ICU). Circadian rhythm alteration is one of the
      most important risk factor for developing delirium. In this study, investigators will
      investigate the effect of administration of melatonin on postoperative delirium in elderly
      ICU patients.

      Randomly selected patients of the melatonin group are given 5mg of melatonin in the evening
      from the day before surgery to the the 5th postoperation day. In contrast, patients in the
      control group are given placebo.

      Primary outcome of this study is the incidence of postoperative delirium measured by ICD-SC
      (Intensive Care delirium Screening Checklist). And secondary outcome includes
      intra-procedural hemodynamics measured by amount of used vasopressors, heart rate and blood
      pressure, total amount of sedatives, total amount of analgesics, duration of mechanical
      ventilation, duration of ICU stay.

      Thus, investigators perform this study to investigate the relationship between delirium and
      circadian rhythm.
