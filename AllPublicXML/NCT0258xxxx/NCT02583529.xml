      Dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract are non-motor symptoms common engines in Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Urodynamic changes in PD include overactive bladder (OB), characterized by
      urgency with or without urge incontinence , usually with frequency and nocturia . The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the treatment of OB in patients
      with PD with the use of a specific treatment: Posterior Tibial Nerve Electrostimulation
      (PTNE).

      Introduction: Dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract are non-motor symptoms common engines
      in Parkinson's disease (PD). Urodynamic changes in PD include overactive bladder (OB),
      characterized by urgency with or without urge incontinence , usually with frequency and
      nocturia . The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the
      treatment of OB in patients with PD with the use of a specific treatment: Posterior Tibial
      Nerve Electrostimulation (PTNE). Materials and methods: This is test-clinical, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled comparison with placebo. The research will be conducted with patients
      diagnosed with PD and symptoms of OB in the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, in the
      Movement Disorders and Urogynecology Ambulatories. The patients are divided into two groups,
      one of which receives placebo stimulation (often below the therapeutic threshold). They will
      be assessed before and after 12 weeks of treatment with home PTNE through specific form of
      questionnaires assessing incontinence, quality of life and voiding diary. After the end of
      treatment will be made up of patients to verify the effectiveness of treatment in 30 to 90
      days. Hypothesis: Through this research the investigators hope to determine the true efficacy
      of this treatment method with PTNE in OB in PD with a high level of evidence, seeking to
      improve urinary symptoms and quality of life in this patient population.

    <measure>Voiding diary</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of daily annotation fluid intake, frequency (number) and volume of urination (mL), daily activities and episodes of incontinence (number), need and number of hygienic protections, etc. It is a cost-effective method of initially assessing urinary complaints when compared to the test pad (pad test) and standardized symptom scales.The voiding diary will be filled before and after treatment that will last 03 months (baseline and 3 months). The patient will record your urinary habits for one day (24 hours) before starting treatment and after completion.</description>

    <measure>Hoehn and Yahr Disability Stage of scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Developed in 1967, called the DP indication of the general state of the patient. It comprises five phases (Table 1). On this scale, patients classified in stages 1, 2 and 3 show mild to moderate disability, while in stages 4 and 5 show more severe disability. HY is applied before treatment (baseline).</description>

    <measure>King's Health Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The questionnaire presents 32 items distributed into 10 domains and is available in 26 languages. A change from baseline of 5 points (out of 100) in any field indicates significant clinical improvement. KHQ is applied before and after treatment (baseline and 3 months).</description>
