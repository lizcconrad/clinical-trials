  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study aims to evaluate the effects of autologous bone marrow aspirate
      concentrate (BMAC) on the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in patients
      undergoing meniscectomy. This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial will
      compare patient-reported outcomes, specifically IKDC scores between patients who receive BMAC
      post-meniscectomy and those who receive a saline control injection. The study will also
      compare physical examination, MRI, radiographs, and synovial fluid analysis. Our hypothesis
      is that those who receive the autologous BMAC injection after the procedure will have better
      outcomes than those who do not.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated both the safety of BMAC intra-articular injection and
      improvements in subjective, patient reported outcomes in patients with existing knee OA.
      Unfortunately these studies were largely uncontrolled, underpowered, and/or retrospective in
      nature. Additionally, a recent prospective, randomized clinical study of allograft
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected at a separate time point post surgical intervention
      has highlighted the ability of MSCs to increase meniscal volume and improve knee pain
      following injection.

      This will be the first study to examine the effects of autograft BMAC intra-articular
      injection in a single-stage procedure and in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion.
      The results of this study, if the null hypothesis is rejected, will have far-reaching
      implications for the standard of care in meniscal treatment and on OA progression in the
      knee. Additionally, if the results of this study are favorable in reduction of OA progression
      this study will change the surgical approach to all axial, synovial joints including the
      shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle.

    <description>Subjects will undergo the scheduled meniscectomy procedure. Following the procedure the investigator will make a small incision and create the marrow access channel in the proximal tibia. The experimental group will then have bone marrow harvested and BMAC will be prepared using a BMAC harvesting system. The automated centrifuge system rapidly concentrates cellular contents and growth factors in bone marrow aspirate using flow cytometry. The BMAC will be injected intra-articularly.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo the same meniscectomy procedure and will also have an incision and marrow access channel made in the proximal tibia, however no bone marrow will be harvested. The control group will have a placebo injection of saline into the affected knee.</description>
