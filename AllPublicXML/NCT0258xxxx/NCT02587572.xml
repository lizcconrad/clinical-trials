      This is a phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs) in subjects with metabolic
      syndrome and to assess the effects of LMSCs on endothelial function using several different
      doses.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs) in subjects with metabolic syndrome and
      to assess the effects of LMSCs on endothelial function using several different doses.
      Following a successful run-in phase, a total of forty (40) subjects will be randomized
      (1:1:1:1) to receive one of three different doses of LMSCs or placebo. After randomization,
      baseline imaging, testing and study product infusion, subjects will be followed up at 24
      hours, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12 post study product infusion. All
      endpoints will be assessed at the 3, 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 90±30 days,
      180±30 days, and 365±30 days respectively from the day of the study product infusion (Day 1).
      For the purposes of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, an &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; study
      population will be utilized.
