      Effective communication between consulting physicians and the emergency physicians is
      critical for patients in the emergency department. Many hospitals still use outdated pager
      systems as the foundation for clinical communication between physicians and other health care
      professionals. But, outdated pager systems contain some problems including long waiting-times
      for the return of a page, high costs, frequent interruptions, and the inability to identify
      the location or identity of the caller. This outdated communication technologies in
      healthcare can place patient safety at risk. Therefore they are no longer seen as an
      effective communication tool given the obvious advantages of Smart phones. WhatsApp
      Messenger, which is a messaging program for smart phones, is the most commonly used for
      communication in at present. As of September 2015, WhatsApp incorporated announced more than
      900 million users. This is making it the most globally popular messaging application.
      WhatsApp Messenger have been started to be used for communication in healthcare. So, this
      study aims to trial the effect of whatsApp usage for communication between physicians.

      Study Design and Setting: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, single-center,
      clinical trial was conducted in ED of a tertiary care university hospital with an annual
      census of approximately 200,000 visits.
