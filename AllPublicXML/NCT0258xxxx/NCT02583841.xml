      Aim:

      To evaluate effect of non- surgical periodontal therapy on liver function in systemically
      healthy chronic periodontitis (CP) subjects.

      Materials and methods:

      The study is non surgical interventional trial, includes 50 CP subjects in the age group of
      35- 60 years selected from the OPD (Out Patient Department) of department of periodontology
      Tatyasaheb Kore Dental College and Research center (TKDC and RC), Kolhapur. CP subjects were
      equally divided into test group and control group. Liver function test- aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were checked at baseline and at 1
      month after treatment. Clinical examination includes plaque index, gingival index, sulcus
      bleeding index, probing depth, clinical attachment loss.
