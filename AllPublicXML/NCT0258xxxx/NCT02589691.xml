  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of the occurrence of respiratory events is a constant concern in pediatric
      anesthesia, as these represent the main cause of the anesthesic mortality. These events occur
      partly during induction of anesthesia and are all the more frequent as the child is young.

      The French recommendations do not propose the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents in
      pediatric anesthesia. This recommendation is controversial In a recently published study, it
      has been shown that the use of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction in children
      under 2 years improves intubating conditions and reduces the incidence of hemodynamic and
      respiratory events. This monocentric study, centered on intubating conditions, does not allow
      to conclude on the influence of muscle relaxants on reduction of the respiratory morbidity.

      The objective of study is to demonstrate that, in children under 2 years, changing the
      anesthesia protocol can reduce the incidence and severity of episodes of hypoxemia associated
      with respiratory events occurring during induction
