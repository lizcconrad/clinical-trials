    <textblock>
      Topical antihypertensive eye drops are a key element of modern antiglaucoma treatment. Most
      of these eye drops contain preservatives to allow for the use of multi-dose containers. In
      the recent years evidence has, however, accumulated that these preservatives may induce
      ocular surface disease (OSD). This is particularly true for the most widely used
      preservative, benzalkonium chloride (BAK). Whereas this is well documented in many in vitro
      and animal studies, evidence from clinical trials is sparse. The only randomized masked study
      that showed superiority is a pivotal company-sponsored study indicating improved tolerability
      and reduced hyperemia of unpreserved versus preserved latanoprost eye drops.

      The investigators have recently introduced an optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology
      that provides a resolution as high as 1.2 µm for the human cornea. Using this technology the
      investigators were able to show that tear film thickness (TFT) is negatively correlated with
      symptoms of OSD. Changes in TFT can be assessed with very high sensitivity below the level of
      resolution as also evident from studies after administration of lubricants.

      In the present study, the investigators hypothesize that switching glaucoma patients from
      preserved prostaglandin analogues to unpreserved latanoprost is associated with an increase
      in TFT as measured with OCT. As a control the investigators will use preserved latanoprost
      and the study hypothesis will be tested in a randomized, controlled, single-masked parallel
      group design. TFT is chosen as main outcome variable, standard measures for signs and
      symptoms of OSD are selected as secondary outcomes. The present study may provide valuable
      information on the superiority of unpreserved versus preserved therapy.
