      This study aims to assess differences in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) distribution in the
      brain between seasonal affective disorder patients and healthy controls using positron
      emission tomography. In addition the investigators aim to demonstrate the impact of light
      therapy on MAO-A distribution

      In addition, a pilot study and a sub-study in healthy controls were performed

      This study aims to assess differences in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) distribution in the
      brain between seasonal affective disorder patients and healthy controls using positron
      emission tomography. In addition, the investigators aim to demonstrate the impact of light
      therapy on MAO-A distribution by investigating patients and controls in the winter before
      bright light therapy, in the winter after bright-light therapy, and in the summer. Bright
      light therapy will be placebo controlled, randomized, and double blinded.

    <description>One subgroup of SAD patients and healthy controls respectively will receive bright light therapy using an artificial white light source (PhysioLight LD220 by DAVITA®, www.davita.de/shop/lichttherapiegeraete/lichtduschen-tageslicht/physiolight-ld-220.html) with full-spectrum 10.000lux light intensity. The treatment will be applied 30min per day at a distance of about of 50cm, preferably in the morning, during 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>The second subgroup of the SAD patients and healthy controls will receive a non-biologically active light source (&lt;400nm or &gt;500nm). Here, the lamp will have largely similar shape and size as compared to the therapeutic device, but the fluorescent tube with the high light intensity will be replaced by an ordinary bulb.</description>
