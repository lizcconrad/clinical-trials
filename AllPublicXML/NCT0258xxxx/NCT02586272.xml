    <measure>Percentage of successful implantations</measure>

    <description>The percentage of successful implantation 6 weeks after oocyte retrieval (±3 days), i.e. at approximately 8 weeks gestational age (±3 days) or 8 weeks of amenorrhea (± 3 days), in each group (Control and Interventional groups), overall and within each morphological embryo category, when elective Single Embryo Transfer (SET) is performed on Day 2 or 3.
Successful implantation is defined as the presence in the uterus of at least one gestational sac with fetal heart activity identified on ultrasound.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Women at least 18 years old at the time of informed consent.

          -  2. Able to understand and voluntarily sign an Informed Consent form approved by the
             relevant Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) governing the site.

          -  3. First or second fresh Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) cycle attempt (since
             last successful implantation, if any).

          -  4. Eligible for elective SET of fresh embryo on Day 2/3. Elective SET is defined as a
             transfer for which there is more than one embryo in the same morphological (&quot;best&quot;)
             category as that of the selected embryo.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Presence or history of ovarian endometriotic cyst.

          -  2. Presence or history of diagnosed severe endometriosis (i.e. stage IV the revised
             American Fertility Society classification for endometriosis).

          -  3. Hormonal, functional, anatomical and/or any other abnormalities potentially
             increasing the risk of miscarriage and/or ectopic pregnancy as judged by the
             Investigator and determined by medical history and clinical laboratory. This includes,
             but is not limited to, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disease,
             alcoholism, drug abuse, abnormal uterine cavity etc.

          -  4. History of two or more consecutive miscarriages.

          -  5. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis C virus and/or Hepatitis B
             virus infection.

          -  6. The subject has other serious or acute conditions that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would preclude her participation in the study.

          -  7. Need for preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening.

          -  8. Use of time-lapse embryo imaging.

          -  9. Participating in oocyte donation procedure.

          -  10. Participation in any interventional drug clinical investigation within 2 months
             prior to screening.

          -  11. Dependency on sponsor or investigator (e.g. co-worker or family member).
