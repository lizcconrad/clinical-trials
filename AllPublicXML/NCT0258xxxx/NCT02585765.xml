  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PU) are skin breakdowns that often form after blood flow in the skin is
      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention, PUs still
      represent a major health risk for persons with SCI. Among the numerous potential physical
      risk factors identified for the development of a PU were several conditions that have a
      significant negative effect on skin blood flow. In addition, improper management of blood
      sugar is a major risk factor for PU development and it impedes healing. It would appear that
      hormones (i.e., chemical signals in the blood) associated with how the body uses sugar that
      target the blood vessels may play an important role in the development and formation of a PU.
      In persons with SCI, skin blood flow responses to insulin (i.e., a hormone that helps the
      body use sugar and also relaxes the blood vessels allowing blood flow to increase) in the
      lower extremity were shown to be much lower than healthy individuals.

      The proposed study in up to 30 individuals with chronic SCI and a difficult-to-heal pelvic
      region PU has 2 phases: (1) a 4-week &quot;observation&quot; phase [if the PU does not heal
      appropriately (determined by digital photos and software computation), and the subject is
      found to be insulin resistant then they will progress to the next phase of the study] and (2)
      an 8-week &quot;treatment&quot; phase. All participants will continue to receive the standard wound
      care throughout the observation and treatment phases. If the surface area of the PU does not
      decrease by more than 30% during the 4-week observation phase, the participant will be
      eligible to enter the 8-week treatment phase, in which they will be randomly assigned to
      receive active drug (e.g., pioglitazone) or placebo. The participants will have four study
      visits in which the following will be acquired: digital image of the wound to monitor wound
      surface area, skin blood flow measurements of the peri-wound area, and blood tests to monitor
      liver function, kidney function, blood sugar (hemoglobin A1C, insulin, glucose), nutritional
      status (albumin and pre-albumin), a complete blood count with differential, and makers of
      inflammation. Weekly monitoring of symptoms and participant experiences will be closely
      monitored.

      Pressure ulcers (PU) are skin breakdowns that often form after blood flow in the skin is
      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention strategies, PUs
      still represent a major risk for morbidity in persons with SCI. Among the numerous potential
      physical risk factors identified for the development of a PU were several conditions that
      have a significant adverse influences on skin blood flow. In addition, poor glycemic control
      is a major risk factor for PU development and it impedes healing. Thus, it would appear that
      vasoactive hormones associated with carbohydrate metabolism that target the endothelium may
      play an important role in the development and formation of a PU. In persons with SCI, skin
      blood flow responses to insulin in the lower extremity were shown to be much lower than
      healthy individuals despite no clinical signs of insulin resistance. In the skin next to a
      PU, the current proposal will determine if a once-daily treatment with pioglitazone for 8
      weeks improves skin blood flow after insulin by iontophoresis.
