      Background: People with psychosis show profound deficits in memory. A new cognitive
      remediation therapy using an app on a computer or mobile phone to improve memory has been
      effective in this population, but the neurobiological effects are unknown.

      Objectives: 1) To use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain changes
      during a working memory task before and after a 12 hour memory training intervention on a
      computer or mobile phone, 2) To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine white matter
      connecting prefrontal and parietal lobe before and after training.

      Methods: 46 people with psychosis will be randomized to a computerized training of either
      memory training or a control condition of non-memory games (language/card games) and will
      self-administer 4 hours of training over 4 days per week, for 3 weeks (12 hours total).
      Memory training will be done with the Peak app http://www.peak.net. Imaging data will be
      gathered with a 3 Tesla scanner pre and post training.
