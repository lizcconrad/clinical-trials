  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with PLX3397 and Sirolimus will be
      tolerated and result in shrinking of the cancer or stopping the cancer from growing. In the
      phase I portion, the maximum tolerate dose of the study drug will be determined. In the Phase
      II portion, progression free survival will be assessed at the dose level found in Phase I.
      Participants will continue to take the study drug until they experience an unacceptable side
      effect or their disease progresses. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent up to 10% of adult soft tissue
      sarcomas. Due to its rarity, few MPNST-specific prospective trials exist, and treatments are
      largely based on extrapolation from results from other sarcoma subtypes. Since the molecular
      pathways driving pathogenesis within sarcoma subtypes are distinct, these treatment options
      are likely suboptimal at best. Targeted therapies that block key pathways known to drive
      MPNST will likely result in superior tumor responses with limited toxicities.

    <description>Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone that binds to tacrolimus (FK506) binding protein 12 and inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Sirolimus is currently approved as an immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation and more recently, as a component of cardiac arterial stents because of its potent antiproliferative effects on fibroblasts responsible for restenosis after such a procedure (26) Sirolimus is commonly administered orally on a daily basis, in doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/day.</description>

                  x ULN, albumin ≥ 3.0g/dL.

               -  Bilirubin ≤ ULN; patients with hyperbilirubinemia clinically consistent with an
                  inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism (e.g., Gilbert syndrome) will be
                  eligible at the discretion of the principal investigator.

                  treatment.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and must agree to use an effective form of contraception from the time of
             the negative pregnancy test and for a minimum of 3 months after the last dose of study
             drug. Effective forms of contraception include abstinence, hormonal contraceptive
             (injectable or implantable) in conjunction with a barrier method, or a double barrier
             method. Women of non-child-bearing potential must have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1
             year or surgically sterile. The effects of PLX3397 and sirolimus on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after
             completion of PLX3397 and sirolimus administration.

          -  Fertile men must agree to use an effective method of birth control during the study
             and for up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study-related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.

          -  Agree to pre and post-treatment tumor biopsies.

          -  Prior treatment-related Adverse Events must be ≤ grade 1 (CTCAE v4.0), except
             alopecia, at time of initiating study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier or
             within 14 days from cycle 1 day 1 of PLX3397 and sirolimus.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents concurrently.

          -  Concomitant treatment with other anti-neoplastic agents (hormonal therapy acceptable).

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases. Subjects with untreated brain metastasis ≤
             1 cm can be considered eligible if deemed asymptomatic by the investigator upon
             consultation with the medical monitor and do not require immediate radiation or
             steroids. Subjects with brain metastasis that is treated and stable for 1 month may be
             considered eligible if they are asymptomatic and on stable dose of steroids or if they
             do not require steroids following successful local therapy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PLX3397 or sirolimus.

          -  For Phase 2 - Prior exposure to a receptor tyrosine kinase or mammalian target of
             Rapamycin inhibitor.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PLX3397 and sirolimus are agents
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with PLX3397 and sirolimus, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with PLX3397 and sirolimus.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, active liver disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Active secondary malignancy unless the malignancy is not expected to interfere with
             the evaluation of safety and is approved by the Sponsor. Examples of the latter
             include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix,
             and isolated elevation of prostate-specific antigen. Subjects with a completely
             treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years are eligible.

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating
             study drug or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.

          -  Previous radiotherapy to 25% or more of the bone marrow and/or radiation therapy
             within 28 days prior to study entry.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules, or refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, an
             external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate
             absorption.

          -  Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York (NY) Heart Association class III or IV;
             unstable coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction (MI) more than 6 months prior
             to study entry is permitted); or serious cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Baseline QTc corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥ 450 ms (males) or ≥ 470 ms
             (females)

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PLX3397. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow
             suppressive therapy. Similarly, patients with chronic or acute hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are also ineligible.

          -  Of the five major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, 3A4 (BFC) may be involved in Phase I
             metabolism of PLX3397, with possibly CYP1A2 playing a minor role. Until information
             regarding exposure toxicity and exposure-response relationships are available with
             PLX3397, concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are not permitted in the
             event they alter the systemic exposure to PLX3397 (see Attachment 1 for a list of
             common CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers). These include anticonvulsants, mycin
             antimicrobials, and antiretrovirals. Some common examples include inhibitors such as
             erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, and inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine,
             phenytoin, efavirenz, and nevirapine. Concomitant treatment is permitted if the
             medication is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of
             the study drug. Sirolimus undergoes extensive hepatic and intestinal metabolism via
             CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, as well as excretion by P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A inhibitors
             such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice are not permitted. Patients should be
             monitored for supratherapeutic toxic levels of sirolimus and PLX3397. As bone marrow
             suppression including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in
             patients receiving sirolimus monotherapy, these adverse effects may be exacerbated in
             combination with PLX3397 for which patients will be closely monitored.
