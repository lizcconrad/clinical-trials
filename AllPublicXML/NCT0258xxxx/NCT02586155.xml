    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bromodomain extraterminal domain (BET)
      inhibition treatment with RVX000222 in high-risk type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with
      coronary artery disease increases the time to major adverse cardiovascular events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority (75%) of deaths in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM) are due to
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies suggest a major adverse
      cardiovascular event (MACE) rate of &gt;11% over 18 months in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      despite a baseline LDL-C of &lt;2.1 mmol/L. Bromodomains (BRDs) are a family of evolutionary
      conserved protein-interaction modules that play key functions in chromatin organization and
      regulation of gene transcription. One recognized family of bromodomain-containing proteins is
      the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family. BET inhibition represents a novel,
      epigenetic approach to treat CAD.

      RVX000222 affects biological processes important in atherosclerosis and acute coronary events
      via selective inhibition of BET proteins. RVX000222 is available as a capsule formulation
      with standard excipients and established stability.

      The BETonMACE study will focus on prevention of subsequent MACE in subjects with CAD and DM
      with high intensity statin therapy as co-medication.
