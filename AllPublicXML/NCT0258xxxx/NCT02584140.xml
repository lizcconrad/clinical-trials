  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a program that uses drug level monitoring, text
      messaging (&quot;iTAB&quot;) and personalized counseling with HIV prevention services, including PrEP
      (medicine that can help prevent HIV infection when taken daily).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-arm longitudinal clinical trial to estimate medication adherence
      and retention in a PrEP HIV prevention program that implements a combination intervention
      strategy that uses text-messages (iTAB) and a staged adherence counseling support strategy
      titrated from real-time drug levels in women at-risk for HIV acquisition.

      A total of 135 participants will receive the combined intervention of text messaging
      adherence reminders and adherence support. The text messaging system consists of daily,
      personalized, automated 2-way text messages to maintain adherence and retention. Participants
      that have a low intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration will receive
      escalated, targeted adherence support. All participants will receive access to PrEP in
      accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of prescribing and clinical assessments
      that include safety monitoring as well as regular HIV and sexually transmitted infection
      (STI) screening. All participants will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment and will
      receive a post study follow-up at 60 weeks. The primary endpoint will be measured at 48
      weeks.
