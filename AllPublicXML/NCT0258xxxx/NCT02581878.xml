  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a recommended dose of BAY1862864 Injection and to investigate how the study drug
      acts in the body, on the cancer cells and how safe it is in patients with advanced
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into two parts: a &quot;dose-escalation part&quot; to evaluate safety profile
      and to explore the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and an &quot;expansion part&quot; to evaluate further
      the safety and tumor response profile of BAY1862864 Injection at the selected dose.
