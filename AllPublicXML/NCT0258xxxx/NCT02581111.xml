  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain-dead patients who provide authorization for organ donation will be randomized to
      naloxone or placebo if baseline arterial blood gas (ABG, after initiation of OPO management)
      reveals hypoxemia (PF ratio &lt; 300), unless they have already been ruled-out for lung
      recovery. Investigators aim to assess whether naloxone improves oxygenation prior to organ
      recovery more than placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naloxone has been used by many OPOs for decades to improve the pulmonary status of brain-dead
      organ donors (based on anecdotal evidence and small uncontrolled studies). Its efficacy in
      this population has never been assessed in a controlled clinical trial. The rationale for its
      use appears to be that it blocks the increase in capillary permeability that occurs with
      herniation and brain death (as demonstrated in a single sheep study of herniation).
      Investigators aim to rigorously test this hypothesis in a randomized placebo-controlled trial
      in brain-dead organ donors who have baseline hypoxemia. The primary outcome will be the acute
      change in oxygenation (on first follow-up ABG after naloxone as well as the final ABG prior
      to organ recovery). Investigators will also assess whether treatment results in more lungs
      being recovered and transplanted, after correcting for baseline variables such as age, blood
      group, smoking history, and cause of death. This study will be performed under the auspices
      of the Organ Donation Research Consortium and be carried out by multiple OPOs across the
      country. Naloxone or blinded placebo (identical syringe filled with saline) will be given
      after the baseline ABG shows hypoxemia (P/F ratio - the PaO2 divided by FiO2, on PEEP of 5
      and usually 100% FiO2). Naloxone and placebo will both be co-administered with a
      neuromuscular blocking agent (e.g. vecuronium, per center protocol) to obviate any increase
      in spinal reflex movements that may be potentiated by naloxone treatment. All other protocols
      for organ donor management should be maintained at each OPO and no other study interventions
      are required. Transplant centers will be informed (through DonorNet) that the organ donor
      being considered for lung recovery has been enrolled in this blinded clinical trial.
