    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine retrospectively if the application of rivaroxaban
      after endovenous laser ablation with and without miniphlebectomy is safe and if it lowers the
      risk of venous thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor, that is used for thrombosis
      prophylaxis for example in the setting of orthopaedic surgery.

      In the observed situation Rivaroxaban was applied in a dosage of 10mg daily during 5 days
      after endovenous laser ablation.
