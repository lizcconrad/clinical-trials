  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving 12 Week sustained virologic response (SVR12)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 is defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than 50 IU/mL 12 weeks (i.e. at least 70 days) after the last actual dose of the ABBVIE REGIMEN.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with virological response at end of treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment 12 or 24 week treatment regimen</time_frame>
    <description>Virological response is defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels less then 50 IU/mL at EoT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who experienced breakthrough.</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study for approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Breakthrough is defined as at least one documented hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels less than 50 IU/mL followed by HCV RNA greater than or equal to 50 IU/mL during treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with relapse at end of treatment (EoT)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment 12 or 24 week treatment regimen</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse is defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels less than 50 IU/mL at EoT followed by HCV RNA greater than or equal to 50 IU/mL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients meeting any of the non-response categories of 12 Week sustained virologic response (SVR12)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The SVR12 non-response categories are on-treatment virologic failure, failure to suppress, relapse, premature study drug discontinuation with no on-treatment virologic failure, missing SVR12 data, and/or none of the above criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment-naïve or -experienced participants with confirmed CHC, genotype 1, receiving

             standard of care and in line with the current local label

          -  If RBV is co-administered with the ABBVIE REGIMEN, it has been prescribed in line with
             the current local label

          -  Participants must not be participating or intending to participate in a concurrent
             interventional therapeutic trial
