      administered in combination with trametinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, non randomized, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with trametinib.

      This study will be conducted in 2 phases:

      Phase 1: This will be the dose escalation phase of the study. Phase 1 will determine the MAD
      or MTD and RP2D of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib, and evaluate its safety and
      tolerability and PK profile in EGFRm NSCLC patients who have failed at least one prior EGFR
      TKI.

      Phase 2: This will be the dose expansion phase. Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary
      efficacy and pharmacodynamics of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib at the RP2D in
      two subsets of EGFRm NSCLC patients.
