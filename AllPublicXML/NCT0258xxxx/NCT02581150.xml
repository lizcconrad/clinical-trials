  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency of outpatient surgery compared to
      conventional hospitalization in endovascular treatment of occlusive arterial disease. A
      cost-utility analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective. Patients referred for
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will be randomized in two arms and a 3 months follow-up
      will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale for ambulatory hospitalization is based on increased demand of hospital care,
      hospital budgets constraints and patients who ask for a prompt recovery. Consequently,
      physicians should find ways to optimize the resources' allocation, without compromising
      quality, safety and efficiency of patient care. Several studies and routine practice have
      shown that ambulatory hospitalization was safe but we are still lacking evidence to
      demonstrate the cost-utility of this kind of management.

    <measure>Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) comparing cost and utility in the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of the study is to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing outpatient surgery to conventional hospitalization in endovascular treatment of occlusive arterial disease. The analysis will be conducted from a society's perspective using a one-month time horizon following the date of intervention (and 2 months before intervention). A microcosting approach will be used to estimate the cost of the surgical intervention in both arms and all subsequent in-hospital and ambulatory care resources consumption will be systematically recorded during the one month follow-up period. Effectiveness will be assessed in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) estimated from patients' answers to the Euroqol EQ-5D questionnaire and french preferences scores. Results will be presented as an incremental cost-per-QALY ratio.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Budget impact analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The budget impact analysis will estimate the net financial profit (the difference between the costs incurred and profits obtained, or avoided costs) in developing the ambulatory surgery in the management of PAD. The perspective adopted will be that of the health care facilities and of the National health insurance. This analysis will be conducted in a 5 years time horizon to consider a full exploitation of the potential for substitution between conventional hospitalisation and ambulatory hospitalisation for eligible patients.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the Treatment of Occlusive Arterial Disease, during an ambulatory hospitalisation, with the use of an arterial closure device (ACD).
The patients treated for PAD (Peripheral Arterial Disease) are informed and prepared in the morning of D0. The surgical endovascular procedure is performed at D0 before 1:00 p.m. The patients leave the hospital in the evening at D0 after a systematic visit.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the Treatment of Occlusive Arterial Disease, during a conventional hospitalisation, with or without ACD (ACD will be used at the discretion of the interventionalist).
The patients treated for PAD arrive at the hospital the day before surgery (D-1). The surgical endovascular procedure takes place the next day (D0). The day after (D1), the patients leave the hospital after a systematic visit.</description>
