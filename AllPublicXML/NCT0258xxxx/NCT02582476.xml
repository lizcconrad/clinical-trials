  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial with a
      cross-over design to investigate the efficacy of bumetanide in patients with hypokalemic
      periodic paralysis (HypoPP).

      The aim is to assess the efficacy of bumetanide in reducing severity and duration of a focal
      attack of weakness in a hand muscle.

      Twelve participants will be recruited.

      Interested patients who provisionally meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will attend NHNN for
      a screening visit to check study eligibility and to have any questions relating to study
      participation answered. Each patient will undertake two assessment visits at approximately
      four weeks apart. Study participants will withhold carbonic anhydrase inhibitor medications
      for 72 hours prior to assessment visits as is standard for McManis testing and restart their
      routine treatment immediately after each visit. Participants will be admitted as an NHNN day
      case. Following baseline assessments a localised attack of weakness will be induced by
      isometric exercise of the abductor digit minimi (ADM) in the hand as per McManis protocol
      below. Participants will be randomly assigned to either bumetanide or placebo for the first
      visit. Identical appearing capsules will be prepared to blind both researcher and participant
      to treatment allocation. The assigned treatment will be taken by mouth at the onset of a
      focal attack defined as 40% decrement in ADM CMAP amplitude compared to the maximum CMAP
      amplitude recorded during or after the exercise. During the admission each patient will be
      monitored according to the research protocol. At the end of the assessment protocol the
      participant will be discharged home. The duration of each admission will be approximately 6
      hours The second assessment will follow an identical protocol to the first, but with the
      other treatment administered.

    <measure>Safety of Bumetanide assessed by vital signs, physical exam, potassium levels and self-reported adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety of Bumetanide in HypoPP within 7 days of each study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline instantaneous potassium measurements as well as laboratory measurements, vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate) and a physical exam including MRC score are done prior to exercise and IMP intake. During the first 4 hours following IMP intake vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate) and instantaneous serum potassium levels are measured frequently as per protocol. Any reported symptoms or adverse events are recorded. In addition intermittent electrophysiological recordings are taken from the non-exercised hand in order to identify the development of a major attack of paralysis early. At the end of the observation period (4 hours after IMP intake) serum potassium levels are measured by the local hospital laboratory and a physical exam is performed including an MRC score. Safety is also assessed by phone call evaluating adverse events reported by the participants and recorded in a diary occurring within 1 week following each visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age;

          -  Diagnosis of genetically confirmed HypoPP;

          -  Clinical symptoms or signs of active symptomatic disease (at least 1 attack in last 12
             months);

          -  Practising an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the trial. This
             will be addressed on Patient Information Sheet for men and women (section 11.4.5);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent;

          -  People older than 64 years old;

          -  Other conditions causing hand weakness which could interfere with study measurements
             (e.g. due to a stroke, trauma or arthritis)

          -  Patients with a history of cardiac disease, renal failure or moderate to severe
             hepatic disease. Note: abnormalities in serum transaminases are common in people with
             HypoPP as they arise from skeletal muscle rather than any specific liver abnormality.
             Consequently, raised serum bilirubin &gt;20% above the baseline value will be used to
             identify abnormal liver function;

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding;

          -  Patients with a current or previous history of diabetes, porphyria, symptomatic
             hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or difficulty with micturition, allergy to
             sulfonamides or thiazides;

          -  Patients on lithium, digoxin, nephro- or ototoxic drugs;

          -  Patients known to be allergic bumetanide or its excipients;

          -  Patients with a history of inadequately treated Addison's disease;

          -  Patients participating in another interventional trial in the previous 1 month.
