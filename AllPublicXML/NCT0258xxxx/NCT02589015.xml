  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the correlation of neck circumference with difficult
      mask ventilation and laryngoscopy in morbidly obese patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients' Mallampati score, upper lip bite test, neck mobility, teeth abnormalities were
      evaluated preoperatively. Mouth opening, sternomental and thyromental distances, neck
      circumference, thoracic circumference, breast circumference , belly circumference and hip
      circumference were measured preoperatively.

      After anesthesia induciton with propofol and rocuronium, patients' mask ventilation
      difficulty was evaluated as defined below: V1- Ventilated by single anesthesist easily; V2-
      Ventilated by single anesthesist with oral airway; V3- Ventilated by two anesthesists; V4-
      Unable to mask ventilate. V3 and V4 was defined as difficult mask ventilation.

      Laringoscopy was performed with MacIntosh laryngoscop and Cormack Lehane (CL) score was
      evaluated. CL score III and IV were defined as difficult laryngoscopy.
