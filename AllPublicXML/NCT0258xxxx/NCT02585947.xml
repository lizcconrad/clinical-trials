      The objective of this study is to analyze factors affecting Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
      reactivation in anti-HBc positive patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab
      and compare HBV reactivation rates by duration of prophylactic treatment with tenofovir to
      contribute to the establishment of an effective prevention strategy.

      This study will be conducted in a randomized, open-label, multi-center design. On Day 1 of
      chemotherapy, approximately 90 subjects screened and determined eligible will be randomized
      to either Group A or Group B in a 1:1 manner for study participation.

        -  Group A: Upon the EOC, subjects will receive tenofovir 300mg for approximately 6 months
           (24 weeks) and undergo treatment and follow-up every 12 weeks for up to 72 weeks post
           chemotherapy.

        -  Group A: Upon the EOC, subjects will receive tenofovir 300mg for approximately 12 months
           (48 weeks) and undergo treatment and follow-up every 12 weeks for up to 72 weeks post
           chemotherapy.
