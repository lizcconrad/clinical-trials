      This study aims to determine if a silicon-based gel and a silicon-based aerosol are effective
      in the treatment of postoperative scars.

    <textblock>
      Improve the final aspect of scars, have been a challenge for medicine. Silicon based products
      have been used in various ways to prevent hypertrophic scars and keloids since 1980. A great
      percentage of studies shows that silicon-based products improves the aspect of scars in
      different pathologies. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, using
      the Vancouver scale, of two silicon-based products (Kelofin gel and Kelofin aerosol) after
      180 days.

      300 participants that meet all the inclusion criteria and are not classified in any of the
      exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of thre treatment groups( Kelofin Gel,
      Kelofin Aerosol and no treatment) of the study.
