      Objective: To evaluate the relative bioavailability of a new formulation containing a
      combination of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (T) and compare
      this formulation with the branded formulation (R) to meet regulatory criteria for marketing
      the test product in Argentina.

      A randomized-sequence, open-label, two-period crossover study was conducted on 24 healthy
      Caucasian volunteers in a fasting state. A single oral dose of either T or R formulations was
      followed by a 7-day washout period. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 0.25, 0.50,
      0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 7, 12, 24 and 48 h after administration. Emtricitabine and
      tenofovir concentrations were determined using a validated LC (liquid chromatography) - MS
      (mass spectrometry) / MS method. Adverse events were monitored based on clinical parameters
      and volunteer reports.
