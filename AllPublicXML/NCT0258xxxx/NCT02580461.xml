    <textblock>
      The RECHARGE study is evaluating the effect of a 24 week structured exercise and education
      program on the physical and emotion health, quality of life, physical activity and fitness
      levels of family caregivers. Very little research has been done examining the impact of a
      structured exercise program designed for family caregivers of cancer patients. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if physical activity is effective in improving caregiver health
      and well-being.

      The REHCARGE study is a randomized control trial testing a structured exercise program for
      cancer family caregivers. One half of the participants enrolled will receive no exercise
      program until after twelve weeks have passed (the delayed start group) and the other half of
      the participants will start the exercise program right away. In addition to regular
      attendance at exercise classes, participants will also be asked to complete some measurements
      throughout the study including an initial assessment and one after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of
      the exercise programs. If participants are a part of the delayed start group, they will
      receive a fourth fitness assessment. Assessments include an evaluation of physical activity
      levels, quality of life, depression, sleep, and social support through survey type
      questionnaires as well as a fitness assessment to measure overall fitness and body
      composition. Participants will receive an individualized exercise program appropriate for
      their fitness level as well as 6 education sessions about healthy behaviors throughout the
      study.

    <description>One half of the participants enrolled in the 24 week center-based structured exercise and education program will be randomized to the delayed exercise group.

    <intervention_name>A 24 week center-based structured exercise and education program</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will consist of a strength and aerobic exercise program. The exercise program will include twice weekly group resistance exercises classes, twice monthly group education classes, and individual activities to achieve 150 weekly minutes of aerobic activity. The resistance exercise and education classes will be run at a gym space at the University of Calgary. The wait-list control participants will be told not to change their activity levels throughout the 12 weeks of the trial. The wait list control participants will be enrolled into the exercise and education intervention once they have completed 12 weeks of wait-list control. A 12 week maintenance exercise program will be offered to all participants who finish the 12 week exercise and education program. The maintenance exercise program will consist of once weekly resistance group based exercise classes and individual activities to achieve 150 weekly minutes of aerobic physical activity.</description>
