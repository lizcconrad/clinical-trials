      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of physical exercise, associated or not
      with venous compression of the leg, on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and upper
      airway resistance in obese teenagers. Half of the participants will undergo physical exercise
      and compression socks program, and the other half of subjects will undergo physical exercise
      program without compression socks.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important factor of OSA development in children and teenagers, and physical
      activity is a relevant alternative to promote OSA decrease with ou without weight loss.

      Physical activity, beyond the improvement of body composition and exercise cardiorespiratory
      capacity, restricts fluid retaining in the lower limb of the leg by the activation of
      musculovenous pump. Fluid retaining is involved in OSA severity because of nocturnal fluid
      shift from legs to rostral zone which promotes pharyngeal oedema development and upper airway
      collapsibility.

      It has been previously shown that venous compression leads to beneficial fluid regulation in
      OSA subjects and appears as an efficient tool in OSA management.

      To the investigators knowledge no study assess the impact of the cumulative effect of
      physical and venous compression program on upper airway resistances in obese teenager with
      OSA.
