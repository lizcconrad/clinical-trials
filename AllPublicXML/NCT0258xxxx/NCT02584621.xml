  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of an
      electronic personalized health screening app incorporating motivational feedback (i.e. &quot;Check
      Yourself&quot;) to usual care among moderate to high risk alcohol users. The purpose of this study
      is to determine whether Check Yourself is more effective than usual care in reducing alcohol
      consumption and binge drinking and improving quality of care among adolescents receiving
      school-based health clinic services.
