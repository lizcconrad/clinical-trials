      The study will investigate, primarily, the safety, feasibility and tolerability and,
      secondarily, the preliminary efficacy of an allogeneic bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal
      Stromal Cell (MSC) therapy (ORBCEL-M) in study subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
      progressive diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

          -  A documented decline of eGFR of ≥ -10ml/min/1.73 m^2 over the past 3 years or
             documented rate of eGFR decline of ≥ -5 ml/min/1.73 m^2 year based on 3 or more

             likely to pose risk to the patient and that would render the patient unsuitable for
             participation or that could impair patient safety or ability to participate in the
             study, such as active malignancy;

         14. Irreversible disease or condition for which 6-month mortality is estimated to be

             antibody screening with Luminex® multi-antigen beads to detect class I and class II
             MHC antibodies followed by a Luminex single antigen bead assay to determine the
             specificity of any antibody detected. Potential study subjects with positive screening
             for any clinically significant anti-HLA antibody will be excluded and will not be
             eligible to participate in the NEPHSTROM clinical study (MFI&gt;1500);

             Women of childbearing potential can only be included in the study if a pregnancy test
             is negative at the screening visit (V1) and at baseline visit (V2) if they agree to
             use adequate contraception. Adequate contraception is defined as any combination of at
             least two effective methods of birth control, of which at least one is a physical
             barrier (e.g. condoms with hormonal contraception or implants or combined oral
             contraceptives, certain intrauterine devices). Women are considered post-menopausal
             and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
             amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate) or 6 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical
             treatment such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.

         18. Pregnancy or lactating;

         19. Participation in other investigational medicinal product (IMP) trials within 30 days
             before the inclusion or concurrent to this study (18 month follow-up);

         20. Inability to understand the potential risks and benefits of the study;

         21. Legal incapacity.
