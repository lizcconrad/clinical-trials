      The BIS Index, one of the VISTA Monitor output parameters, may be used as an aid in
      monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents;and its usage with certain anesthetic
      agents may be associated with a reduction in primary anesthetic use and a reduction in
      emergence and recovery time.

      However, this equipment does not give the proper anesthetic depth index is a number of
      experimental results have been reported.

      Therefore, the investigators study that the BIS VISTA receives an electroencephalogram (EEG)
      obtained through the depth of anesthesia monitors brain waves to collect statistical data,
      through mathematical analysis to analyze the exact correlation between the patient's brain
      waves and the depth of anesthesia.

      General anesthesia is accompanied during surgery gives a lot of satisfaction and impact on
      surgical outcomes of patients depending on the dose of the anesthetic, as well as operation
      time and intensity.

    <description>Standard monitoring included electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and BIS-VISTATM sensor at OR.
Raw EEG in a steady state was collected for 5 minutes.
Anesthesia was induced with intravenous 1% propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg) and rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg)
Mechanical ventilation was initiated
Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 6-7 %, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5 (fresh gas flow; O2 1.5 L/min and air 2.5 L/min).
On completion of the surgery, all anesthetic gases were discontinued and the FiO2 was increased to 1.0.
After extubation, BIS-VISTA TM monitoring was stopped.</description>
