    <textblock>
      Survival rates in cancer continue to improve, with over 2 million adult cancer survivors in
      the United Kingdom, projected to increase to 4 million by 2030. Around 25% of these survivors
      require treatment for clinical levels of emotional distress. The investigators will conduct a
      phase I open trial to test the potential efficacy of MCT in cancer survivors.

      Survival rates in cancer continue to improve, with over 2 million adult cancer survivors in
      the United Kingdom, projected to increase to 4 million by 2030. Around 25% of these survivors
      require treatment for clinical levels of emotional distress. There is scope for improvements
      in the efficacy of current pharmacological and psychological interventions. Reflecting this
      limited efficacy in the face of the need for psychological treatment, the National Cancer
      Survivorship Research Initiative highlighted development and evaluation of practically
      feasible interventions for depression and anxiety in cancer survivors as an urgent research
      priority. It is recognised that current influential psychotherapeutic approaches need to be
      modified to meet the specific needs associated with cancer. However modifications have been
      pragmatic rather than theory-driven and have not improved efficacy.

      This study addresses the stages of 'development' and 'piloting and feasibility' in
      intervention development, albeit with a relatively well-defined starting point given existing
      evidence for efficacy of MCT in other settings and promising preliminary evidence of
      applicability in cancer. The investigators will conduct a phase I open trial to test the
      potential efficacy of MCT in cancer survivors.

    <description>Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a brief psychological intervention which will be delivered over a course of six, one hour weekly sessions. Treatment will follow a manualised protocol.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Metacognitive Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>MCT helps patients to understand the deleterious and counterproductive effects of responding to negative thoughts and feelings with worry and rumination. Treatment aims to enable patients to exert greater metacognitive control over their worry and rumination. The positive and negative metacognitive beliefs that keep perseverative thinking in place are modified, using verbal and behavioural reattribution and through specifically designed therapeutic methods.</description>
