  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of families in the development of infants is well documented. Previous studies
      found that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is growing concerns in Portugal (Padez,
      Fernandes, Mourão, Moreira, &amp; Rosado, 2004) and in the world (Ogden et al., 2014). More,
      there is evidence that habits acquired in early life might track into adulthood (Lien, Lytle,
      &amp; Klepp, 2001; Lytle, Seifert, Greenstein, &amp; McGovern, 2000; te Velde, Twisk, &amp; Brug, 2007).
      Therefore, there is a need to lock overweight and obesity in early childhood in order to
      contribute to health gains during the entire life cycle. The main purpose of this research is
      to evaluate the impact of an intervention program based on parenting skills and feeding
      practices, on infant's growth, development and adherence to new foods in early infancy

      Methods: 58 infants, 4-12 months from 25 nursery schools participated in this randomized
      trial and were randomly allocated to intervention and control group. Infant outcomes were
      performed at baseline and post-intervention and included anthropometry, dietary assessment
      and temperament. In addition maternal and family outcomes such as anxiety, dietary intake
      were also assessed at both times.

      An intervention program was developed and Implemented according to two terms: educators'
      training with the researchers and the intervention with parents and infants developed by
      trained educators. The training program was developed between December 2013 and February
      2014, according to the topics of healthy eating and nutrition and development of the infant.
      The control group received the standard care.

      It is expected that this intervention program is able to promote healthy feeding practices to
      parents and nursery teachers. The results will be disseminated to the stakeholders and
      policymakers that work closely to the topic of this study. This will include papers'
      publication, participation in national and international meetings, contributing to the
      advance of research in this health area.
