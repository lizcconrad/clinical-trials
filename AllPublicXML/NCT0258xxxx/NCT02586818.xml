    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate and verify the clinical accuracy of the InRhythm PT/INR
      system; a point-of-care, whole blood PT/INR measurement with a reference plasma based PT/INR
      using a laboratory reference instrument and reagent (Sysmex/Innovin) calibrated to the WHO
      rTF09 reference standard.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed at a minimum of three (3) different clinical sites where
      patients' VKA therapy is managed and routine PT/INR monitoring is performed.
