  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intention is to investigate, in healthy humans, effects of 3 commonly used
      sweeteners on cardiometabolic risk markers, cognitive functions, and influences on gut
      microbiota composition.

      Healthy subjects will be included in a crossover study with the purpose to investigate
      effects of 3 commonly used sweeteners on cardiometabolic risk markers, cognitive functions,
      and influences on gut microbiota composition. The subjects will consume each test product for
      14 days in a random order, separated by at least a two-week washout period. On the last day
      in each intervention period, i.e. at day fifteen, the last test portion will be consumed
      together with a standardized evening meal at 9.00 pm. Thereafter the subjects are fasting
      until arriving to the experimental unit. Upon arrival, test variables in blood will be
      determined at fasting and repeatedly for 3h postprandial a standardised breakfast served
      approximately at 8.00 am. Cognitive performance will be determined in the postprandial period
      with tests evaluating working memory capacity, selective attention, psychomotor reaction
      time, and executive functions. After each intervention period, faecal samples will be
      collected for characterization of gut microflora.

    <description>Working memory capacity determined with an oral working memory test composed of short sentences that can be semantically meaningful or not. 3-5 sentences are read to the subject. After each sentence the subject immediately has to reply if the sentence is semantically meaningful or not. After the set of 3-5 sentences the subjects have to recall the first noun in each of the sentences. One test is composed of 12 set with (3-5) sentences.</description>
