      This phase 2, open-label, single arm study aims to evaluate the efficacy of tremelimumab in
      combination with the anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma
      subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) patients remains dismal and effective treatment
      represents a high un-met medical need. Investigators have recently reported promising
      clinical activity of the anti-CTLA-4 mAb tremelimumab in pre-treated MM patients: disease
      control rate (DCR) was 31%, and survival rate at 1- and 2-years were 48.3% and 36.7%,
      respectively. These initial findings were corroborated by a second study in which, based on
      retrospective pharmacokinetic analyses, an intensified schedule of tremelimumab was utilized.
      Fifty-two % of patients achieved a DCR (median duration 10.9 months). These intriguing
      clinical results and the emerging efficacy of immunomodulatory mAb targeting the PD-1/PD-L1
      axis in different tumor types, prompted us to design the NIBIT-MESO-1 study aimed to
      investigate the efficacy of tremelimumab combined with the anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 in MM
      patients.
