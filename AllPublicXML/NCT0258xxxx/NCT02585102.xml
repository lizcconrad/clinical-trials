  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if perceived barriers to vegetable consumption can be
      overcome by making it easier for people eat more vegetables and to see if the effects last
      over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High vegetable consumption is associated with maintenance of a healthy body weight. Americans
      do not eat vegetables in the amounts recommended by the dietary guidelines and interventions
      to increase intake have had limited results. Reported barriers to consumption include not
      knowing how to prepare them and being unused to eating them.To get people to eat vegetables,
      they have to be motivated to do so. Repeated consumption of snack foods increases overweight
      and obese individuals' motivation to eat snack foods. The investigators hypothesize that by
      increasing people's consumption of vegetables by making them easy to eat will increase the
      motivation value of vegetables. For this study the investigators propose to provide
      minimally-processed (cleaned, packaged) vegetables to overweight and obese individuals. The
      motivating value of vegetables will be measured using a computer task where people play a
      game to earn points towards portions of a vegetable or a neutral food (crackers). The
      investigators will determine potential moderators of the increase in the motivating value of
      vegetables such as genetics (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are associated with the
      motivating value of food and whether people substitute eating vegetables for other foods. The
      investigators will also determine changes in adiposity as a result of vegetable consumption.
      Lastly, the investigators will determine if repeated consumption increases psychosocial
      predictors of vegetable intake, such as self-efficacy of eating vegetables.
