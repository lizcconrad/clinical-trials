  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      12 elderly (65-70 years of age) male subjects will be included and complete a double blinded
      cross-over study. They will be habituated for 21 days to either low or high protein intake
      (below 0.8 g/kg or above 1.5 g/kg, respectively). Following a 45 day washout period they will
      switch to the alternate group. At the end of each habituation period, the investigators will
      measure the appearance of labelled amino acids from milk proteins.
