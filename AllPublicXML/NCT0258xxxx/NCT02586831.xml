      To assess whether there is a difference in endogenous insulin secretion, measured as
      stimulated C-peptide secretion (area under the curve during a 4-hour mixed meal tolerance
      test), at the 1 year visit, for study subjects receiving combinational therapy versus those
      receiving placebo. The study will also examine the effect of the proposed treatments on
      immunological outcomes, specifically proportion of regulatory T cells at the 1 year visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need to test therapies that afford long-lasting immunomodulation through
      the combined use of short courses of depleting agents, more chronic use of drugs that promote
      immunoregulation and critically control the rebounding effector populations, together with
      interventions that quell inflammation and support beta cell function and glucose metabolism.
      Such combined regimens would rely on lower doses of many of these agents, for increased
      safety and tolerability. Here, we propose a combinatorial regimen based on the administration
      of drugs that are already FDA approved and marketed, all of which have been used in clinical
      trials in patients with T1D, alone or in some combination. This trial will test if the
      regimen proposed, for the first time combining all of these agents, will be successful in
      preserving insulin secretion in recent onset type 1 diabetes.

    <description>The primary statistical hypothesis to be assessed in this study is whether there is a difference in endogenous insulin secretion, measured as stimulated C-peptide secretion (area under the curve during a 4-hour mixed meal tolerance test), at the 1 year visit, for study subjects receiving combinational therapy versus those receiving placebo.
The study will also examine the effect of the proposed treatments on immunological outcomes, specifically proportion of regulatory T cells at the 1 year visit.</description>
