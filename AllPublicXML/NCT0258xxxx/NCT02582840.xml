    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blind, 3 arm, parallel group, placebo controlled PK/PD study will
      enrol 30 Japanese male and female patients with T1DM and age 18 to 65 years, with inadequate
      glycemic control on insulin defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.0% at screening visit.
      lacebo-controlled design. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the 3
      single-blinded treatment arms; dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. CSII user
      are excluded.
