      Assessing the feasibility of implementing real-time multi-leaf collimator (MLC) tracking to
      account for the relative motion of the moving prostate tumour target and the static pelvic
      nodal target for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The capability of tracking for the
      relative motion of multiple targets will ensure that all the treatment targets receive
      correct dose as prescribed by the doctor and minimise side effects to the critical organs.

      This study will assess the feasibility of implementing real-time multi-leaf collimator (MLC)
      tracking to account for the relative motion of the moving prostate tumour target and the
      static pelvic nodal target for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The capability of tracking
      for the relative motion of multiple targets will ensure that all the treatment targets
      receive correct dose as prescribed by the doctor and minimising side effects to the critical
      organs.

      During radiation treatment, the prostate position will be monitored in real time using the
      KIM technology. The nodal target will be imaged before and after each treatment to evaluate
      the nodal treatment margin. The MLC tracking is implemented by recalculating the radiation
      beam shape fit for the moved prostate and static nodal targets and sending the adjusted MLC
      leaf positions to the treatment delivery system. The actually delivered dose to the patient
      will be calculated after the treatment and compared to the dose without MLC tracking to
      assess the treatment efficacy.

    <description>During Stage 1: Optimise nodal treatment margin, Combined real-time use of 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring' will be used to reshape the radiation beam in real-time. The nodal target position stability will be evaluated by the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging before and after each treatment session for the first 10 patients.</description>

    <description>This intervention uses the simultaneous combined use of two technologies: 'Multi-Leaf Collimator Adaptation' and 'kV Intrafraction Monitoring'. kV Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) measures the motion of tissues targeted for radiotherapy in real time using kV imaging.The multi-leaf collimator (MLC) reshapes the radiation beam to maximise dose to the target tissue and minimise dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. Combining KIM and MLC allows the shaped radiation beam to follow the moving target (the prostate) while remaining fixed on a stationary target (lymph nodes) that are also being treated at the same time.</description>
