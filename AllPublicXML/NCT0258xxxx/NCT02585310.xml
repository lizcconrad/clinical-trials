  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Siriraj Hospital, blood consumption in Cardiac surgery is high (units per patient) and
      frequent (number of patients receiving blood). The incidence of side effects are unknown, as
      is the exact amount of blood used/provided for patients with elective CABGs.

      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the incidence of packed red blood cell
      (PRBC) transfusion in elective CABGs.

    <textblock>
      Three hundred patients undergoing isolated, first time CABGs during November 2011-September
      2013 were prospective enrolled in this observational study. Patients' preoperative variables
      and postoperative outcomes, as well as perioperative transfusion characteristics were
      recorded.
