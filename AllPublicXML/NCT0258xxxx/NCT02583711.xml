  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, which aims to assess how physical activity levels following
      surgical procedures correlate with patient recovery and length of hospital stay, as well as
      the utility of this physical activity data to the postoperative surgical team. Surgical teams
      frequently enquire about their patients' physical activity levels on postoperative ward
      rounds. Although this information is often provided anecdotally by nursing staff and junior
      doctors, there are no objective data made available to the clinician. Such data has the
      potential to supplement other observations (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, temperature) to
      help gain an impression of a patient's recovery and physical status, this in turn could
      provide evidence to help facilitate early discharge as well as to predict medium to longterm
      outcomes. Advances in wearable technology allow the investigators to collect detailed
      information with regard to activity with minimal disruption.

      Recent literature has shown that these wristworn sensors can feasibly be worn in hospital pre
      and postoperatively, with evidence of a correlation between the amount of steps taken
      postoperatively and the length of hospital stay. This study will provide further evidence for
      the usability and utility of wearable sensors in the inpatient surgical setting. It will
      provide supporting evidence for surgeons to confidently analyse and assess patients in
      hospital, allowing for safe and expedient discharge home as well as identify highrisk
      patients who are likely to require extra support and surveillance in the community setting.
