    <textblock>
      Investigation into prehabilitation by increasing the supervision of exercise in patients
      undergoing colorectal resection for cancer and comparing with patients involved in a
      rehabilitation group receiving exercise after surgery.

      The aims of this research project are the following:

      To determine to what extent a structured multimodal prehabilitation regimen, which includes
      aerobic and resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation and psychological coping
      strategies, initiated before surgery, and continued while in hospital and after surgery,
      optimizes the recovery of functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for
      cancer.

      To understand which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation
      interventions and predict change in later outcome measures.

    <measure>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Change in functional walking capacity will be assessed throughout the study according to the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six-minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk; encouragement and feedback are given according to published guidelines.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will be enrolled in a multimodal program before surgery involving supervised exercise, nutrition counseling and relaxation strategies. Supervised exercise is provided once a week for four weeks before surgery as well as during the hospital stay post surgery. Patients are to continue with a home-based exercise program for 8 weeks after discharge.</description>
