  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the abnormalities of bronchial trans-epithelial
      transport of chloride, sodium and bicarbonate in patients with idiopathic dilations of the
      bronchi.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dilations of the bronchi happens for one child over 3000. The extended forms may progress to
      respiratory failure. More than one case over two remains of undetermined cause. If the
      prototype is the cystic fibrosis, other abnormalities of ionic transport may be the cause of
      a failure of mucociliary clearance and enhance the idiopathic dilations of the bronchi.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the abnormalities of bronchial trans-epithelial
      transport of chloride, sodium and bicarbonate in patients with idiopathic dilations of the
      bronchi, in comparison to two others groups of patients (without abnormality of ionic
      transport/with typical cystic fibrosis).
