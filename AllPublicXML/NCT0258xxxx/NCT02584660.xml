    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate that low risk Pulmonary Embolism (PE) participants
      who are discharged from the Emergency Department (ED) to the home environment and treated
      with rivaroxaban as outpatients have fewer total days in the hospital for bleeding and/or
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) events through Day 30 compared to participants who are treated
      with initial hospitalization and standard-of-care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), parallel-group, multicenter (study conducted at multiple
      sites) study to evaluate that low risk PE participants who are discharged from the ED and
      treated with rivaroxaban compared to participants who are treated with initial
      hospitalization and standard-of-care. The study consists of a Screening and Randomization
      Period, followed by a 90-day open-label treatment period, and an end of study/early
      withdrawal (EOS) visit. The duration of study participation for each participant is
      approximately 3 months. The participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      treatments. Safety will be monitored during the study.

    <description>Mean number of days of initial inpatient hospitalization (beginning from randomization to discharge from the hospital) plus any subsequent hospitalization(s) related to bleeding and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) events up to 30 days were calculated.</description>

    <description>Reoccurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed VTE, defined as recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) or new or recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (including symptomatic upper extremity DVT) or VTE related death were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Assessment in Participants by Anti-clot Treatment Scale (ACTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>ACTS is defined as a validated measure for assessing treatment satisfaction. The ACTS comprised of 2 subscales: Burdens (13 items: Item 1 to 13) and Benefits (4 items: Items 14 to 17). The treatment experience scores ranged from 'Not at all' to 'Extremely' on a 5-point Likert scale (psychometric rating); higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Satisfied Using Site-of-Care Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction to Site-of-Care Questionnaire (standard-of-care versus early discharge on rivaroxaban therapy) was administered after 7 days on anticoagulant therapy. Satisfaction to Site-of-Care (hospitalization versus home care) rates the participant's level of satisfaction to care and location with care received as well as preference to location of care provided. Participants rated the 3 items of this scale of 1=Very satisfied; 2=Quite satisfied; 3=Neither; 4=Quite dissatisfied; and 5=Very dissatisfied for satisfaction questions and for the 1 preference question responses included 1=In the hospital; 2=In the community; and 3=No preference. Higher score indicates more level of satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Assessment in Participants by Anti-clot Treatment Scale (ACTS)</title>
        <description>ACTS is defined as a validated measure for assessing treatment satisfaction. The ACTS comprised of 2 subscales: Burdens (13 items: Item 1 to 13) and Benefits (4 items: Items 14 to 17). The treatment experience scores ranged from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely’ on a 5-point Likert scale (psychometric rating); higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Satisfied Using Site-of-Care Satisfaction Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Satisfaction to Site-of-Care Questionnaire (standard-of-care versus early discharge on rivaroxaban therapy) was administered after 7 days on anticoagulant therapy. Satisfaction to Site-of-Care (hospitalization versus home care) rates the participant’s level of satisfaction to care and location with care received as well as preference to location of care provided. Participants rated the 3 items of this scale of 1=Very satisfied; 2=Quite satisfied; 3=Neither; 4=Quite dissatisfied; and 5=Very dissatisfied for satisfaction questions and for the 1 preference question responses included 1=In the hospital; 2=In the community; and 3=No preference. Higher score indicates more level of satisfaction.</description>
