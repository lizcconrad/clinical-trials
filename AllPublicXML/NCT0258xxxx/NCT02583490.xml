  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol proposes a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine whether Low Pulse
      Amplitude Focal ECT (LAP) has a more favorable cognitive profile compared to conventional
      unilateral ECT and that it has similar effects as traditional ECT in reducing suicidality.
      The study will enroll 10 patients recruited from the Medical College of Georgia (at Georgia
      Regents University/Augusta University, GRU/AU) as the only site of the study. Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a course of either RUL LAP ECT,
      or conventional RUL ECT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower amplitude ECT (LAP) has been shown to induce seizures of adequate duration in a single
      titration session. This current study is hypothesized to increase stimulation focality, thus
      hypothetically minimizing cognitive side effects.

      The central hypothesis is that LAP has significantly less cognitive adverse effects compared
      to conventional Right Unilateral (RUL) ECT.

      The study will enroll 10 patients recruited from Medical College of Georgia. Patients
      referred to ECT service in the Medical College of Georgia usually occurs from clinical
      services and private physicians and the study will recruit patients who are clinically
      indicated to do ECT. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a
      course of either RUL LAP ECT, or conventional RUL ECT.
