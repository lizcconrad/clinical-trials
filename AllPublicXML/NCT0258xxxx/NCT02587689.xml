      The purpose of this study is to determine whether autologous T cells bearing chimeric antigen
      receptor that can specifically recognize (Mucin 1) MUC1 is safe and effective for patients
      with relapsed or refractory solid tumor.

                  Refractory or recurrent histologically or cytologically confirmed; unresectable;
                  non-squamous NSCLC must have been tested for epidermal growth factor receptor
                  (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation and if
                  positive should have received appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy prior
                  to enrollment;

               3. Pancreatic carcinoma

                  Patients with histologic verification of carcinoma of the pancreas (T1-3, N0-1)
                  who have undergone surgical resection within the past 4 - 12 weeks. Patients with
                  R1 resections are excluded;

               4. Triple-negative basal-like breast carcinoma

                  Patients with basal-like breast carcinoma must have confirmed triple negative
                  (estrogen receptor negative [ER-]/ progesterone receptor (PR) negative [PR-]/
                  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative [HER2-]) .

          -  MUC1 is expressed in malignancy tissues by immuno-histochemical (IHC).

             contraindications for leukapheresis.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks
             after the last infusion of CAR T cells.
