  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore Magnetic Resonance(MR) perfusion imaging as a biomarker to predict outcome of
      patients with acute and subacute stroke. Contrast bolus perfusion imaging and arterial spin
      labeling were conducted in included patients. Imaging evaluation of hemodynamic status,
      collateral and antegrade flow were assessed. Patients were followed up to record radiological
      and clinical outcome.

      Patients:

      Patients with cerebral ischemia sympton of anterior circulation onset in 48 hours were
      included. Baseline materials, NIH stroke scale score, modified Rankin Scale at admission,
      stroke causes, time from sympton onset to enrollment were recorded.

      Imaging scan were conducted at admission, 7 days after admission and 30 days after admission.

      Imaging protocols:

      MRI scan protocols: T2 weighted image, T1 weighted image, Diffusion weighted image(DWI),
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR), Perfusion weighted image(PWI), arterial spin
      labeling(ASL) with Post labeling delay(PLD) 1.5s and 2.5s, Territory ASL(TASL) (PLD = 2.0s),
      3D inversion recovery (IR)-prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled echo (FSPGR).

      Contrast agent:

      Omniscan 2ml/kg, Inject rateï¼š3ml/s

      Digital subtraction angiography(DSA) protocols:

      Selective angiography and imaging phase from arterial phase to late venous phase.

      Imaging evaluation:

      Antegrade flow assessment from ASL Cerebral blood flow(CBF) map. Collateral flow assessment
      from ASL CBF map, ASL subtraction CBF map, TASL, PWI postprocessing map, FLAIR hyperintensity
      vascular sign.

      Reperfusion assessment from ASL CBF map, TASL Initial infarct volume measurement form DWI.
      Final infarct volume measurement from FLAIR. DWI-ASPECTS. Stroke lesions pattern assessment
      identified on DWI. DSA antegrade and collateral grade using modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral
      Infarction(TICI) scale and The American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic
      Neuroradiology (ASITN) collateral grading system.

      Treatment:

      Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA), endovascular therapy and
      conventional treatment including neuro protection, ante-platelet and statin.

      Follow up:

      Seven days and a month after imaging follow up and clinical stroke event and modified Rankin
      Scale(mRS) record in 1 year.
