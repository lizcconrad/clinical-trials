    <textblock>
      A previous trial performed by our research team, in order to reduce the pain associated with
      intrauterine device insertion, compared the novel technique of IUD insertion under the
      guidance of the trans-abdominal sonography to the traditional method of IUD insertion. It
      came up with the conclusion that the TAS guided IUD insertion is significantly lower in pain
      score and time taken for insertion, when compared with the traditional method. In this study
      our researchers aim to abolish the distracting effect of the technician and the TAS probe
      (which might have interfered with previous results).

    <description>the female will be asked to be full bladder. the trans-abdominal probe will be placed by an assistant on the suprapubic region. under speculum examination, the intrauterine device IUD (TCu 380A) will be placed till it reaches the fundus of the uterus and then released.</description>

    <description>the intrauterine device TCu 380A will be inserted in the conventional method, and checked afterwards by transvaginal ultrasound. the trans-abdominal probe will also be placed by an assistant on the suprapubic region ( the image would be on freeze mode) as it is not actually used , it is just to make the same settings for the participant females.</description>
