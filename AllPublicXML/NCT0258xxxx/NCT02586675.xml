      The purpose of this study is to find out if the investigational drug Ribociclib (LEE011),
      when taken with standard treatment (Tamoxifen +/- Goserelin) is safe and has beneficial
      effects in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women and men who have a type of breast cancer
      known as hormone receptor positive/HER2- breast cancer.

      Phase I Dose Escalation:

      The phase I portion of the study is a dose escalation to confirm the safety of the
      combination and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase II
      Dose (RP2D) for ribociclib with Tamoxifen.

      Phase I will be conducted in all participants with Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+)/Human
      Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer with any prior endocrine therapy and up to three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
      administered in the metastatic or locally advanced setting.

      Phase Ib Dose Expansion:

      Phase I trials are increasingly including dose-expansion cohorts (Ib) after the
      maximum-tolerated dose has been reached to better characterize the toxicity profile and
      identify early signs of efficacy within this specific disease population. The investigators'
      goal is to assess the anti-tumor activity Ribociclib + Tamoxifen and to further evaluate
      their safety in adult patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
      Patients in the phase 1b expansion will have the same exclusion and inclusion criteria except
      that they will only be allowed to have up to two lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
      metastatic setting.

    <description>The Phase I portion of the study is a dose escalation to confirm the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the RP2D for ribociclib with Tamoxifen. DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as having a reasonable possibility related to the study medication, unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 28 days of treatment (cycle 1) with LEE011 and Tamoxifen. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 will be used for all grading. In this study, a DLT will occur if CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia lasts more than 4 consecutive days, if CTCAE grade 3 thrombocytopenia is associated with clinically significant bleeding or if there is grade 4 thrombocytopenia.</description>
