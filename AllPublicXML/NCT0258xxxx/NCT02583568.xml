  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A need for further investigation for fluorescence image-guided surgery in breast conserving
      surgery (BCS) has arisen following the results obtained from a phase I feasibility breast
      cancer trial (BIRDYE study: ABR NL 37479.042011). The aim of this study is to define the
      optimal dose of the fluorescent tracer Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW for intraoperative delineation
      of breast cancer tissue using the improved and optimized fluorescent tracer and camera
      system.
