  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the performance of the POTTER observational study, whose primary objective was to
      collect data on the benefits of secondary prophylaxis versus on demand treatment in terms of
      prevention of bleeding episodes, the present study aims to extend the observation time up to
      10 years, of the same population involved in the previous study.

      The present study has been designed to allow a focus on long term disease-related damage at
      joint level in subjects with severe haemophilia A, as well as on the pharmacoeconomics impact
      of the two different treatment regimens.
