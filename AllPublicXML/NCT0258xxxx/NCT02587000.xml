  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of efficiency of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM) (Ulipristal
      acetate) on bleeding control and pain for patients with adenomyosis and wish to keep
      fertility.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion according to criteria, 2 arms : placebo and Ulipristal acetate (UA) 10mg with
      randomisation, 1 patient with placebo for 3 patients with UA.

      48 patients will be included in this trial. The end point will be the bleeding evaluated by
      Pictorial Blood-loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) score, the amenorrhea rate and the pain
      evaluated with visual analogic scale.
