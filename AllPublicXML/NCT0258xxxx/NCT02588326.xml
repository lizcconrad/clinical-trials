  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently FDA does not accept pharmacokinetic studies to show bioequivalence of
      locally-acting nasal suspension formulations.

      However, bioequivalence is defined as the absence of significant differences in
      pharmacokinetics of therapeutically equivalent drug products compared to the matching
      originally invented drug formulation. These there-called &quot;generic drugs&quot; are then
      interchangeable. Drug companies have to show that their generic version has the same active
      ingredient, the same label, is intended to be used for the same conditions or diseases and
      works at the same rate in the body.

      The aim of the study is to determine if pharmacokinetics is sensitive to differences in the
      particle size distribution of two different nasal suspension formulations of mometasone
      furoate during charcoal block. The result from this study will aid the FDA in finding methods
      to ensure that generic products are the same as the trade name drugs.

      For every subject in this research study the following procedures and scheduling will take
      place.

      During the screening visit the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure
      the subject is appropriate for the study. A physical examination will be performed after the
      vital sign measurements are obtained. Also, nasal spray application training will be
      performed and tolerability to charcoal block will be determined.

      Screening tests will be performed within 30 days of study visit 1 and no later than 2 days
      before study visit 1. There will be 2 study visits in addition to the screening visit, a
      minimum period of 7 days should lapse between the subsequent study visits but no more than 3
      weeks. The total study duration for each subject will be about 4-7 weeks.

      Blood sample collection

      Blood samples will be drawn by inserting an indwelling catheter for blood sample collection.
      Blood samples will be taken approximately 15 minutes prior to the dosing of the product
      (pre-dose sample) and at approximately 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,
      12 and 14 hours post dosing. At each time point about 10 mL of blood sample will be collected
      via vacutainer tubes for plasma preparation and storage. At each study visit a total of
      approximately 160 mL blood will be collected, which makes a total of 320 mL of blood during
      study visits 1 and 2.

      The total amount of blood drawn in this study, including the screening visit, will be 327 ml.
      Additionally, up to approximately 15 mL of blood may be drawn for medically needed additional
      assessments to follow up the screening results. Therefore, in total up to approximately 342
      mL of blood may be drawn from each subject.
