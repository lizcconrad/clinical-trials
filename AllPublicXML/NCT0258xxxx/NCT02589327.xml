      Excessive cardiac fat accumulation have been recognized to be associate to increased cardiac
      and metabolic risk. The aim of this study the effects of exercise in cardiac fat content,
      cardiac function, physical fitness, and metabolic activity in obesity.

      Excessive cardiac fat accumulation have been recognized to be associate to increased cardiac
      and metabolic risk. More effective treatments are needed to induce changes in cardiac fat
      content, body composition, and cardiac fat metabolic activity that result in a reduction in
      cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese population. Despite this need, little is known
      about which mode, frequency, and duration of exercise will allow for greater reductions in
      cardiac fat, improvements in body composition, restoration of a healthy cardiac fat metabolic
      activity, and improvement on cardiovascular risk markers. The aim of this study the effects
      of exercise in cardiac fat content, cardiac function, physical fitness, and metabolic
      activity in obesity.

    <description>The intervention will consist of 3 weeks of whole body circuit training (resistance training) where participants in the intervention group will perform 7 different exercises. The circuit will consist of 10 repetitions per exercise of 7 exercises: leg press, bent-over row, bench press, squats, dumbbell jump squats with raises, dead-lifts and weighted abdominal crunches, with approximately 30 sec of rest in between each exercise (based on the estimated time needed to move from one position to the next). Each participant will move through the circuit 3 times, with 2 to 3 minutes of rest between each round. Intensity will be 6-7 of RPE at the first set, and 9-10 at the third set.</description>

          -  BMI 30-39.99

          -  White/Caucasian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known health problems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease will be
             excluded.

          -  Pregnant females.

          -  Any adults found taking medications that affect endocrine or cardiovascular function
             will also be excluded from the study.

          -  Participants that exercise more than three times per week or strength train more than
             twice per week.

          -  Individuals that have poor venous access or have expressed a fear of needles or having
             blood taken will also be excluded.

          -  Cigarette smoking (current or those who quit within the previous 6 months

          -  Hypertension

          -  Diabetics

          -  MRI exclusion criteria must be observed: must complete a safety checklist that is
             designed to identify metal in your body that could pose a hazard during scanning. Some
             forms of metal are acceptable (e.g., dental fillings after 1970). Tattoos are
             generally not exclusionary, unless they have been inked with metallic dyes. All metal
             must be removed from your body. All female subjects, prior to scanning, are required
             to complete a pregnancy test. Must NOT be claustrophobic or have a history of
             claustrophobia
