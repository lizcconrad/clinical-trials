      This study examines if the internet-based peer support has an effect on the breastfeeding
      attitude or the duration of breastfeeding in preterm infants and their mothers compared with
      mothers with routine care. The factors associated with the initiation of breastfeeding in the
      neonatal intensive care unit will be determined. In addition, the perceptions of the mothers
      of preterm infants about their needs and problems when breastfeeding their preterm infants
      are described.
