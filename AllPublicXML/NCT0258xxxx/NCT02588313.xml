      Aim of the study is to investigate long-term effects of CarelessTM, a Mangifera indica fruit
      powder on microcirculation and endothelial function after supplementation of 4 weeks. Effects
      will be investigated with 100mg and 300mg CarelessTM and compared to placebo.

      Aim of the study is to investigate long-term effects of CarelessTM, a Mangifera indica fruit
      powder on microcirculation and endothelial function after supplementation of 4 weeks. Effects
      will be investigated with 100mg and 300mg CarelessTM and compared to placebo.

      To describe targeted parameter, cutaneous microcirculation will be measured at 1 mm depth as
      well as flow mediated endothelial function at the beginning and end of supplementation, each.
      Furthermore, the parameters will be determined postprandially 1 hour after glucose loading.
      Additionally the influence on the glucose metabolism, as well as on body weight and body fat
      will be documented.

    <description>Measurement of dermal microcirculation using &quot;O2C, Lea Technik&quot;:
Relative peripheral blood flow (LDF)
Venous oxygen saturation (SO2 ven)
Relative amount of haemoglobin (rHb). Delta change of dermal microcirculation from baseline to end of supplementation is investigated. Addi-tionally, the delta change of dermal microcirculation from baseline to end of supplementation post-prandial is determined, which means the evaluation of postprandial effects on reactive hyperaemia index after glucose load.</description>
