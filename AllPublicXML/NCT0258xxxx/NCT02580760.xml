    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional monocentric study will describe transgender men transitioning into women
      and who had cosmetic silicone injection.

      The principal objective is to estimate the prevalence of Transgender with circulating
      monocytes containing silicone vacuoles in blood smears among Male to Female Transgender
      population with a history of cosmetic silicon injections.

      The secondary objectives are to describe the transgender population, to describe the quantity
      of silicone in vacuoles of circulating monocytes, and the association between dermatological
      complications (inflammatory and not inflammatory) and several clinical and biological
      characteristics (HIV status, level of immunosuppression, inflammatory syndrome, quantity of
      silicone which was injected , silicone quantity in blood smears).

      Injectable liquid silicone is a permanent filling product which is no more used in France
      because of a high risk of complications. Cosmetic silicone injection is a common feminization
      approach for transgender populations.
