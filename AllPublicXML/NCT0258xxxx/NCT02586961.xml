    <textblock>
      The combined administration of high dose of oral betamethasone and nebulization of adrenaline
      seems to be an attractive therapeutic alternative for reducing the rate of hospitalization
      for acute bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department. However, it is essential to
      confirm the trend previously observed with this treatment before using it in current
      practice.

    <textblock>
      Rationale: In infancy, bronchiolitis is the most common acute infection of the lower
      respiratory tract and is most often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The
      current treatment of bronchiolitis is controversial. Although meta-analysis of nebulized
      bronchodilators or corticosteroids treatments failed to show any consistent benefits on
      admission rate, they remain widely used in pediatric emergency wards. A recent randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted to
      determine whether treatment with nebulized epinephrine, a short course of high dose of oral
      Betamethasone, or both, resulted in a clinically important decrease in hospital admissions
      among infants with bronchiolitis who were seen in the emergency department. This study showed
      that infants in the epinephrine-betamethasone group were significantly less likely than those
      in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval,
      0.45 to 0.95, P = 0.02). However, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result
      became insignificant (P = 0.07). This synergistic interaction was not anticipated but gave
      hope that the association nebulized epinephrine - short course of oral high dose of
      betamethasone might reduce the risk of hospitalization for infants who consulted pediatric
      emergencies for a moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis. It is therefore required to conduct
      a trial dedicated to this evaluation in the French population.

      Hypothesis: using Epinephrine-Betamethasone allows to reduce the rate of hospitalization of
      mild-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis seen in pediatric emergency departments.
