      This trial is a Phase 1b/2a trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral
      AL3818 to standard platinum-based chemotherapy such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel,
      concurrently and continued as a maintenance therapy for up to 12 months, in subjects with
      recurrent or metastatic endometrial, ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, or cervical
      carcinoma. AL3818 is a novel small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which
      shows highly selective inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFr) and vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Preclinical studies of this agent in mouse
      models, including various cancer xenografts, have demonstrated that treatment of
      tumor-bearing mice with AL3818 induces tumor reductions.

      This study will be divided into two parts. The objective of Part 1 is the evaluation of the
      safety and tolerability of adding oral AL3818 to standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel
      chemotherapy for a cycle of 21 days to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). The
      objective of Part 2 is evaluation of preliminary efficacy and the safety of adding oral
      AL3818 at the RP2D determined in Part 1 to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for 6
      cycles. Continuous maintenance mono therapy with 14 days on and 7 days off regimen at the
      RP2D will be conducted up to 12 months and is extendable beyond until disease progression.
