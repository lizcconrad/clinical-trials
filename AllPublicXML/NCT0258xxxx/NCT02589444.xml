      The objective of this study is to assess the effects of a high-dose vitamin D3 on the
      composition of gut and lung microbiota in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis who are
      vitamin D deficient.

             disease, four months after the start of the study and after 12 subjects were
             randomized, as we considered that these factors may also influence our study
             endpoints. Of the 12 subjects who were randomized, only 4 would have been excluded.
