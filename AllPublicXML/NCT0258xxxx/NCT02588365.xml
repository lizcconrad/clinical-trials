  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if different forms of child-friendly,
      computer-based puzzles and games (&quot;brain training&quot;) targeting executive function (EF) skills
      (i.e., thinking, problem-solving) result in improvements in EF in preschool children with or
      at-risk for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and EF problems. The
      investigators hypothesize that children receiving active &quot;brain training&quot; will show greater
      improvements in EF and related skills immediately after treatment than children receiving
      passive &quot;brain training.&quot; The investigators are also interested in whether any improvements
      in EF and related skills occur or are maintained at 3 and 6 months after completion of brain
      training.

      -  Investigators will talk to you by telephone to determine if your child might be eligible
           for the study.

        -  Children complete two baseline testing sessions to evaluate executive function (EF) and
           related skills

        -  Parents complete a packet of information, including questionnaires about the child's
           behavior, EF, and functional skills.

        -  After completion of the baseline testing, we will inform you of eligibility for the
           &quot;Brain Training&quot; phase.

        -  During &quot;Brain Training&quot; children play online computer games for 25-30 minutes/day (can
           range from 15-45 minutes/day depending on your child's attention, training version
           received, number and length of breaks needed), 5 days a week, for 5-7 weeks to complete
           a total of 25 sessions.

        -  Children return for 3 more time points, immediately after the completion of &quot;Brain
           Training&quot; (1 session), and also at 3 months (1 session) and 6 months (2 sessions) after
           completion of &quot;Brain Training.&quot;
