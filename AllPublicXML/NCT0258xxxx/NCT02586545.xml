    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the effect of a new shared care model for type 2 diabetes
      care and compare it with a standardized care management program in a specialized
      hospital-based out-patient clinic.

      The hypothesis is that participants with type 2 diabetes followed in a shared care program
      will have a comparable outcome in HbA1c to participants receiving standard care.

      The prevalence of patients with type 2 diabetes is in growth globally. In order to secure
      high quality in diabetes care it is necessary to rethink the way in which the care is
      organized. The investigators want to test a new model of shared care across the interface of
      primary and secondary care sector for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk
      stratification level 2. Based on a national and regional risk stratification model patients
      can be stratified to three levels according to risk and complexity of treatment: level 1
      (uncomplicated), level 2 (intermediate risk) and level 3 (high risk).

      The objective of the study is to show equal outcomes among the participants being treated in
      either a shared care program or an established program in a specialized outpatient clinic.

      The study is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. The shared care model will be
      tested during a period of three years. All participants are offered four medical visits a
      year. The shared care intervention consists of one annual comprehensive check-up at the
      outpatient clinic and three quarterly visits at a general practice. The control group is
      followed with four quarterly visits at the outpatient clinic including an annual
      comprehensive check-up. The recruitment period spans over approximately 12 months, and
      participants are randomized to intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio.
