  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      mTOR activation has been shown to be relevant in the development and progression of pulmonary
      hypertension. Inhibition of mTOR has been shown to reverse or regress pulmonary hypertension
      in animal models. ABI-009 is an albumin-bound mTOR inhibitor with improved penetration in
      lung tissue.
