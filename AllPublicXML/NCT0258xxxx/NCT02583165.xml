  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm dose-escalation
      study of MEDI1873 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity,
      pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor
      malignancies
