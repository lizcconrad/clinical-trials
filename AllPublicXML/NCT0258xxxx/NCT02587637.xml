    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective post market observational pilot study is to evaluate the
      effect of DRG stimulation in the management of chronic discogenic pain in subjects who are
      refractory to other available treatments. Selected subjects will not be suitable candidates
      for lumbar spinal surgery and will meet the standard selection process for DRG stimulation as
      routinely utilised in the study centre. Results from this pilot study will inform current
      clinical practice and future comparative studies in this specific population.

          3. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

          4. Chronic low back pain of at least 6 months

          5. History consistent with discogenic low back pain (e.g. Pain produced on lumbar motion,
             significant functional limitation in sitting duration and tolerance)

          6. Neurologic exam without marked motor deficit.

          7. Definite/Highly Probable/Discogenic Pain as confirmed by provocative discography

          8. Low Back Pain intensity should be 6 or higher measured on a NPRS at baseline

          9. Meets all the inclusion criteria for the implantation of a neurostimulation system as
             typically utilised in the study centre

         10. Subject has been screened by a multi-disciplinary panel including a psychologist and
             deemed suitable for implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant/nursing or plans to become
             pregnant during the course of the study

          2. Escalating or changing pain condition within the past month as evidenced by
             investigator examination

          3. BMI ≥35

          4. Subject has had injection therapy or radiofrequency treatment for their low back pain
             within the past 3 months

          5. Subject currently has an active implantable device including ICD, pacemaker, spinal
             cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump

          6. Subject is unable to operate the device

          7. Severe disc degeneration at the affected level as evidenced by &gt;50% disc height loss
             on plain anteroposterior and lateral lumbar radiographs or CT/MRI.

          8. Extruded or sequestered herniated nucleus pulposus at the affected level(s).

          9. Previous lumbar back surgery (e.g. Laminectomy, discectomy or fusion) at the affected
             level(s)

         10. Moderate to severe spinal stenosis due to osteophyte and/or ligamentous overgrowth as
             evidenced by MRI or CT in the previous 6 months

         11. Moderate to severe endplate degenerative changes at the affected levels

         12. Grade 1-2 spondylolisthesis
