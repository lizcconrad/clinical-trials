      The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in
      prostate patients who have been treated with hormonal and radiation treatment after
      biochemical failure

      Original biopsy slides of 65 patients will be collected and reviewed. A tissue used to test
      and map DNA fragments will be constructed from patients who underwent radiation therapy. RNA
      and DNA will be extracted from each slide. This study, if positive, will establish the
      predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer patients. It can lead to
      believe that high-risk prostate cancer patients will benefit from a more aggressive
      treatment.

      An endpoint of this study is to evaluate the relation between the Gleason score and the
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Another is to evaluate the relation between the T-stage and
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

      Areas of prostate tumor will be identified by the pathologist of the study. This will then be
      excised from the paraffin block using a tissue microarray punch. Two punches will be
      acquired: one for RNA extraction and one for DNA extraction. RNA and DNA will be extracted
      using the RecoverAll Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion). Standard protocol for the isolation
      of nucleic acids will be used differing only in the time of protease digestion such that RNA
      is isolated after a short incubation (30 minutes), while DNA is isolated after a longer
      incubation (overnight).

        The original slides of 65 patients with informed consent will be reviewed. Assuming 50%
        Gene-fusion carrier rate, patients with and without markers under the investigation will be
        accrued into this study. The investigators at the treating institutions will submit
        paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from the original pre-treatment diagnostic prostatic
        biopsy, which will be reviewed to confirm the Gleason score and to record other
        histopathologic features, such as the extent of tumor in the biopsies, the number of
        positive biopsies, and mitotic index. The block must be clearly labeled with the protocol
        and case number. A tissue microarray (TMA) containing cores representing clinically
        localized prostate cancers will be constructed from 60 men who underwent radical radiation
        therapy. Three cores (0.6mm in diameter) will be taken from each representative tissue
        block to construct the TMA. Detailed clinical, pathological, and TMA data will be
        maintained on a secure database.
