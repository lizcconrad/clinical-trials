  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While some evidence on weight change elicited from commercially available weight loss
      programs, such as Weight Watchers, is available, there is little evidence evaluating any
      health-related outcomes that result from losing weight through these programs. In addition,
      little data exists on the adherence and satisfaction of these types of programs. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate body weight and health-related outcomes that are achieved from
      participating in a Weight Watchers program, along with program adherence and satisfaction.
      Men and women (N=150) that are participating in Weight Watchers weight loss program will
      undergo assessments at the University of Pittsburgh to evaluate outcomes related to the
      Weight Watchers 6 month intervention. Assessment visits, separate from the intervention, will
      take place at baseline (0 months), 3 months and 6 months for approximately 90 minutes at the
      Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center. Participants will be asked to
      undergo assessments of body weight, height, aerobic stamina, functional fitness, flexibility,
      and complete a series of questionnaires related to demographics, program satisfaction, sleep
      quality, happiness, and food cravings. Adherence to the program will be measured by the
      number of group sessions attended.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a body of evidence that has evaluated the effect of Weight Watchers, a commercially
      available weight loss program, on changes in body weight. The current investigation aims to
      add to this body of evidence by providing additional data on changes in body weight and
      enhance the current evidence-base in regards to evaluating other health-related outcomes.

      There is no evidence that demonstrates whether or not the weight loss as a result of the
      Weight Watchers program elicits changes in health-related outcomes related to aerobic
      capacity, flexibility, functional fitness, sleep, and other psychological measures.
      Additionally, within a scientific research protocol, measures of adherence and satisfaction
      have not been evaluated. This study will evaluate these outcomes beyond weight changes
      achieved across the 24-week program.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality and duration. Participants will be asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline, Months 3 and 6. The PSQI is a validated self-report measure of sleep duration and sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Change in Happiness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire at baseline, Months 3 and 6. The OHQ is a validated self-report measure for broad personal happiness. Respondents rate 29 sentences on a 6 point Likert scale (1, strongly disagree; 6, strong agree).</description>

    <measure>Change in Food Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Craving Inventory-II (FCI-II) is a validated self-report measure for general cravings and cravings for specific types of foods and will be completed at baseline, Months 3 and 6. Respondents rate the frequency of cravings since the last time they completed the survey for each of 33 food items using a five-point Likert scale (1, never; 2, rarely; 3, sometimes; 4, often; 5, always/almost every day). The FCI-II consists of 5 scales (sweets, high fats, carbohydrates/starches, fast food fats, and fruits &amp; vegetables) that constitute the higher order construct of food cravings (the total score).</description>

    <measure>Program Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program Satisfaction. Two parts to evaluate:
Satisfaction Survey. Participants will be asked to complete a program Satisfaction Survey. The Satisfaction Survey is a self-administered survey scored on a 5-point Likert scale.
Open-ended Satisfaction Survey. Participants will be asked to complete a Open-ended Satisfaction survey that consist of 2 open-ended questions, and asked respondents to report on their satisfaction with the dietary plan.</description>

    <description>Data on adherence (attendance at meetings and use of the points system) will also be collected. Attendance data will be recorded by Weight Watchers staff at every meeting. These data will be confirmed by a member of the research staff that will be attending the weekly Weight Watchers meetings. In addition, the weekly weights obtained at the intervention sessions will be provided to the investigators by the intervention staff to allow for examination of the trajectory of weight loss.</description>

    <measure>Change in Aerobic Capacity, Functional Fitness, Balance, Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic Capacity: Participants will complete a 6 minute walk test on a designated walking course. The 6 minute walk test is a measure of functional and aerobic capacity. Participants will asked to walk at a brisk, yet comfortable pace for a total of 6 minutes.
Functional Fitness and Balance: The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests to measure functional fitness.
Flexibility: Lower body flexibility will be assessed through the sit and reach test. The sit and reach is a common test to measure lower back and lower body flexibility. This will be collected 3 times with the best of 3 scores utilized.</description>
