  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel algorithm for bioimpedance measurements to detect nerve tissue, and discriminate it
      from other tissue types has been developed in a porcine model, by analysing a complex
      impedance dataset based on multiple measurement frequencies. It must now be confirm that the
      previous results are applicable in humans. Measurements from 24 predefined needle positions
      will be obtained in 16 of the 32 volunteers that are included in the study (part A). A new
      algorithm to detect nerve tissue will be developed based on these measurement results.
      Further impedance algorithms will be developed for other tissue type. The efficacy of the
      algorithms (sensitivity and specificity) will be evaluated in the 16 following volunteers
      (part B).
