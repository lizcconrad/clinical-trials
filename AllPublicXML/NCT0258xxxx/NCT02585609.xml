  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this clinical study is the objective and subjective measurements of
      sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer using opioids. It also examines sleep
      disturbances and associations between sleep quality and symptoms in order to improve symptom
      management in patients with advanced cancer.

      The overall aim of this study is to improve the clinical understanding of sleep quality in
      patients with advanced cancer using opioids and to improve the understanding of how sleep
      quality may best be measured in order to improve symptom management.
