  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigator's study is to evaluate the causes of feeding difficulty in
      infants. New treatments can be possible only if the cause is known. In this study, the
      investigator plans to evaluate the movement of the muscles in an infant's mouth, throat
      (pharynx) and food pipe (esophagus) that are responsible for moving the food down into the
      stomach and that help protect an infants airway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with chronic feeding difficulties exhibit inadequacy of suck-swallow and breathe
      coordination, regurgitation or vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and airway
      aspiration. Often these infants must rely on feeding tubes, either inserted through the nose
      or surgically placed, to meet their nutrition and hydration needs until they are able to
      orally feed safely, effectively, and efficiently. The process of assessment and treatment of
      swallowing disorders is often stressful for the infants and their providers, including
      parents. The goal of this study is to combine two commonly used diagnostic techniques (video
      fluoroscopy swallow studies and esophageal manometry) to more comprehensively evaluate
      feeding from the mouth to the stomach in infants. The hope is that by doing so treatment
      strategies can be improved.

      Feeding difficulties are complex conditions. Simple solitary therapies are not feasible, and
      compliance is difficult as day-to-day modifications are practiced based on clinical
      relevance. Therefore, to improve recruitment and compliance to feeding therapies (flow
      regulated or thickener use), we have now adopted Parent Preferred Therapy for the feeding
      modification. The treatment arms will still be the same at initiation. Subsequent changes to
      therapies will be measured.

      In addition, we are also embarking on alternate strategies to achieve the original stated
      aims: 1) Mechanisms of dysphagia is ascertained by studying concurrent recordings of VFSS and
      manometry. 2) Feeding outcomes of Dysphagic infants are ascertained by evaluating the
      discharge outcomes and 1-year feeding outcomes among those that had evaluation of dysphagia
      using VFSS. 3) Dysphagic infants that had sequential VFSS and manometry studies are evaluated
      to test which method is a better predictor of stated outcomes.
