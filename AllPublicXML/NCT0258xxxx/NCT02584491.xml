  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the associations between changes in neural activity
      and structure, advanced gross motor skills, gait characteristics, and physical activity
      participation following a gait-related intervention that is based on motor learning
      principles for ambulatory children and youth with hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that in conjunction with a program of motor learning based
      training, functional neuroplastic changes in the involved motor areas will be strongly
      associated with changes in gait and advanced gross motor skills, moderately associated with
      physical activity based participation changes, and will have a fair association with
      structural neuroplastic change.

    <description>The motor learning (ML)-based functional gait-related training program is designed to improve advanced gross motor skills and athleticism. It will involve 45-min sessions twice to three times weekly over 6 weeks for a total of 16 active sessions. A maximum of 7 weeks will be permitted. Each session will consist of 35-min of active training along with a 10-min active warm-up/cool-down that incorporates ML. Scheduling flexibility will promote adherence, with a minimum one day between sessions to provide opportunity for rest. Children will be given a 3- to 5-min mental motor imagery script to practice on days when they do not have active training sessions. The total number of sessions (combined active/imagery) will be five per week.</description>
