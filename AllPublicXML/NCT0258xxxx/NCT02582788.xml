      The current clinical guidelines for management of atopic dermatitis now recommend bleach
      baths. This requires simply the addition of regular household bleach to twice-weekly baths.
      At the Mayo Clinic, dilute acetic acid (vinegar) has been recommended for decades in wet
      wraps to treat patients hospitalized for their atopic dermatitis. However, this practice has
      not been widely adopted in the pediatric dermatology community. Will the use of dilute acetic
      acid (vinegar) in twice weekly baths help manage atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients as
      well as, or better than, the current accepted guidelines?
