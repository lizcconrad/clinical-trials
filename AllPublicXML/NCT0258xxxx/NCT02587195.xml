      National, multicenter study:

      The study consists of 3 periods:

        1. A baseline visit to confirm that patient is still in CIS status. All patients will be
           clinically evaluated for CDMS and an MRI (less than 2 months) will be analyzed to
           exclude MS patients according to 2010 Mc Donald's criteria.

        2. Treatment period with timed evaluations

        3. Post-treatment period: 4 weeks, with 2 visits following study drug discontinuation and
           accelerated elimination procedure. All patients who discontinue the study drug and
           according to investgator's decision, will perform the accelerated elimination procedure
           and the post- accelerated elimination visits (at 2 and 4 weeks after the end of
           treatment (EOT).
