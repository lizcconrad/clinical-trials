  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib and II open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with
      chemotherapy or AZD5069 in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study
      will consist of 2 independent cohorts.
