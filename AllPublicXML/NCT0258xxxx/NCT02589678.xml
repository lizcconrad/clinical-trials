  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and tetanus,
      diphtheria, pertussis, and inactivated polio (Tdap-IPV). The study schedule design is to
      simulate a vaccine efficacy trial to see if single women can participate in studies that
      mimic actual HIV vaccine studies.

      This study will evaluate if women at high risk for HIV infection residing in Lusaka, Zambia
      and Ndola, Zambia are willing to participate and can be retained in future HIV vaccine
      trials. 150 women will be enrolled that are either sex workers or single women that were
      identified at infant vaccination clinics (at risk due to a recent pregnancy indicating
      unprotected sexual contact outside of marriage or cohabitation). Two licensed vaccines will
      be administered as proxies for HIV vaccine administration. The clinic and laboratory
      procedures will simulate HIV vaccine trial procedures and will therefore inform recruitment
      and retention strategies and HIV incidence among high risk women in future HIV vaccine
      trials.
