  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SPRINTT study will evaluate the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention programme
      (physical activity, nutritional counselling/dietary intervention, and information and
      communications technology intervention) compared with a healthy aging lifestyle education
      programme on mobility disability, in non-disabled older people with physical frailty and
      sarcopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the life expectancy in European countries continues to increase, the maintenance of
      physical independence in older persons has become a major public health priority. The ability
      to ambulate without assistance is crucial for independent living and it is often the first
      ability to be lost in the process leading to disability. Older people who have impaired
      walking function need more assistance and are more likely to be placed in nursing homes, have
      a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and hospitalisation, and experience a reduced quality
      of life. The ultimate goals of the Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people:
      multicomponenT Treatment strategies (SPRINTT) project are to offer efficient treatment
      options, based on a multicomponent intervention including physical activity, nutrition and
      information and communications technology, to physically frail, sarcopenic older persons and
      to improve their quality of life. The result will directly contribute to the long-term
      sustainability and efficiency of health- and social-care systems. The conceptualisation of
      physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&amp;S) as proposed in SPRINTT will promote significant
      advancements over the traditional approaches by enabling the precise operationalisation of
      the condition, a clear identification of the affected population and the rapid translation of
      findings to the clinical arena.

    <description>The multicomponent intervention will include physical activity (PA), nutrition and information and communications technology (ICT). The PA will be of moderate intensity and will include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training. Walking will be the primary mode of PA .
The nutritional intervention will combine individual nutritional assessment and personalised dietary recommendations to achieve:
a daily total energy intake of 25-30 kcal/kg body weight;
an average protein daily intake between 1.0 and 1.2 g/Kg/body weight.
The ICT component will involve the use of an ad hoc technological device to record actimetry data to support the elaboration of a personalised training programme.</description>
