  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether micropulse laser (MPL) is different to
      half-dose photodynamic therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central serous chorioretinopathy(CSC) is characterized by serous detachment of neurosensory
      retina which can cause lose in visual acuity.Some studies have shown that Half-dose
      photodynamic therapy(PDT) is effective on CSC,although accompanied with side-effects,such as
      choroidal ischemia, retinal pigmental epithelium(RPE) atrophy,and RPE rip,and with exorbitant
      price.Recent retrospective studies suggest micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be
      effective without obvious complications in this disease. But to date, there is no study on
      effectiveness of CSC between PDT and MPL.

      The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser
      versus half-dose photodynamic therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy.The null
      hypothesis of the study is that there is difference between MPL and half-dose photodynamic
      therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy at first month after treatment.The primary
      outcome measures is the proportion of eyes with complete absorption of subretinal fluid at 1
      month after treatment.

    <description>577nm micropulse laser(577-MPL) will be performed of the areas identified on hyperfluorescent &quot;hot spots&quot; on the mid-phase (3 minutes) fluorescein.Multiple laser spots will be applied, covering the leakage area.</description>

    <description>Half-dose photodynamic therapy (HD-PDT) is administered to the patients. At 15 minutes after the start of the infusion, PDT laser treatment is performed with standard 50 J/cm2 fluency, a wavelength of 689nm, and a treatment duration of 83 seconds.</description>

    <description>All treatments were provided by a single practitioner with the 577-nm yellow laser system(Supra 577nm LaserSystem) in 577-MPL arm. The individual power for the patient was titrated at a normal area of near the affected area in micropulse model.The power titration was started at 700 milliwatt(mW) and then gradually increased until a just visible burn was seen. When this threshold was reached, the power was reduced by 50%, using a 100-μm spot diameter and a 200-ms duration with 5 % duty cycle.</description>
