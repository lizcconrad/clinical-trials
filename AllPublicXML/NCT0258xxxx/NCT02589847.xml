      This study will evaluate efficacy and safety information about RBX2660 for the treatment of
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Enrolled subjects will receive one treatment
      with RBX2660 (microbiota suspension).

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      RBX2660 as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent CDI. The primary
      assessments for this study are (i) to assess efficacy as the absence of CDI diarrhea without
      the need for retreatment with C. difficile anti-infective therapy or fecal transplant through
      56 days after completion of study treatment with RBX2660 and (ii) safety via assessment of
      adverse events. Patients who have had either a) at least two recurrences after a primary
      episode (i.e., at least three episodes) and have completed at least two rounds of
      standard-of-care oral antibiotics or b) have had at least two episodes of severe CDI
      resulting in hospitalization may be eligible to participate in the study. Study visits are 1-
      and 8-weeks after treatment with additional follow-up assessments at 3,6,12, and 24 months
      post treatment.
