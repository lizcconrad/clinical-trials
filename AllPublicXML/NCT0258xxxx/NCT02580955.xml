      A physician initiated trial investigating the LEGFLOW Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral Balloon
      dilatation catheter for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions longer than 15cm.

      Objective: to evaluate the short-term outcome of the treatment by means of the LEGFLOW
      Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral BAlloon Dilattaion for the treatment of long femoropopliteal
      lesions (TASC C&amp;D).

          1. Patient presenting a score from 2 to 5 following Rutherford classification

          2. Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the specified
             times

          3. Patient is &gt;18 years old

          4. Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent,
             prior to enrolment in the study

          5. Patient has a projected life expectancy of at least 12 months

          6. Prior to enrolment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion

          7. Patient is eligible for treatment with the LEGFLOW Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral
             Balloon Dilatation Catheter

          8. Male, infertile female or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable
             method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study
             procedure

          9. De novo lesion located in the femoropopliteal arteries suitable for endovascular
             therapy

         10. The target lesion is located within the native femoropopliteal artery

         11. The length of the target lesion is &gt; 150mm and considered as TASC C or D lesion
             according to the TASC II classification.

         12. The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis &gt; 50% or occlusion which can
             be passed with standard guidewire manipulation

         13. Target vessel diameter visually estimated is &gt;4mm and &lt;6.5 mm

         14. There is angiographic evidence of at least one-vessel-runoff to the foot, irrespective
             of whether or not outflow was re-established by means of previous endovascular
             intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

             vasculitis)

         14. Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, sever COPD, metastatic malignancy,
             dementia, etc.) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the
             study protocol or 1-year life expectancy

         15. Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or non-study

             procedure

         18. Use of thrombectomy, atherectomy or laser devices during procedure
