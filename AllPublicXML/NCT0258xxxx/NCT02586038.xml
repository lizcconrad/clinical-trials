      This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the MLN-DEXAMETHASONE,
      MLN-DEXAMETHASONE-CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, or MLN- THALIDOMIDE-DEXAMETHASONE induction combinations,
      followed by MLN maintenance in newly diagnosed elderly Multiple Myeloma patients.

      183 patients, males and females, older than 65 years old or younger but considered not
      eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation, enrolled in different sites, will
      take part in this study.

      The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use
             two acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
             abstinence) for the duration of the study.

             MM, it is required that they have measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by
             clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan) or an abnormal free

             admitted to this study will be oligo- or non-secretory MM with free light chains only
             in order to maximize interpretation of benefit results
