  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management is crucial for surgical patients. Management of postoperative
      pain entails reducing painful symptoms, improving the quality of recovery and resuming normal
      daily living activities. In addition to the benefits derived from relieving postoperative
      pain in women undergoing cesarean section, prolonged immobility as a result of pain during
      puerperium is associated with risk of thromboembolic disease.

      Postoperative pain has negative physiological and psychological impact on patients'
      well-beings and delays the postoperative recovery. Pain may also impair the mother's ability
      to provide an optimal care for her infant in the immediate postpartum period. Besides that,
      it also reduces the maternal ability to breast-feed her infant effectively.

      Effective pain relief should not interfere with the mother's ability to move around and care
      for her infant, and that it results in no adverse neonatal effects in breast-feeding women.

      Non-pharmacological techniques for reduction of pain are growing rapidly. Spiritual
      intervention with listening to Quran recitations as an adjunctive therapy in the
      postoperative period is a non-pharmacological technique that is inexpensive, non-invasive and
      has no side-effects. Spiritual and Islamic implication could improve postoperative pain 6-8
      hours and 24-30 hours in Muslim patients undergoing abdominal surgery. However, there is
      limited number of published studies on the effect of spiritual and religious intervention on
      pain after cesarean section.

      Listening to Quran recitation elicits a relaxation response of calmness, mindfulness, and
      peacefulness in Muslims. Pray therapy results in optimal harmonization, which improves
      psychological, social, spiritual, and physical health status.

      The current study aims to investigate the effects of listening to Quran recitation on pain
      intensity among patients after cesarean section according to the cultural, social and
      economic differences in Egypt.
