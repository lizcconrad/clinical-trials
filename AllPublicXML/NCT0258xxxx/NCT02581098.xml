    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if elevated wound-edge endothelial miR-200b is a barrier to
      wound healing in diabetic patients and also to determine if ex vivo supplementation of miR-21
      mimic and recombinant MFG-E8 resolve inflammation in wound macrophages isolated from NPWT
      sponges from diabetic wounds. This study will enroll 124 (60 in the miR-200b arm and 64 in
      the miR21 arm) Diabetic Wound patients who have wound tissue oxygenation adequate to support
      wound healing and will be in the study for 14 weeks that includes 4 study visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a 14 week prospective observational study where patients with
      diabetic wounds visiting the Ohio State University Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC) will be
      enrolled. Patients enrolled will be followed for 14 weeks including 4 study visits, initial
      visit (week 0), study visit 2 (week 2), study visit 3 (week 4) and will return for a final
      follow-up study visit 4 (week 14). Standardized Care Outline will be per physician
      discretion. The initial visit will take place during the patients regularly scheduled CWC
      visit and the following will take place: Informed consent will be obtained, Baseline
      demographics, medical history, current labs and medications will be recorded, Wound data will
      be recorded, Ankle brachial index will be completed for patients with leg wounds if not
      already completed per Standard of Care (SoC) since onset of the wound, Wound photographs for
      digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid will be collected (mir200b arm only):
      Fluid will be collected from filter paper method or aspiration method. Wound fluid collection
      will take place before debridement and biopsies.The NPWT sponge will be collected (mir200b
      and miR-21 arm): Wound macrophages, immune cells (miR-21) and endothelial cells (miR-200b)
      will be isolated from wound cells obtained from the sponge dressing of the NWPT. The NWPT
      delivers negative pressure to help promote wound healing. NWPT is a routinely applied to
      chronic wounds as therapeutic modality. The foam dressing to be collected is discarded as
      biological waste at the regular CWC visits. Two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be obtained
      from the patient's physician. One biopsy will be used for LCM (wound-edge endothelial cell
      capture) and immunohistochemistry studies and the other biopsy will be used to determine if
      the wound is infected using quantitative bacterial cultures and scanning electron microscopy
      for biofilm structure detection.

      Patient will return for study visit 2 where the following will happen: Patient data will be
      collected including: medication review, adverse event review wound data will be recorded,
      Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid (miR-200b arm
      only) will be collected, NPWT will be collected (miR-200b and miR-21 arms) and two 3 mm punch
      tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician. Note- These biopsies will be
      optional. At the beginning of enrollment the patient will be asked if they would like these
      biopsies to be obtained. The research personnel will make note of the patients' decision. If
      the wound shows signs of healing and does not show signs of infection (i.e. the wound has not
      stalled in healing for 2 or more weeks or become larger in size) or the wound has been
      declared healed by their physician, the biopsies will not be obtained. Patients will return
      for study visit 3. The following will take place: Patient data will be collected including:
      medication review, adverse event review, wound measurements, etiology, location and duration
      will be recorded, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, Wound fluid
      will be collected (miR-200b arm only), NPWT will be collected (miR-200b and miR-21 arms), Two
      3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician. Note- if the
      subjects wound has been declared healed by their physician, the biopsies will not be
      obtained. Patients will return for study visit 4 where the following will take place: Medical
      Chart review to determine final status of the wound as healed, healing or not healed, Wound
      data will be recorded, Adverse Event review, Wound photographs for digital planimetry to
      measure wound area. The risks associated with this research study are low. There are no
      therapeutic interventions or medications as part of this study to be administered depending
      on the amount of sensation the subject has at the site of the wound. The wound site will be
      numbed by applying local anesthesia as appropriate to the area being biopsied. There may be
      some discomfort with the tissue biopsy procedure. The wound site will be numbed by applying
      local anesthesia as appropriate to the area being biopsied. The amount of pain that occurs
      with wound biopsy will vary from person to person, but all reasonable efforts will be made to
      minimize pain. The biopsy procedure is done within the boundaries of the existing wound to
      avoid giving the patient a separate new wound. Bleeding is a possible complication, but the
      risk is low for the small biopsies and is reduced by using local anesthetics with
      epinephrine, and silver nitrate sticks are available in each room to cauterize biopsy sites
      as needed. Infection is also a potential risk; however, wound tissue biopsies are routinely
      performed as the standard of care in the CWC to diagnose wound infection. The biopsy site
      will be appropriately monitored for infection by the physician managing the wound during
      routine wound clinic visits. The ABI test may result in temporary discomfort around the ankle
      or foot when the cuff is inflated, but does not present any further physical or medical
      risks. The wound fluid collection is non-invasive and does not present any risk. Study
      participants will not benefit directly from participation in this study. This research
      information has the potential of providing considerable benefits to wound care by identifying
      a key player that influences the closure of chronic diabetic wounds. Such knowledge should
      help develop novel biomarker and or miR-directed therapeutic strategies.
