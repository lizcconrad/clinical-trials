      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory Advanced Malignancies.

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-meso vector (referred to as CART-meso cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-meso cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-meso TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-meso cell
      infusions.

      II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-meso cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

      III. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells determine tumor cell killing by
      CART-meso cells in vitro.

      IV. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-meso, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-meso (loss of engraftment).

      V. Determine the relative subsets of CART-meso T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).
