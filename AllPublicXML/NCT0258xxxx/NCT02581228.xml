  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, open label study to establish and validate a prediction technology
      for advanced melanoma patients under the 1st, 2nd and later treatment lines, with the
      immunotherapeutic drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab &amp; Nivolumab, in order to predict response
      rate and disease progression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop a technology application (termed ML-PrediCare), which
      is meant to be a predictive stand-alone software device, to support clinicians'
      decision-making, by predicting the individual patient's response to immunotherapy treatments,
      e.g., in terms of time-to-progression (TTP).

      In Stage I of the study, data will be collected for establishing a training set and assess
      the predictive potential of the modelling technology for the response of melanoma patients to
      immunotherapy. In Stage II of the study, data will be collected in order to establish a
      validation set and test the predictive power of the modelling technology in an independent
      set of patients diagnosed with melanoma.

      Tumor tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease will be collected for
      biomarker analyses. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients treated with the
      immunotherapy drugs (with the previously obtained inform consent form) will be collected from
      the tissue bank of the hospital and according to the European Commission regulations.
