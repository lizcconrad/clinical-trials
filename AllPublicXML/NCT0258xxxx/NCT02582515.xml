  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expert reviews and practice parameter papers recommend behavior therapy as a first-line
      intervention for youth with chronic tic disorders (CTDs) with mild-to-moderate tic severity.
      Although behavior therapies like the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)
      are efficacious in reducing tic symptom severity, only 50% of individuals exhibit a positive
      treatment response. Thus, there is a clear need to identify strategies to improve treatment
      response and/or accelerate therapeutic gains .

      The primary ingredient of CBIT is habit reversal training (HRT), which utilizes both
      extinction and associative learning. Psychosocial treatments relying on these learning
      mechanisms have demonstrated an enhanced and/or expedited therapeutic benefit when augmented
      with d-cycloserine (DCS). This feasibility study will examine the incremental efficacy of
      HRT+DCS over HRT+placebo for tics targeted with HRT. Eligibility criteria will parallel the
      child CBIT trial for generalizability and comparability, with the addition of DCS
      contraindications as exclusionary criteria. Parents and youth will complete a battery of
      clinical assessments to ascertain tic symptoms severity and co-occurring psychiatric
      conditions. Afterwards, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either HRT+DCS or
      HRT+placebo. Instead of a full course of HRT (8 sessions over 10 weeks), a more efficient
      Quick-Win/Fast-Fail trial design will be used that includes a truncated HRT protocol to
      provide results in a more timely fashion. As a result of this trial design, the primary
      outcome of this study will focus on the reduction of bothersome tic severity for those
      targeted in treatment rather than global severity reductions.
