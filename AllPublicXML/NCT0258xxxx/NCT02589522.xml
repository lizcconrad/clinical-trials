      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970
      (VX-970) when given together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors that have spread
      from the original (primary) tumor to the brain. ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving ATR kinase
      inhibitor VX-970 together with radiation therapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell
      lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice
      weekly intravenous (i.v.) VX-970 administered concurrent with conventionally fractionated
      whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with VX-970 starting 18-30 hours after the first dose of
      radiation (but prior to the second fraction of radiation).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidence of &gt;= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months
      post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression).

      II. To estimate the radiological response rates (RR) at 6 months including bi-directional and
      volumetric measurements of lesion size.

      III. To estimate the intracranial 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging
      [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). (Group I) II. To measure cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) VX-970 levels, tumor VX-970 levels, and pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345 and RAD51
      multiplex foci. (Group II) III. Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion and mean ADC measurements in
      DWI. (Group II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970. Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15
      fractions. Patients also receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously (IV) over 60-90
      minutes twice a week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy. Treatment continues for 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior
      to surgery. After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive ATR
      kinase inhibitor VX-970 as in Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3-4 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with 1-3 brain metastases, each &lt; 3 cm by contrast MRI, with stable systemic
             disease and ECOG score of 0-2, who would otherwise be eligible for SRS/stereotactic
             radiation therapy (SRT) alone should not be enrolled into this study unless WBRT is
             recommended due to any medical reasons or logistic limitations as determined by the
             treating physician; patients who develop recurrence post-SRS/SRT or surgery alone and
             are recommended WBRT will be eligible for the protocol

             acceptable), &gt; 1 cm mid-line shift, uncal herniation or significant
             hemorrhage/hydrocephalous (small intra-lesional hemorrhage is acceptable); patients
             with seizure at presentation who have been started on levetiracetam and have been
             stable for 48 hours prior to study registration are eligible at the discretion of
             treating physician

          -  Patients who have received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy for 3 weeks
             before initiation of planned WBRT or patients who have not recovered from serious
             (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 3 or more) adverse
             events from the previously received agents; for oral targeted agents or any other
             investigational agents, at least 4 half-lives of the agent (6 weeks for nitrosoureas
             or mitomycin C) should have elapsed prior to starting study treatment

          -  Patients must not have received prior WBRT (previous SRS/SRT done at least 4 weeks
             from the planned start of WBRT is acceptable); patients planned upfront to undergo
             SRS/SRT/fractionated boosts or neurosurgery after WBRT are not eligible; however,
             these treatments/procedures can be performed once the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
             assessment has been completed, if felt clinically necessary

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with VX-970

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to VX-970

          -  Concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450,
             family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) should be avoided; because the lists of
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of;
             ongoing phenytoin should be either discontinued if clinically safe or transitioned to
             non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptics like levetiracetam with a 8-day washout period
             (half-life 18-22 hours, time to steady-state 4-8 days) prior to first dose of VX-970
             (7-days prior to WBRT)

          -  Patients needing more than 8 mg dexamethasone per day at the time of start of WBRT
             will not be eligible to participate in the study; however, patients will be allowed
             entry into the study if it is medically safe to reduce the daily dose of dexamethasone
             to 8 mg or less from the day of the start of WBRT; the dexamethasone dose for such
             patients may be increased beyond 8 mg per day during the course of treatment if
             medically necessary; this increased need for dose should be communicated to the
             study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would increase the risk of toxicity or limit
             compliance with study requirements; this includes but is not limited to, ongoing
             uncontrolled serious infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at the time of registration,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             symptomatic/uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible

          -  Patients with known diagnoses that are associated with germline DDR defects such as Li
             Fraumeni syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are excluded from the study
