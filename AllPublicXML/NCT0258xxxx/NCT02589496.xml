  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most common cause of cancer related mortality and the
      fourth most common cancer worldwide. The molecular classification of GC and the relevance of
      pre-clinical models are not well established, creating challenges in discovering novel
      molecularly targeted therapies. In order to address these issues, we conducted an integrated
      molecular data analysis of three hundred Asian Gastric tumors through the Asian Cancer
      Research Group (ACRG). We performed an integrated genomic analyses based on target
      sequencing, gene expression profiling, copy number variations, Lauren's histological
      classification, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) status, TP53 status in three hundred GC specimens.

      We first divided GC into four subgroups based on gene expression profiling and TP53 status:

        1. epithelial MSS-TP53 inactive;

        2. epithelial MSS-TP53 active;

        3. MSI; and

        4. mesenchymal.

      With an integrative analysis with target sequencing and copy number variations, epithelial
      MSS-TP53 inactive GCs are characterized by predominantly hypermutated intestinal tumors
      (including majority of mutations in KRAS) with MLH1 loss through promoter methylation and
      MSS-TP53 active GCs are characterized by intact TP53 pathway with high frequency of EBV
      infection or frequently mutated oncogenes (e.g. PIK3CA). MSI subtype with TP53 pathway
      inactive characterized by TP53 loss through deleterious mutations in TP53 or MDM2
      amplification and further characterized by both focal amplifications in oncogenes such as
      HER2, EGFR, cMET, CCNE1 as well as large scale chromosomal gains and losses. The above
      subtypes exhibited differential prognosis with the mesenchymal subtype displaying the worst
      survival (2.2 years) and the MSI subtype the most favorable survival (5.6 years). The GC
      subtypes and their association with prognosis were independently validated in three GC
      cohorts. We additionally showed significant association of global gene expression immune
      patterns, like adaptive immune system and inflammation, as well as expression of PD-L1, with
      the genomic defined subtypes.

      In the phase Ib KEYNOTE-012 study which evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy at 10 mg/kg ever
      2 weeks in patients with gastric cancer were recently reported. Most patients had two or more
      prior lines of therapy. In the study, 41% of evaluable patients showed tumor shrinkage. The
      overall response rate in 39 patients were 31%.

      The preliminary data showed a Not significant correlation between PD-L-1 expression and ORR
      (P=0.071).

      Given the mutual association of tumor genetic markers, gene expression and potential markers
      of response to immune therapy identified through the collaborative work between SMC and MERCK
      MSD and Lilly, we plan to perform a phase II study with integrative genomic analysis (whole
      exome and RNA sequencing) in pre and post biopsy specimens to better define those GCs who may
      benefit from pembro.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The
             subject may also provide consent for Biomedical Research. However, the subject may
             participate in the main trial without participating in Biomedical Research.

          2. Be 19 years of age on day of signing informed consent

             of the tissue sample quality for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat samples may be
             required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained endoscopic biopsy
             specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
             block specimens are preferred to slides.
