    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of circadian misalignment on insulin sensitivity in
      healthy lean subjects in a randomized cross-over design. Subjects will be admitted to the
      research facility for two study periods of 3 and 3.5 days. In one of the study periods, the
      behavioral cycle will be shifted by 12 hours. Insulin sensitivity will be measured with a
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence shows that misalignment of the circadian rhythm (e.g. by rotating shift work)
      impairs glucose metabolism markedly, possibly by decreasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral
      tissues and liver. Nowadays our society is indispensably connected to a lifestyle that allows
      wakefulness at every time of the 24 hours cycle. Social jetlag is a phenomenon that affects a
      large part of the general population, thus circadian misalignment extends far beyond those
      who are on a shift work schedule. Therefore, decreased insulin sensitivity in individuals
      affected by circadian misalignment may help to explain the increased prevalence of T2DM in
      night shift workers that has been found in epidemiological studies.

      The study is an interventional randomized crossover trial in which each subject serves as it
      owns control. For the study, the investigators ask the subjects to participate in two study
      periods, one of 3 days length (control condition) and the other of 3.5 days length
      (misalignment condition). During the 3.5 day misalignment condition, subjects will shift
      their day-night rhythm by 12 hours, which will lead to maximal circadian misalignment.
      Insulin sensitivity will be measured by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Secondary
      parameters will include ex-vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and whole-body energy
      metabolism.
