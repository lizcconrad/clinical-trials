    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of muscadine grape skin extract
      (MGE) in treating patients with malignancy (tumor or cancer) that has spread to other parts
      of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. MGE is a nutritional supplement containing an
      extract of the skin of muscadine grape that has shown anti-cancer activity in laboratory
      studies and may be able to fight or kill malignant cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGE (muscadine grape skin
      extract) after 4 weeks of administration for patients with metastatic cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

      I. To monitor adverse events/toxicity every 4 weeks while on treatment. II. To evaluate
      change in phenolic levels (total and component, blood and urine) from baseline to 4 and 8
      weeks.

      III. To evaluate change in serum cytokines and growth factors from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks
      on MGE.

      IV. To observe the response rate of MGE in patients with metastatic cancer. V. To assess
      overall and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic cancer receiving MGE.

      VI. To assess global quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      [FACT-G] and fatigue (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
      [PROMIS]-fatigue Short Form [SF]) in cancer patients taking MGE.

      VII. To assess adherence to MGE treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive muscadine grape skin extract orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment
      continues for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients experiencing benefit from muscadine grape skin extract may continue treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6
      weeks.
