  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies whether biomarkers (biological molecules) in bone marrow
      samples can predict treatment response to sirolimus and chemotherapy (mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine [MEC]) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk). Sirolimus inhibits or blocks the pathway
      that causes cancer cells to grow. Adding sirolimus to standard chemotherapy may help improve
      patient response. Studying samples of bone marrow from patients treated with sirolimus in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn whether sirolimus reverses or turns off that pathway and
      whether changes in biomarker levels can predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the association between biochemical response and clinical response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate complete response rate of sirolimus MEC in patients with high risk AML.

      II. To estimate progression free survival in this patient population. III. To collect further
      information on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sirolimus in combination with MEC in
      patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of bone marrow samples prior to sirolimus dosing on day 4 and
      within 1 week and no later than day 45 of hematologic recovery. Patients receive sirolimus
      orally (PO) on days 2-9 (loading dose on day 1 only), and standard MEC chemotherapy
      comprising mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes, etoposide IV over 1
      hour, and cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 24 hours on day 4-8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
