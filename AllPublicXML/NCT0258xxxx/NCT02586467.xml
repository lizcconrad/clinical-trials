  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 35,000 Canadians, 65% of men and 72% of women aged 31-50 years fail to consume the
      recommended number of milk and milk product servings (≤2 servings per day). Given the wide
      range of health benefits associated with increased dietary intake of milk and milk products
      the objectives of this study were to conduct a prospective, 5-arm randomised controlled trial
      in order to test the effectiveness of a variety of messages for increasing milk and milk
      product consumption in men and women aged 30-50 years old. The five arms consisted of 4
      messages that contained slightly different content specifically: 1) gain-framed message
      condition, 2) loss-framed message condition, 3) self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message
      condition, 4) gain-framed and self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message condition and 5)
      loss-framed plus self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message condition. It was hypothesised
      that those who receive self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing information would consume more
      dairy than those who received messages without such information. Second, those who received
      gain-framed messages would consume more dairy as compared to those who received loss-framed
      messages. Third, those who received gain-framed messages that include self-regulatory
      efficacy-enhancing information would consume the most dairy in comparison to the other four
      conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in calcium from dairy at 1 and 4-week follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week follow-up, 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Calcium consumed from dairy was assessed using a modified version of the &quot;Calcium Calculator™&quot; developed by the British Columbia Dairy Foundation. The original tool assesses consumption of calcium from a comprehensive list of 30 commonly consumed calcium containing products. For this study individuals were asked to indicate the portions they ate of 10 dairy products included in the list. An explanation of a portion was provided for each item. Milligrams of calcium consumed by participants on the previous day was determined for baseline, week 1 and week 4 follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Self-Regulatory Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immedately after the Intervention (1-day), 4-Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in participants self-regulatory efficacy beliefs was assessed using an 18-item measure at baseline, 1-day after completion of the intervention and at 4-week follow-up. Self-regulatory efficacy beliefs items were context specific. Responses were scored on a scale of 0% (not at all) to 100% (extremely confident) with response options in 10% increments.</description>

    <measure>Outcome Expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immedately after the Intervention (1-day), 4-Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in participants outcome expectations was assessed at baseline, 1-day after completion of the intervention and at 4-week follow-up. The perceived likelihood of positive (16 items) and negative (5 items) outcomes occurring as a result of consuming milk and milk products was assessed using a 21-item measure. Responses were scored on a 9-point scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 9 (very likely).</description>

    <description>Changes in participants outcome values was assessed at baseline, 1-day after completion of the intervention and at 4-week follow-up. The perceived value of positive (16 items) and negative (5 items) outcomes occurring as a result of consuming milk and milk products was assessed using a 21-item measure. Responses were scored on a 9-point scale with a range of 1 (little value to me) to 9 (high value to me).</description>
