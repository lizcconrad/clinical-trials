      This open label, single-arm, Phase 1b study is designed to identify the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) using a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design of the WEE-1 inhibitor AZD1775 when
      added to standard of care chemotherapy (cisplatin) and radiation for the treatment of locally

      This open label, single-arm, Phase 1b study is designed to identify the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) using a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design of the WEE-1 inhibitor AZD1775 when
      added to standard of care chemotherapy (cisplatin) and radiation for the treatment of locally
      advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC). The first cohort will include a
      starting dose of 50 mg AZD1775 given twice daily (BID) for three consecutive days (M-W)
      concomitantly with standard of care cisplatin and radiation. AZD1775 doses will be escalated
      in 50 mg increments up to 200 mg BID (M-W) in subsequent cohorts to determine the MTD.

      Up to 24 patients will be enrolled, depending on the rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
      The investigators plan to characterize the toxicity (and safety) profile of this regimen.
      Secondary objectives include determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; based on
      safety and other data considerations), objective response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks and
      progression free survival (PFS). the investigators will also estimate overall survival (OS)
      if the effective sample size allows. The investigators hypothesize that the investigators'
      proposed regimen is safe, and will yield an improved ORR and PFS over historical controls.
      Correlative studies will be performed on archival tissue, and on optional fresh biopsies
      performed at baseline and mid-treatment. The investigators will explore associations between
      p53 mutational status at baseline as well as changes in checkpoint markers, with ORR, PFS and
      OS. Finally, the investigators plan to describe possible changes in QOL, speech and
      swallowing.

             control methods can be composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a
             hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from

        (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal
        contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains
        an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or
        intramuscular agents).

        have received prior radiation therapy for HNSCC 4.2.3 4.2.3 Myocardial infarction within 6
        months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart

        Bilirubin - Hy's Law', for further instructions 4.2.5 Not deemed a candidate for concurrent
        CRT for medical reasons, such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), or uncontrolled
        diabetes mellitus which in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol
        unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

        4.2.6 Not willing to avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juices, grapefruit hybrids, Seville
        oranges, pummelos, and exotic citrus fruits from 14 days prior to the dose of study
        medication, throughout the study, and until 2 weeks after the last dose of AZD1775 due to
        potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study medication. Orange juice is allowed.

        4.2.7 Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products (ie,
        grapefruit juice) known to be moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, which
        cannot be discontinued 14 days before Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study
        until 14 days after the last dose of AZD1775 (see section 12.5 Appendix E).
        Co-administration of aprepitant and fosaprepitant during this study is prohibited.
        Co-treatment with weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 is allowed.

        4.2.8 AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The use of
        statins including atorvastatin which are substrates for BCRP are therefore prohibited and
        patients should be moved on to non-BCRP alternatives.

        substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (see section 12.5, Appendix E) 4.2.10
        Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the
        absorption of AZD1775 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
        malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) 4.2.11 Receiving or less than 21 days
        since receiving any other concurrent cytotoxic, biologic agent(s) or investigational agent
        4.2.12 Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
        cancers, non-invasive bladder cancer, &quot;low risk&quot; adenocarcinoma of the prostate and
        carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot;
        malignancy if they have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 2 years.
