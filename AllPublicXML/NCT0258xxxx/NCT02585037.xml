  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Kinesio Taping® method, therapeutic bandage, is another feature can be used in physical
      therapy, aiming to muscle enhancement, weakened muscles correction, analgesia, among others,
      by cutaneous stimulation of mechanoreceptors. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of
      the use and effects offered by Kinesio Taping® method, changes in muscle strength of grip in
      normal subjects for clinical application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 45 subjects will be divided randomly into three groups (G1: muscle activation
      technique; G2: muscle inhibition technique; G3: Placebo Effect) aged over 18 years male or
      female, where it will be initially measured the strength of grip with a dynamometer Jamar®
      pressure. Then the Kinesio Taping® bandage will be applied in an &quot;I&quot; format in the wrist
      flexor muscles of a dominant and non-dominant limb in G1, G2, and G3 groups. Investigators
      will follow the application protocol suggested by method of technical. To provide the
      facilitation of muscle activity (G1 group) a Kinesio Taping® bandage will be applied to the
      muscle starting at its origin up to the location of muscle insertion. For inhibition of
      muscle activity (G2 group), the bandage will be placed over the muscle starting at the
      insertion location and ending at the muscle origin. For the control group (G3 group) the
      bandage will be placed from the lateral extremity to the medial axis. The measurement of grip
      strength was carried out in four stages: immediately before placing the Kinesio Taping®, 24
      h, 48 h, and 72 h after its application. After collecting the data statistical Investigators
      will held the analysis of the data.

    <description>To provide the facilitation of muscle activity (G1 group) a Kinesio Taping® bandage will be applied to the muscle starting at its origin up to the location of muscle insertion. Bandage in group G1 will be applied following the protocol proposed by method of technical, which defined the direction of the bandage and an applied tension of 10% to 15% (paper off). With a dynamometer Jamar® pressure the grip strength will be messure in four stages: immediately before placing the Kinesio Taping®, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after its application.</description>

    <description>For the control group (G3 group) the Kinesio Taping® bandage will be placed from the lateral extremity to the medial axis. Bandages in the G3 group will be applied laterally to produce a similar visual effect, which control for the placebo effect, but without tension so that a muscle stimulus will be not generated. With a dynamometer Jamar® pressure the grip strength will be messure in four stages: immediately before placing the Kinesio Taping®, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after its application.</description>
