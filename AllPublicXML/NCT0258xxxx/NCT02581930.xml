    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with stage IV
      melanoma of the skin that has not responded to previous treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate rate of objective response (OR: complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      to ibrutinib administered as single agent in patients with immune checkpoint
      inhibitor-refractory and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor-refractory (if
      B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase [BRAF]V600-mutant) distant metastatic cutaneous
      melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after initiation of ibrutinib in patients with
      immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory and MAPK inhibitor-refractory (if BRAFV600-mutant)
      distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

      II. Estimate overall survival (OS) after initiation of ibrutinib in patients with immune
      checkpoint inhibitor-refractory and MAPK inhibitor-refractory (if BRAFV600-mutant) distant
      metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

      III. Explore the association of ITK protein expression with OR and PFS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore association between other putative targets of ibrutinib (e.g. Tec, ErbB4, Hck,
      Yes, BTK) in melanoma cells, as assessed by 2-color IF in representative tissue sections
      obtained from pretreatment archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks or
      FFPE blocks obtained from fresh tissue biopsy from enrolled patients, with OR and PFS.

      II. Explore ibrutinib-mediated effect(s) on immune cell subsets associated with
      immunomodulation by performing multiparameter flow cytometric analysis in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMC) obtained prior to treatment, on day 29 (i.e., predose day 1 of cycle
      2) following initiation of treatment with ibrutinib, and at the time of disease progression
      (3 time points).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 1 year.

    <description>Assessed by IHC and 2-color IF and analyzed by Aperio imaging. Exploratory analysis will also be performed to assess the predictive ability of each tissue biomarker by fitting logistic model or Cox model with biomarker as a covariate. Antitumor response rate or PFS information will be used to investigate possible cut-points for the biomarker. Logistic regression analysis will be conducted to assess whether a profile of immune response in tumor biopsies (or in peripheral blood) can be developed that distinguishes patients who respond to treatment versus those who do not.</description>
