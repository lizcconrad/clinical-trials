      A Phase 4 study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of monovalent oral polio vaccine
      type 2 in healthy IPV-vaccinated children aged 1 to 5 years in Lithuania.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sabin 2 will be withdrawn from routine use globally from April 2016 as per the SAGE
      recommendations at the time of writing this protocol. After this cessation of OPV2,
      stockpiles of mOPV2 will be maintained for potential use if necessary in response to a future
      outbreak. However, there is a risk of cVDPV2 from Sabin 2 in settings of low population
      immunity. Research is ongoing to develop vaccines that are genetically more stable than the
      currently available Sabin 2-containing OPVs. To generate data on immunogenicity, safety, and
      genetic stability on the Sabin 2 vaccine (mOPV2) and as a future comparator for new polio
      vaccine research after the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, this study with mOPV2 is
      performed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity (humoral and intestinal) and genetic stability
      endpoints of mOPV2 in children aged 1 to 5 years for better understanding of the stockpile
      use of this vaccine, and any potential new polio vaccine with a type 2 component in the
      future.

    <description>Polio Sabin™ Mono Two (oral) is a WHO prequalified, monovalent, live attenuated poliomyelitis virus vaccine of the Sabin strain Type 2 (P712,Ch,2ab), propagated in MRC5 human diploid cells. Each two-drop dose (0.1 mL) contains not less than 105.0 CCID50 of Type 2. Magnesium chloride is used as a stabilizer. Polio Sabin™ Mono Two (Oral) contains trace amounts of neomycin sulphate and polymyxin B sulphate.
One dose of vaccine (0.1 mL) is contained in two drops which are delivered from the polyethylene dropper supplied with vaccine.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 1 to 5 years of age, previously vaccinated with three or four doses of IPV.

          2. Healthy without obvious medical conditions that preclude entry of the subject into the
             study as established by the medical history and physical examination.

          3. Written informed consent obtained from 1 or 2 parent(s) or legal guardian(s) as per
             country regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous vaccination against poliovirus outside the national immunization schedule.

          2. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or known immunodeficient condition
             including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          3. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          4. Major congenital defects or serious uncontrolled chronic illness (neurologic,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or endocrine).

          5. Known allergy to any component of the study vaccines or to any antibiotics.

          6. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned
             administration during the study period.

          7. Acute severe febrile illness at day of vaccination deemed by the Investigator to be a
             contraindication for vaccination (the child can be included at a later time if within
             age window and all in/exclusion criteria are met.).

          8. Member of the subject's household (living in the same house or apartment unit) has
             received OPV in the last 3 months.

          9. Subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unlikely to comply with the
             protocol or is inappropriate to be included in the study for the safety or the
             benefit-risk ratio of the subject.
