  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National clinical trials, phase III, randomized, open, parallel, study of superiority, in
      which three hundred thirty-six (336) participants of both sexes, aged between 18 and 65 years
      will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. The Group 01 will use Cefalium®
      and group 02 will use Tylenol®.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cefalium® is a combination of Caffeine + Paracetamol + dihydroergotamine mesylate +
      metoclopramide hydrochloride. The dihydroergotamine mesylate interacts with the serotonergic,
      dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, but it's mechanism is not totally known. The
      caffeine presents mechanisms that are not totally clear, but it may relieves the pain by
      activating of the central noradenosine pathway (pain suppressing system). The Metoclopramide
      hydrochloride presents an anti-emetic action and prokinetic action in the gastrointestinal
      tract.One of its properties is the inhibition of nausea and vomiting triggered by drugs such
      as ergotamine.Paracetamol, also called acetaminophen is an effective agent analgesic and
      antipyretic with weak anti-inflammatory activity.
