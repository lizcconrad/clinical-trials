  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate how implementing an innovative care model
      that provides the pharmacist access to a patient's vaccine history at the point-of-care
      impacts the pharmacist's ability to identify unmet vaccination needs and increase vaccination
      rates for routinely recommended adult vaccinations.

      This is a multi-site, observational study investigating the impact of implementing an
      innovative care model on the pharmacist's ability to identify unmet vaccination needs and
      increase vaccination rates for routinely recommended adult vaccinations. The innovative care
      model enables the pharmacist to utilize a bi-directional IIS to assess patients' vaccination
      histories, identify unmet vaccination needs, and document the care provided. Data will be
      collected in the bi-directional IIS. Aggregate de-identified data will be reported to the
      researchers at the midpoint and conclusion of the study. The project duration has been
      established to allow sufficient time for each pharmacy to implement the innovative care model
      and monitor each pharmacy for a 6-month study period. The American Pharmacists Association
      (APhA) Foundation has an a priori intent to publish the project results.
