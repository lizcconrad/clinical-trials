  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis and has significant morbidity in
      terms of blindness, stroke, and tissue necrosis. It requires protracted treatment with
      high-dose steroids, and despite this there is a risk of flare during the treatment. Little is
      known about the initial triggers for the inflammatory process, and there are no good markers
      of response or relapse. We will study patients referred with suspected GCA to identify
      important components of the immune response in GCA, and follow them over time to collect
      evidence of how best to monitor their condition.

      Objectives and Study Plan:

      Study Purpose:

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the underlying immunological processes in GCA and
      to study the pattern of expression of immune response over time to give us information about
      how best to monitor GCA.

      End Point:

      The end point will be the final visit of the final patient.

      Milestones:

      The project is in 3 phases. In phase 1 (0-2 years) patients will be recruited to fulfil the
      specified primary and secondary objectives. In phase 2 (0-4 years), these patients will be
      followed up for a total of 2 years each, or until they are discharged from clinic. In phase 3
      (1-5 years), further studies will be defined and tissue and data collected under amended
      ethics.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phenotyping of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in the arterial wall and blood of patients with GCA</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial biopsy tissue and peripheral blood will be collected from patients with suspected GCA. A proportion of these will be diagnosed with GCA and will be the &quot;test&quot; subjects, and a proportion will be diagnosed with other conditions that are not GCA and will be the &quot;controls&quot;. We will use immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy to locate and phenotype ILC in arterial biopsies. We will use semi-quantitative methods (ie cells per random high powered field) to compare prevalence of ILC in tests and controls. We will also isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fresh whole blood, and stain the cells to use flow cytometry to quantify and phenotype the ILC. Tests and Controls will be compared using Mann-Whitney statistical testing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CD70 in GCA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CD70 is a costimulatory molecule which is present for a short time on the surface of activated T cells. CD70 has been studied in other autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus, where it is involved in generating the self-reactive factors responsible for the disease. It is therefore suggested that it might be involved in the development of another autoimmune vasculitis, GCA. We will quantify and phenotype CD70+ve cells in peripheral blood and biopsies of patients with GCA and in controls. We will also measure the levels of the soluble form of its receptor, CD27, in patients and controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IL-7 and sIL-7R in GCA</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>IL-7 is a key cytokine for development of all lymphoid cells, including ILC. Levels of sIL-7R have been linked to active renal disease in systemic lupus, and sIL-7R is suggested as a biomarker of lupus. We will collect serum at several time points from patients with GCA and controls (see primary outcome measures). The level of IL-7 and sIL-7R will be quanitified by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and the results plotted as time series. We will analyse the trends of these series to see how useful IL-7 and sIL-7R may be in monitoring GCA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels over time</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>VEGF is a putative biomarker of GCA. We will collect serum at several time points from patients with GCA and controls (see primary outcome measures). The level of VEGF will be quanitified by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and the results plotted as time series. We will analyse the trends of these series to see how useful VEGF may be in monitoring GCA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pentraxin 3 levels over time</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pentraxin 3 is a second biomarker of interest in GCA, and we plan to analyse its expression in peripheral blood as for VEGF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Archiving of tissue for future studies</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months+</time_frame>
    <description>The cohort of patients recruited to this study represents a valuable resource for future ethically-approved studies of the aetiology of GCA. We believe that the majority of patients would like their donations to contribute to as much research as possible. Therefore we will archive tissue in the form of blood fractions and temporal artery biopsy specimens, as well as linking to anonymized clinical and imaging data. It is planned that the study ethics will be amended with novel substudies as they are designed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or over

             claudication with or without visual loss

          3. Participants must be willing to give informed written consent or willing to give
             permission for a nominated friend or relative to provide written informed assent if
             they are unable to do so because of physical disabilities e.g. sudden onset of
             blindness/vision loss which can be caused by GCA (this will be made clear in the
             ethics approval application)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous diagnosis of GCA

          2. Long term (&gt;1 month) high dose (&gt;20mg per day at any time) steroids for conditions
