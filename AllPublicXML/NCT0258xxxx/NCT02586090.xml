    <textblock>
      The study will pilot a randomized control trial to investigate the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of two distinct parent treatments on a dietary intervention for
      overweight and obese adolescents.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit overweight or obese adolescents (BMI &gt;85th percentile) and
      parent(s) (BMI &gt;25 kg/m2). Families will participate in one of two 4-month treatments: 1)
      TEENS+Parents as Coaches (PAC), engaging parents as helpers in their child's weight
      management, or 2) TEENS+Parent Weight Loss (PWL), engaging parents in their own weight
      management. All adolescents will participate in TEENS+, which includes behavioral support,
      nutrition education, and supervised physical activity.

      For the adolescents, intervention will consist of weekly 1 hour exercise sessions and
      alternating weekly 1 hour behavioral and nutrition group sessions. Parents will also attend
      the nutrition sessions and participate in a behavioral parent-only biweekly group. Parent
      behavioral group sessions will be specific to the treatment arm (e.g. PAC or PWL).
      Assessments will consist of anthropometric measures, psychological surveys, and nutritional
      evaluations. Assessments will be completed at baseline, post-test and 3-month follow-up.
