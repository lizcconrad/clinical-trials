  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this observational study is to understand the role of non-invasive programmed
      stimulation (NIPS) to induce substrate based MMVT in patients receiving new St. Jude Medical
      ICD or CRT-D systems.

      Approximately 50 centers worldwide will participate in the study. Additional centers outside
      the US may be considered, as necessary. The anticipated enrollment duration is 48-60 months.

      This study provides a mechanism for sites to refer subjects for potential enrollment to the
      STAR-VT IDE study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02130765).

      Patients receiving ICD or CRT-D device implant (or have received it within 30 days) may be
      enrolled in the study.

        The primary study population includes patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria,
        has had or will have market-approved St. Jude Medical ICD or CRT-D device systems
        implanted, and has no history of MMVT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient is receiving a new SJM ICD or CRT-D implant system, which has study required
        programing capabilities and is appropriate for remote monitoring. Patients who have
        received the ICD or CRT-D up to 30 days prior to enrollment are also eligible.

        Patient consents to have a NIPS/EP study.

        Patient has documented Ejection Fraction (EF) &lt; 50% and / or Right Ventricular (RV)
        dysfunction.

        Patient has documented structural cardiomyopathy of any kind &gt;1 month.

        Patient is between 18 to 75 years of age.

        Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and has agreed to its provisions and
        provided written informed consent using a form approved by the Institutional Review
        Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient has history of stroke.

        Patient has had ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI); or previous cardiac surgery within
        60 days prior to enrollment.

        Patient is pregnant or nursing.

        Patient has chronic NYHA Class IV heart failure.

        Patient has limited life expectancy according to the investigator (less than one year).

        Patient has had a recent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (&lt; 60 days) or percutaneous
        coronary intervention (PCI) (&lt; 30 days).

        Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study Patient is
        unable or unwilling to cooperate with the study procedures.

        Patient has a prosthetic mitral or aortic valve.

        Patient has mitral or aortic valvular heart disease requiring immediate surgical
        intervention.

        Patient has Left Ventricular EF &lt; 15%.

        Patient has had a previous ablation procedure for ventricular tachycardia (VT), excluding
        remote (&gt; 3 months) outflow tract tachycardia.

        Patient has previously documented history of severe loss of kidney function or kidney
        failure.

        Patient has premature ventricular contractions (PVC) or VT induced cardiomyopathy expected
        to resolve with ablation and will not require an ICD.

        Patient has reversible cause of VT.
