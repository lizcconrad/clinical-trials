    <textblock>
      Melanole, a Nigella sativa (Black Seed) extract , is studied for the treatment of GERD.
      Participants, who meet the inclusion criteria, will be divided into two arms.

      Arm 1: Subjects who meet criteria for GERD will undergo 24 hour pH monitoring.

      Arm 2: Subjects who meet criteria for GERD and who undergo only symptomatic monitoring of
      GERD on treatment.

      All participants will be evaluated before and after the administration of the study product.

    <textblock>
      Volunteers were recruited in Lebanese American University campuses. Those who fit the
      inclusion criteria were allowed to choose between two arms: invasive or non-invasive
      procedures.

      Volunteers who chose to enroll in the non-invasive arm were given the study product directly
      after completing the GERD Q questionnaire. A follow-up by phone was done on day 0, 3 , 6 and
      11. GERD Q questionnaire was repeated on days 11 and 28 along with a satisfaction rating.
      Adverse events were reported on a log sheet.

      Concerning the invasive arm, volunteers were given an appointment at Lebanese American
      University Medical Center Rizk Hospital to place the 24h pH-metry, after study product was
      administered. After 7-10 days, the 24h pH monitoring was done again.
