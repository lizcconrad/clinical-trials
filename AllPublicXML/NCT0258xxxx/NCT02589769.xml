      A randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the effect of substitution of unsaturated
      fat from nuts and oils for saturated fat from meat and dairy foods on serum lipids in normal
      weight and obese subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol.

      Background: Increased intake of saturated fat may influence LDL cholesterol and other
      cardiovascular risk factors different in normal weight and obese subjects. Methods: The study
      is a randomized controlled clinical trial in 84 men and women between 21 to 70 years with
      normal BMI (25 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI 30-45 kg/m2) and elevated LDL cholesterol (&gt;3.0
      mmol/l). Dietary intervention: Randomization will be to one of two balanced weight
      maintenance Mediterranean-type diets that differ in their fat sources: an intervention diet
      substituting unsaturated fats from oil and nuts for saturated fats from meat and dairy foods,
      and a control diet with whole fat dairy and meat with saturated fats that are not fat
      reduced.

      Primary research question: Compare the effect of substitution of unsaturated fat from nuts
      and oils for saturated fat from meat and dairy foods on serum lipids in normal weight and
      obese subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol.

      Secondary research questions: Compare the effect of substitution of unsaturated fat from nuts
      and oils for saturated fat on cardiometabolic risk factors including insulin resistance,
      inflammation and serum PCSK9 in normal weight and obese individuals.
