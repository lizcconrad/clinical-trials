    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate, through a controlled clinical randomized study, the
      effectiveness of sealing carious lesions with composite resin in primary molars. For this,
      healthy children (n=100) with caries lesion reaching to the middle third of the dentin of
      primary molars, will be submitted to different treatments to remove the lesions. These
      patients will be randomly allocated in the following treatment groups: (1) cavity sealing
      (Non-invasive resin based dental sealing) without caries removal; and (2) Partial caries
      removal and Invasive resin based restoration. The clinical and radiographic success of the
      treatment groups will be verified by periodic examination of the restorations by USPHS
      criteria and radiographic subtraction, respectively, which will be checked progression or not
      of injury. The researcher responsible for these assessments will be blind to the study, whose
      evaluations will occur after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment.

    <textblock>
      The present study will be carried out as a randomized clinical study. Primary, occlusal
      caries lesions in children, aged 3-8 years old will be treated by non-invasive resin based
      sealing (n= 50) or resin based restoration (n=50). Randomization between sealing and
      restoration (1:1) was made by for a resercher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and
      kept at the clinics in sealed envelopes. The treatments will be examined clinically and
      radiographically after 6, 12, 24 and 36 years. The treatments are performed and controlled by
      only one practitioner (the main reseacher of this study) from the Federal University of Rio
      de Janeiro, Brazil.

      Sealing: The dentist will use a resin based sealing, and follow their usual clinical
      procedures based on the instructions from the manufacturer and the guidelines from the
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,
      Brazil.

      Restoration: The dentist will use preparation design and a resin based resin restoration, and
      follow their usual clinical procedures (partial caries removal) based on the instructions
      from the manufacturer and the guidelines from Department of Pediatric Dentistry and
      Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

      The prevalence of regression, arrest and progression of sealed and restored caries lesions,
      are computed and related to the clinical and radiological registrations of children, or
      treatment related factors for assessing of statistically significant correlations.

      The influence of each factor on the longevity and need for retreatment of occlusal sealants
      and restorations, will be assessed using apropriate analyses for statistical treatment of
      data.

    <description>Clinical evaluation will be performed through clinical examination after 6, 12, 24 and 36-months. The USPHS criteria for evaluating the marginal integrity of the restoration will be used. Clinical scores: Alfa - Restoration showing continuity with the anatomical shape ; Bravo - Restoration discontinuous with the anatomical shape , but the loss of material is not enough to expose the floor of the cavity; Charlie - Restoration discontinuous with the anatomical shape and the loss of material is sufficient to expose the floor of the cavity; and Delta - mobile Restoration fractured or lost.</description>
