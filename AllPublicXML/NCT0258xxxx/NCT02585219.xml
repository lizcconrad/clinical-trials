  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tracer 11C-methionine (11 C-MET) is used as a specific cell proliferation tracer which
      shows metabolically active tumordeposities. A healthy brain barely takes up 11C-MET, causing
      the difference between the background and the tumor to be realively high. In addition, there
      is relatively little 11C-MET uptake in inflammatory processes. This makes 11C-MET a very
      suitable positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in order to differentiate between tumor
      progression and therapy changes. The latter is a major clinical problem for which further
      investigation is necessary.

      In order to be able to make this differentiation, a direct post-operative baseline scan is
      required. With regard to the advanced MRI sequences, it is known that it is necessary to
      produce the post-operative baseline scan within 48 hours. After that timeframe, operation
      induced changes start to occur, such as granulation tissue. In that case the interpretation
      of the scan is no longer possible. Immediately postoperatively (&lt;48 hours) 11C-MET has never
      been used before. Therefore, it is unknown whether 11C-MET provides a good baseline scan
      directly after surgery. This pilot will investigate the feasibility of this 11C-MET baseline
      scan and comparison the results with the advanced MRI sequences.

      Conventional MRI, advanced MRI and 11C-MET-PET will be conducted on the same day. The
      advanced MRI will consist of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging by contrast
      technique (DSC) and spectroscopy (MRS). The post-operative MRI and PET scan will be produced
      within 48 hours after surgery (with the aim that operative effects are not visible on the
      baseline scan). This corresponds to the current practice of conventional MRI follow-up at the
      end of the radiotherapy.

      The comparison with the pre-operative scan is to assess the viability of the post-operative
      scan. It will assessed whether the preoperative tumor uptake will disappear in accordance to
      the resection, as shown by the advanced MRI sequences. In addition, it will be assessed
      whether there are no interfering postoperative effects. The 11C-MET-PET scans will be
      interpreted in comparison with the quantitative results obtained with advanced MRI sequences
      (perfusion / diffusion / oxygenation / spectroscopy). If an immediate postoperative
      11C-MET-PET proves to be feasible, than this will provide a basis for further research. This
      future research consist out of the differentiation between tumor progression and therapy
      change, one of the most urgent clinical dilemmas in neuro-oncology.

    <description>The 11C-MET-PET within 48 hours postoperatively will be assessed visually and quantitatively and compared with the preoperative 11C-MET-PET scan. The 11C-MET-PET data will also be checked by comparison with the results of the advanced MRI sequences. Specifically the comparison will include evaluation of surgical success (all former positive 11C-MET uptake removed) and evaluation of possible post-surgical effects on the second 11C-MET-PET.</description>

Patients with a second brain tumor, brain surgery earlier or prior radiotherapy to the brain are excluded. Patients with only a biopsy be excluded.
The group will consist of 10 patients. This number may be adjusted for patients who are found to have a different diagnosis after histological examination or fall out. For a pilot feasibility study our experience that a number of 10 patients is sufficient for PET examination.</description>
