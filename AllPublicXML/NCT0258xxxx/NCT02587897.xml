  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most expensive upper extremity work-related musculoskeletal
      disorder, impacting 10 million people annually and costing employers up to $113,695 per
      incident. There is currently no established method to detect this disorder prior to the onset
      of symptoms and nerve damage. Preliminary research suggests that sonography—a relatively
      inexpensive, widely available, increasingly portable technology—can provide a non-invasive
      and pain-free method of early detection that could reduce incidence, improve targeted
      interventions and ultimately reduce costs. The primary aims of this study are to establish
      predictive validity of a novel method for early detection using sonographic imaging and to
      identify task components of intensive functional hand activity associated with morphologic
      changes.

      This longitudinal study will follow dental hygiene students—a high-risk population with
      minimal retrospective and controlled prospective task exposure—for two years and compare them
      to a non-exposed cohort of occupational therapy students to investigate the primary aims.
      This research is directed at the National Occupational Research Agenda's (NORA) Healthcare
      and Social Assistance sector with a focus on the National Institute of Occupational Safety
      and Health's (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment and Musculoskeletal Disorders cross-sectors.
      Intermediate outcomes of this research will establish sonographic imaging as an early
      detection tool for workplace-screening and inform methods for combining measures of nerve
      morphology, neurophysiology, and subjective symptoms for predicting the development of
      work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. This work will also inform the development of targeted
      preventive interventions for task components of intensive hand activities that are related to
      changes in tissue morphology. Identifying morphologic changes in early-stages of pathology
      and the specific task components linked to these changes are the first steps toward early
      detection and prevention of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome.

    <ipd_description>Once manuscripts from the project become available, datasets used to produce manuscripts will be shared with individual peers under the auspices of the PI. Only de-identified data in final databases, will be shared; raw data will not be shared. Data from secondary analyses beyond the specific aims will only be shared under the auspices of the investigators involved. When authorized, data will be made available to requestors under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) using the data for research only, (2) securing the data using appropriate techniques, (3) destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed, and (4) providing the PI with a summary of how the data were used. Requestors agree to protect the intellectual property rights of the PI, or other investigators as indicted, by appropriately acknowledging the source of the data in any document or presentation, which may include oversight or authorship on work that is based substantially on the shared data.</ipd_description>
