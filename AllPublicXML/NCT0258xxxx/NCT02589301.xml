    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (relative bioavailability) and
      pharmacodynamics, after single subcutaneous application, in healthy volunteers of both sexes,
      between pegfilgrastim formulation, produced by Eurofarma Laboratorios S/A and Neulastim®
      (reference formulation), marketed by Produtos Roche Químicos e Farmacêuticos S/A.

      In addition to that, a pharmacodynamics comparison will be performed, through change in
      absolute neutrophil count in leukogram performed in the same time of pharmacokinetics
      analysis collection and through CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood at timepoints 0:00,
      96:00 and 384:00 hours.
