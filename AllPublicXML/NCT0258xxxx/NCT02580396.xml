      This feasibility study will be conducted in order to provide proof of concept for the
      CanADVICE+® system comprising a smart phone app and a healthcare organization server side
      application based on Web 2 technologies. The main objective of this project is to optimise
      pharmaceutical counselling services by providing drug related information, in a digital
      format, to patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving Capecitabine.
