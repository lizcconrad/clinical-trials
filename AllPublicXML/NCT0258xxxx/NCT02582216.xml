  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two objectives. First, to introduce a new virtual reality method that
      incorporates the mechanisms used in mirror visual feedback through a three-dimensional (3D)
      augmented virtual reality system. Second, to evaluate the efficiency of this new method on a
      convenience sample of patients presenting with unresolved neuropathic pain (CRPS, PLP,
      plexopathy, stroke) who were not responding adequately to both pharmaceutical management and
      traditional mirror therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neuropathic pain in the unilateral upper extremity scored by DN4 questionnaire

          -  At least 3 months symptom duration following injury

          -  Minimum pain of 40 on a visual analogue scale (VAS);

          -  A drug treatment regimen that was stable for at least 2 weeks.

          -  Subjects were allowed to participate if they presented with any of the following: (1)
             A CRPS diagnosis, in accordance with the International Association for the Study of
             Pain criteria, Phantom Limb Pain (PLP), or spinal cord injury or plexopathy; and (2)
             an history of being treated before by conventional mirror therapy but, in their case,
             the mirror therapy failed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral injury,

          -  Patients with epilepsy

          -  Side effects known to 3D (such as nausea, cephalalgia)

          -  Cognitive disorder
