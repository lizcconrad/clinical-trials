      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if applying a lidocaine topical solution before
      wounds treatment decreases the pain of the procedure in comparison with placebo solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The manipulation of the wounds for its treatment is a painful process and there is currently
      no marketed any topical drug to decrease this suffering.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that lidocaine topical solution applied prior
      to wounds treatment, reduces the pain of the procedure compared to the treatment done after
      application of placebo solution. In addition, if the process was less painful, the
      consumption of systemic analgesics would be reduced (or eliminated) and, therefore, also its
      secondary effects.

      It is a pilot, single-center clinical trial, prospective, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study that will include 26 patients admitted in Bellvitge University
      Hospital (HUB) who present painful wound treatments.

      The Pharmaceutical Department of HUB prepares a dilution of lidocaine 0.5% in 20ml disposable
      syringes and also identical disposable syringes containing 20ml saline solution (process
      authorized by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Sanitary Products).

      Each patient included will be subject to 6 procedures, randomised according to the sequence
      of treatment ABABAB or BABABA (&quot;A&quot; is lidocaine solution, &quot;B&quot; is placebo solution), according
      to a random list.

      After a doctor of The Pain Department evaluates and includes the patient into the study,
      prescribes the treatment and the Pharmaceutical Department provides 3 identical syringes
      (numbered), for each procedure, to the nurse of the patient. The first syringe will contain
      always saline solution (this is unknown for the patient and the nurse) doing this, the
      investigators obtain the basal pain of each procedure. The other two syringes contain the
      studying solution (lidocaine or saline solution, according the sequence of the random list)
      but always the same solution in both.

      The doctors of the Pain Department ask the patient about the pain before starting the
      procedure and determine according the &quot;Verbal numerical scale&quot; (VNS) from 0 to 10 points. The
      nurse, under sterile conditions, will dampen two sterile gauzes with the solution contained
      in the syringe 1, and will apply on the wound during 10 minutes before starting the
      treatment. After this time, the nurse starts the treatment of the wound and the doctor asks
      again about the pain punctuation on the VNS and register it. All this procedure is repeated
      with the contain of the syringe 2 and register the punctuation. If the procedure is still
      painful, the nurse applies (following the same procedure) gauzes with the solution contained
      in the syringe 3 and the doctor register the VNS punctuation. If even this third application,
      the treatment is still painful, each patient has prescribed a systemic analgesic to be used
      at this point if necessary (it does not matter which analgesic, the best for each patient,
      the only condition is that it can not be modified during the period of inclusion into the
      study, it is, 6 procedures) and the punctuation in the VNS is also registered. Furthermore,
      during each procedure, the nurse and the doctor, control the appearance of side effects and 7
      days after the last procedure, the doctor contacts to the patient for check the clinical
      safety.

      Comparing the procedures carried out after lidocaine solution with saline solution, the
      investigators will evaluate the reduction of pain in the wounds treatment.

    <measure>Register the VNS punctuation during wound treatments to demonstrate pain reduction (less VNS punctuation) when lidocaine solution has been administrated comparing to placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment is done six times (one for each wound treatment). The time frame ranges from the date of randomization to the date than the sixth wound treatment has been done; it is up to 19 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The doctor asks to the patient about the punctuation on the VNS before touching the wound and when the wound treatment starts, it is, 10 minutes later than the dampen gauzes (with the syringe 1 content) has been applied on the wound and the VNS punctuation is registered. The nurse does the same procedure with the syringe 2 content and the VNS punctuation is registered. The syringe 3 content is only applied if the procedure is still painful, and the VNS punctuation is also registered.
This process is done during 6 consecutive wound treatments for each patient. The time frame is up to 19 days because it depends on the need of treatment of each patient: every 24, 48 or 72 hours.
At the end of the study, the investigators, will compare the punctuation registered when lidocaine solution has been administrated with the procedures realized when placebo solution was administrated, to demonstrate if the procedure is less painful (less VNS punctuation) when lidocaine solution was applied.</description>

    <description>If the wound treatment is still painful after application the dampen gauzes with the third syringe content, each patient has prescribed a systemic analgesic to decrease the pain. It does not matter which analgesic, the only condition is that it can not be modified during the period of inclusion into the study, it is 6 consecutive wound treatments. The time frame is up to 19 days because it depends on the need of treatment of each patient: every 24, 48 or 72 hours.
The need of the systemic analgesic to decrease the pain, in spite of the topical solution contained in the three syringes, it is registered for each wound treatment. At the end of the study, the investigators, will assess the requirements of systemic analgesics and if it exists any relation with lidocaine solution or placebo solution.</description>

    <description>All the patients have prescribed a fixed systemic analgesia and rescue systemic analgesia (only administrated if the patient has pain). At Bellvitge University Hospital, the treatment prescription and administration has an electronic registration so, the investigators have the drug, the dose, the route of administration (all this invariable during the patient is included into the study) and the timing registered at the computer.
The investigators will compare if the needs (number of doses) of rescue systemic analgesics decrease during the next 24 hours when lidocaine solution has been applied during the procedure comparing when placebo has been administrated.</description>

    <description>The content of the syringes 1 and 2 will be always applied (the number 1 contains always saline solution to register the basal pain, and the syringe 2 is the study drug: lidocaine solution or saline solution, according to the random list) and the VNS punctuation is registered after both applications. If the procedure is still painful after the content of the syringe 2 application, the content of the syringe 3 is applied (it is always the same study drug that contents the syringe 2 for each procedure) and it is registered as well as the VNS punctuation given by the patient.
At the end of the study, the investigators will determine how many times it has been necessary to apply the third syringe to reduce the pain (less punctuation given in the VNS) and, doing this, determinate if it is necessary one or two applications of the study drug to reduce the pain.</description>
