      This phase II trial studies how well capmatinib, ceritinib, regorafenib, or entrectinib work
      in treating patients with BRAF/NRAS wild-type stage III-IV melanoma. Capmatinib, ceritinib,
      regorafenib, or entrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors matched to the
      tumor-specific fusion kinase in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate tumor stability in melanoma patients treated with kinase inhibitors matched to
      the tumor-specific fusion kinase.

      II. To estimate survival in melanoma patients treated with kinase inhibitors matched to the
      tumor-specific fusion kinase.

      III. To examine the safety and tolerability of kinase inhibitors in patients with melanoma
      with a fusion kinase.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore molecular mechanisms of resistance for patients who progress on therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients with MET fusion receive capmatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients with ALK fusion receive ceritinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients with RET or BRAF fusion receive regorafenib PO QD on day 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients with NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, or ROS1 fusion receive entrectinib PO QD on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then
      periodically.
