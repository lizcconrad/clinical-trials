      The overall goal of this feasibility study is to assess the initial safety and efficacy of a
      novel, intravenously administered cathepsin activatable imaging probe, LUM015, in ex vivo
      far-red imaging of colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers (adenocarcinoma) using the
      LUM 2.6 Imaging Device.

      All subjects will have an established diagnosis of colorectal, pancreatic, or esophageal
      adenocarcinoma and are scheduled for resection of their primary tumors.

      Patients will be seen by their surgeon in an office visit and undergo routine preoperative
      testing within four weeks of their planned surgery. During the pre-surgery visit a complete
      history and physical examination and standard of care pre-operative laboratory studies
      (including ECG) will be performed. On the day of their planned surgery, LUM015 will be
      administered by bolus intravenous injection 2-6 hours prior to surgery in the preoperative
      area. The patient will be monitored for adverse events until discharged from the hospital.
      Follow up of subjects will continue until their first post-operative visit.

      Patients will undergo their planned surgical resection 2-6 hours after LUM015 is
      administered. All the surgical specimens (whether containing normal tissue or tumor tissue)
      will be sent to the pathology suite for imaging with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device and routine
      diagnostic assessment. Imaged areas showing high fluorescence will be marked to guide
      pathology evaluation and determine whether the area contains tumor. Samples of imaged areas
      showing low fluorescence signal will also be evaluated by pathology to determine whether the
      area only contains normal tissue. After imaging, part of this tissue will be fresh frozen for
      correlative studies.

      The patients are expected to be admitted to the hospital for the surgical procedure and
      remain in the hospital post-surgery as indicated and required by the surgeon per standard of
      care treatment. While in the hospital, the patient will be assessed for adverse events.
      Laboratory studies will also be performed during this time as a part of routine post-surgical
      care and to assess for any imaging agent related adverse events.

    <description>The first 3 patients will be injected at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. If no or minimal activity is observed and no serious adverse events occur, the subsequent three patients will be injected with the second tier dose level of 1.0 mg/kg. If no or minimal activity is observed in in the second tier dosing group, and no serious adverse events occur, the following three patients will have the third tier dose of 1.5 mg/kg administered. An additional 12 patients will be recruited at the dose level that produces optimal LUM015 activity. Patients will undergo their planned surgical resection 2-6 hours after LUM015 injection. All surgical specimens will be sent to the pathology suite for imaging with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device and routine diagnostic assessment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed esophageal, colorectal or
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma (inclusive of high grade dysplasia) on a biopsy prior to
             surgery and must be scheduled for surgical resection, inclusive of endoscopic mucosal
             resection, of the primary tumor. Subjects at any cancer stage will be enrolled.
