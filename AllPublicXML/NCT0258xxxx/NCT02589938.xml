  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out what effects, good and/or bad, acupuncture has on
      participants and their xerostomia caused by radiation therapy for the treatment of the
      cancer.

      Patients who have met all eligibility criteria will be randomized to standard oral hygiene,
      standard oral hygiene + true acupuncture twice weekly for 4 weeks, or standard oral hygiene +
      sham acupuncture twice weekly for 4 weeks by a form of adaptive randomization, called
      minimization, because simple randomization could result in covariate imbalances .

      The acupuncture points will be at three sites on each ear (Shenmen, Point Zero, Salivary
      Gland 2-prime), a site on the chin (CV24), a site on each forearm (Lu7), a site on each hand
      (LI 1-prime), a site on each leg (K6), and one placebo needle at Gb32 for a total of 14
      sites. All sites will be applied for 20 minutes. For body points, standardized techniques for
      location will be utilized, which are based on anatomical landmarks as well as proportional
      measurements using the patient's own body. For example, finger breadth is based on each
      patient's middle finger, and the proportional unit of measure, the &quot;cun,&quot; is defined as the
      distance between the two medial ends of the creases of the interphalangeal joints when the
      middle finger is flexed. Earpoint locations will mimic standard practice and be identified by
      the acupuncturists.
