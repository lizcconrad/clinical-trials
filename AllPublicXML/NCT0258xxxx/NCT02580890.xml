      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) is effective in the treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      Randomized, double-blind Controlled Clinical Trial

      Subjects Adults (between 18 and 59 years of age) with ADHD who meet the inclusion criteria
      and who agree to participate in the study Will recruit from advertisements and clinical
      referrals to a PRODAH

      Active tDCS Anode - right DLPFC Cathode - left DLPFC Electric current is 2mA - Current is
      applied for 20 min

      Sham tDCS Same assembly is used Current is applied for 30 sec

      Both groups 5 stimulation sessions on consecutive days

      Following tools at Baseline, 1st week, 2 st week, 3st week and 4st week Adult ADHD
      Self-Report Scale (ASRS) SDS - Sheehan Disability Scale CGI - Clinical Global Impression

    <description>Stimulation will be performed with the anode placed over the right DLPFC, and the cathode placed on the left DLPFC. The applied electric current will be 2mA and is going to be applied for 20 minutes. The electrodes have a size of 35cm ² each and will be covered by sponges soaked with saline. The stimulator to be used will be the &quot;Chattanooga Ionto ISO 13485&quot;. Stimulation will be performed for 5 days, one time per day.</description>
