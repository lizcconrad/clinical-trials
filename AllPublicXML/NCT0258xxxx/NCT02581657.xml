      This study is a randomized, double-blind (Investigator and study subject), placebo controlled
      multiple dose sequential ascending dose study that will enroll up to 47 male and female
      subjects with T2DM in up to four cohorts; (6 active/2 placebo subjects in cohort 1, and up to
      9 active/4 placebo in each subsequent cohort).

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      response of PE0139 in the presence of existing stable non-insulin antidiabetic background
      therapy. Subjects will return weekly for a total of 6 doses of study drug.

      Study remains active, not recruiting as subjects who received active study drug will be
      followed for secondary outcome measures.
