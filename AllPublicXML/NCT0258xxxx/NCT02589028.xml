  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore premeal protein-enriched bar effect in postprandial
      glucose levels and concentration of plasma incretin hormones [glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      and/or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)] in healthy subjects and those with
      type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen subjects with type 2 diabetes treated by diet and/or
      metformin, SU, DPP4 inhibitors will be recruited. Every subject will studied on 2 separate
      days in random order with 1-2 week intervals. These participants will consume protein
      enriched bar followed by a standardized high-glycemic-index breakfast in a hospital setting
      or breakfast followed protein enriched bar in a cross-over fashion. Blood sampling will be
      done at the moment of start of breakfast (0 min) and then 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180
      min. Plasma glucose levels, total/active GLP-1, GIP, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon will be
      measured. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of glucose level and hormone from 0 min to
      180 min will be calculated.
