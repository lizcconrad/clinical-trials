  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial to determine if postoperative ibuprofen after
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair impacts postoperative opiate medication use, Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) pain scores, shoulder range of motion (ROM), and repair integrity.

      Patients will be randomized into two cohorts:

        1. Ibuprofen 400mg by mouth three times daily. Patients will also receive the standard
           opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic
           for postoperative pain control.

        2. Placebo tablet by mouth three times daily. Patients will also received the standard
           opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic
           for postoperative pain control.

      Patients will be screened for the study at the preoperative clinic vist and randomized on the
      day of surgery if they meet our inclusion criteria.

      Postoperatively, they will be seen at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2
      years. Pill counting will be done at the 1 week postoperative visit. VAS pain scores will be
      assessed at every visit. Functional shoulder outcomes including shoulder range of motion and
      the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) survey will be completed at these visits as
      well. The SF-12 health and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) survey will be
      completed at the preoperative visit and final follow-up visit only. We will assess rotator
      cuff repair integrity with ultrasound study at 1 year after surgery

    <description>Patients will be randomized using a computer generated number to received either ibuprofen (400mg by mouth every eight hours as needed) versus placebo for post-operative pain control in addition to opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen). Study doctors or research staff will be given randomly generated treatment allocations within sealed opaque envelopes. Once the patient is screened/qualified in surgery, the envelope will be opened and the patient randomized to the allocated treatment regimen. Patients will be given a two week supply (42 pills total) of either ibuprofen or placebo on the day of surgery upon discharge from the surgery center by a research coordinator.</description>
