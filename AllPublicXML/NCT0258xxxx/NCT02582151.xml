  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic bladder patients may have symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, urgency
      incontinence and voiding symptoms due to bladder dysfunction arising from their underlying
      neurologic condition. Current treatment options are effective for some patients, however many
      patients are not optimally managed due to modest efficacy or significant side effects. Second
      line therapies include intravesical onabotulinum toxin, however it is associated with a risk
      of urinary retention, and patients with neurologic disorders often are unable to perform self
      catheterize due to physical limitations. Sacral neuromodulation is associated with an
      undesirably high cost and potential complications in this population. The use of
      transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is an alternative form of neuromodulation, and it may
      have some potential benefits over percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. While some
      preliminary studies have suggested it may be effective, there are no high quality randomized
      trials. This proposal is a 3 month, randomized, sham-controlled, clinical trial to evaluate
      the short term clinical efficacy of at home transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. Valid
      and reliable patient reported outcome measures, and objective measures of incontinence have
      been included as outcomes.
