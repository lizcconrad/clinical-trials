    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility and
      safety of a single dose of autologous T cells expressing CD22 chimeric antigen receptors
      expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as &quot;CART22&quot;
      cells) administered in split fractions, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent form must be obtained prior to any research procedure.

          2. Relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL:

             a. 1st or greater BM relapse OR b. Any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT and &gt; 100
             days from transplant OR c. For patients with refractory disease: i. &lt; 60 years old
             that have not achieved a CR after &gt; 2 or more chemotherapy regimens ii. &gt;60 years old
             that have not achieved a CR after 1 prior chemotherapy regimen d. Patients with Ph+
             ALL are eligible if they are intolerant to or have failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor
             therapy.

             e. Patients with CNS3 disease will be eligible if CNS disease is responsive to
             therapy.

          3. Documentation of CD22 expression on malignant cells at relapse.

          4. Adequate organ function defined as:

               1. Creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dl

               2. ALT/AST &lt; 3x upper limit of normal range

               3. Direct bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl

               4. Must have a minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea,
                  pulse oxygen &gt; 92% on room air, and DLCO &gt; 40% (corrected for anemia)

               5. Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40% confirmed by ECHO/MUGA

          5. Evidence of disease by standard morphologic or by MRD criteria.

          6. Male or female age ≥ 18 years.

          7. ECOG Performance Status that is either 0 or 1.

          8. No contraindications for leukapheresis.

          9. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C.

          2. HIV Infection.

          3. Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association
             Classification.

          4. Subjects with clinically apparent arrhythmia or arrhythmias who are not stable on
             medical management within two weeks of enrollment.

          5. Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic therapy.

          6. Concurrent use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressant medications. Recent or
             current use of inhaled steroids or physiologic replacement with hydrocortisone is not
             exclusionary. For additional details regarding use of steroid and immunosuppressant
             medications.

          7. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.

          8. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          9. Receipt of a prior investigational study agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
             *Note- patients who have received anti-CD19 CART cells (e.g. CART19/CTL019) on an
             investigational study where cell infusion occurred greater than 4 weeks before the
             screening visit are NOT excluded.

         10. Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of optic neuritis or other
