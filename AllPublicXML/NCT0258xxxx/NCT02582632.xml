    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 is defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drugs without any confirmed quantifiable (≥ LLOQ) post-treatment value before or during that SVR window. Confidence interval calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With On-Treatment Virologic Failure During Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks while on treatment</time_frame>
    <description>On-treatment virologic failure is defined as breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (two consecutive HCV rna measurements &gt; 1 log^10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during treatment) or failure to suppress during treatment (all on-treatment values of HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ) with at least 6 weeks (defined as study drug duration ≥ 36 days) of treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Post-Treatment Relapse12</measure>

    <description>Relapse12 is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ between end of treatment and 12 weeks after last actual dose of active study drug (up to and including the SVR12 window) excluding reinfection among participants with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at final treatment visit who complete treatment and have post-treatment HCV RNA data. Completion of treatment is defined as a study drug duration ≥ 51 days for participants who receive 8 weeks of treatment. HCV reinfection is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after the end of treatment in a participant who had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at final treatment visit, along with the post treatment detection of a different HCV genotype, subtype, or clade compared with baseline, as determined by phylogenetic analysis of the NS3 or NS5A, and/or NS5B gene sequences.
