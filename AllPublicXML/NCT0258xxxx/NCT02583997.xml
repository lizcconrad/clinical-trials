  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate postoperative pain (measured by visual
      analogue scale (VAS) on day 2 post surgery) in patients operated for avulsion of four wisdom
      teeth under general anesthesia and for whom the resulting alveoli were NOT sutured versus a
      similar group of patients undergoing standard care (suturing for lower alveoli).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following between the two study
      arms:

      A. Pain at day 31 B. Operative time C. Edema D. Trismus E. The occurrence of complications F.
      Alveolar flap healing G. The impact of smoking on the occurrence of complications H. The
      consumption of analgesics and use of local pain remedies I. Impact on quality of life
