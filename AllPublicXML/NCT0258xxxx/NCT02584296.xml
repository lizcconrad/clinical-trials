      Physical Activity as a Self-Management Approach to Improve Health Outcomes in Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model and using a quasi-experimental
      cohort control research design, the primary aim of this study is to: Determine the
      feasibility of the biobehavioral self management approach (BSMA) program involving physical
      activity (PA) in patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML. The primary feasibility
      outcomes for this aim will be rates of recruitment, refusal, retention and attrition; in
      addition investigators will test methods and procedures of the prescribed BSMA PA program,
      including assessing adherence, participant acceptance and perceived benefit.

    <description>These aggregated rates will help determine the feasibility of the biobehavioral self-management approach (BSMA) program involving physical activity (PA) in patients receiving consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary aim of this study rates of recruitment, refusal, retention, and attrition in the BSMA program for patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML will be reported rates of recruitment (number enrolled, refused), retention, and adherence (trends in exercise capacity as measured by 6minute walk test, strength test and chair to stand test; completed physical activity log; and accelerometer data).</description>

    <description>Biobehavioral self-management approach (BSMA) intervention is aligned with information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model and is guided physical activity (PA). Collects demographic, medical, disease, treatment data, blood specimens and the battery of measures. Includes PA self-assessment, 6 minute walk test(6MWT) and chair squat test (CST) with Physical Therapist (PT); provides PA handouts based on American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines, discusses known benefits, beliefs and goals of PA (IMB health behavior motivation); assess/discuss perceived barriers to PA. PT or Exercise physiologist (EP) works with subject on various exercises (both strength and aerobic, ~30 minutes; IMB behavioral skills);PT or EP reviews exercises, subject practices, and provides a BSMA program (including strength/aerobic training) for subject to begin upon discharge. Subject keeps journal of PA and wears accelerometer (TAA) to record PA levels. 3-weeks at home study nurse calls subjects each week.</description>
