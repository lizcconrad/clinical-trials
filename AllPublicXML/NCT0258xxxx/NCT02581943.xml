    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab with or without
      carboplatin and paclitaxel on immune response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      that has come back or stage IIIB-IV. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may improve immune
      responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the immune effects of single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. Estimate the treatment response to single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined
      with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. Assess quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving single agent pembrolizumab and
      pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      III. Assess the association between immune response and clinical response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 7 and 14.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then
      every 8 weeks thereafter.
