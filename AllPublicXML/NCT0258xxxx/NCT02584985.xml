  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard surgical treatment of mid and low rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME).
      Originally performed by open surgery, TME demonstrated improved local control and reduced
      urogenital morbidity. Laparoscopic approach has been validated by several randomised
      controlled trials: laparoscopic approach offers to the patient a better post-operative
      recovery, a lower risk of wound hernia and comparable oncological results. However, the risk
      of conversion to open procedure remains significant.

      Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy allows retrograd mesorectal excision, performing the whole
      pelvic dissection via a specific-moderate cost device. The procedure is then completed by a
      briefer transabdominal laparoscopic step to mobilise the colon and perform inferior
      mesenteric vessels ligation, prior to low coloanal anastomosis. The originality of this
      approach is to perform a surgical dissection via an extra peritoneal route, without
      peritoneal and abdominal wound trauma. This focuses on new technical improvement in the area
      of mini-invasive pelviabdominal surgery using natural orifice as surgical access. This
      approach offer closer and better exposure of pelvic dissection plane and could improve
      oncological quality and pelvic nerve preservation. It could be profitable to postoperative
      patient outcome. However rates and type of cancer-recurrences as well as functional results
      have to be assessed in a controlled study. This technique has shown to be feasible and
      reproducible through early clinical series. Conversion rates appear to be lower than
      published rates of laparoscopic approach, markedly inferior to 10%. Compiled rates of
      morbidity (27.8%), R1 resection* (6%), mesorectum macroscopic integrity (100%) appear to be
      comparable to laparoscopic approach results. However functional results as well as urologic
      morbidity have to be evaluated in comparative studies. In a preliminary retrospective
      comparative (n=72) we founded comparable oncological quality criteria (R1 resection 5.9% vs
      10.5% p 0.74, Grade 3 mesorectal integrity 57.5 vs 56.2 p 0.99), lower conversion rate to
      open procedure (2.9% vs 23.6% p 0.011), shorter in-hospital stay (8 vs 9 days p 0.038).
      Comparable morbidity rates (Dindo 1-4 27% vs 34% p 0.52) and functional results (Kirwan 1/2
      80.3% vs 80.6% p 0.94) were also founded. These data need to be confirmed. To this date,
      Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy has been evaluated through preliminary studies including
      several short series demonstrating the feasibility of the technique and showing low
      morbidity. For some authors the benefit of transanal approach is significant in difficult
      cases such as male patient and narrow pelvis. Very recently, two non randomised comparative
      studies were published with conclusions close to those in our study.

      Investigators propose, with the support of the GRECCAR group, to conduct a national,
      multicenter, open-label randomized study based on oncological non-inferiority (R1 resection
      rate) for the main objective, comparing Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy to Standard
      Transabdominal Laparoscopic Proctectomy, for low lying rectal cancer requiring manual
      colo-anal anastomosis. There is a clear expected benefit expected for the patients through
      the ETAP procedure in term of post operative short term outcome, risk of conversion to open
      procedure, risk of wound hernia.This trial could also show significant advantages in terms of
      quality of dissection, quality of the specimen, quality of nerve preservation.

      The main objective of study is to assess if R1 resection rate of Endoscopic Transanal
      Proctectomy (ETAP) is not meaningfully inferior to Standard Laparoscopic TME for low lying
      rectal cancer requiring manual colo-anal anastomosis. The secondary objective will evaluate
      conversion rate, mini invasive level of abdominal approach postoperative morbidity, In
      hospital length of stay, Mesorectum macroscopic assessment, Functional urologic and sexual
      results, Fecal Continency, global QoL, stoma-free survival, disease-free survival at 3 years.
      Patients with non metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma requiring coloanal anastomosis will be
      considered for the study. Based on the non-inferiority hypothesis, the population estimated
      in this study at 226 patients, 113 for each arm. Inclusion period will be 3 years, the study
      will be running for 6 years.
