  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AZD0156 is safe, what is the best dose to
      give, and how it is processed by the body when given alone or in combination with other
      agents. The study will also collect some initial information about how effective it is.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a number of study modules, each evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of AZD0156 with a specific combination agent. The combination option may require
      an initial monotherapy dose escalation to gain an understanding of pharmacokinetics, safety
      and tolerability before initiating dose escalation in combination. An oral formulation of
      AZD0156 will be used.

      Module 1 explores AZD0156 in combination with olaparib Module 2 explores AZD0156 in
      combination with irinotecan/FOLFIRI Additional modules may be added to explore AZD0156 as a
      monotherapy or in combination with other agents and may be in different tumour types.

      Expansion cohorts may enroll additional patients to explore further the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and biological activity at selected dose(s) or alternate dosing schedules,
      and to get a preliminary assessment of efficacy .

      Module 1 includes an expansion cohort in locally advanced/metastatic tumours including but
      not limited to gastric adenocarcinoma Module 2 includes an expansion cohort in colorectal
      cancer
