  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric presentations are common in the emergency department (ED), and determining
      whether or not a psychiatric presentation is due to medical illness can be a difficult task
      for the emergency physician. The investigators define &quot;serious medical illness&quot; (SMI) as a
      pathological condition that would necessitate inpatient treatment on a medical or surgical
      ward. It is important for patient safety that SMI be triaged by the emergency physician to
      the appropriate inpatient service. The rate of missed SMI in patients with psychiatric
      presentations to the ED is unknown. The investigators will research missed SMI in patients
      referred to adult psychiatry from the ED, with the intent to improve patient safety.
