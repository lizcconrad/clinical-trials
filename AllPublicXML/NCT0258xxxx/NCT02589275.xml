  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, extension trial designed to evaluate the long term safety and
      efficacy over 3 months of TNX-102 SL tablets taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of
      Fibromyalgia (FM). Patients recruits into this trial are those who have successfully
      completed the double-blind studies; TNX-CY-F301 and TNX-CY-F302. Anticipated start for
      TNX-CY-F302 is for March 2016.

      Patients will not be made aware of the therapy they received during the double-blind study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consist of 4 study visits, including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which is
      anticipated to be the same date as Visit 6 in F301 or F302) and visits after 1, 2 and 3
      months of treatment (Visits 2-4).

      Primary:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of TNX-102 SL tablets taken
      daily at bedtime over an additional 3 months in patients with FM who have completed the
      double-blinded lead-in study

      Secondary:

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL tablets taken daily at
      bedtime to control symptoms of FM
