  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of a negative pressure dressing
      intraoperatively (Prevena; KCI, Inc) to vascular groin incisions decreases the wound
      complication rate in high risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study randomizes patients (1:1) considered high risk, according to a specific set of risk
      factors, for wound complications into standard post-op dressings vs. Prevena vacuum dressing.
      The wounds will then be assessed for wound complications in the 30 days postoperatively.
      Wound complications include breakdown, infection and lymph leak. Patients not considered high
      risk will have standard post-op dressings and followed similarly to controls. The
      investigators will also assess economic impact of negative pressure dressing on length of
      stay and overall inpatient costs.
