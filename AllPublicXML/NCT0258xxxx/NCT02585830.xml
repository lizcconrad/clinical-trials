  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the relationship between sleep timing and insulin resistance in
      adolescents with obesity. The investigators also aim to develop a physiologically-based
      mathematical model of adolescent sleep/wake and circadian interactions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dim light melatonin onset and offset</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva (~2mL) will be collected in 30 or 60 minute intervals in dim light (&lt;10 lux in the room; ~1.9 lux in the angle of gaze, confirmed by light meter) using polystyrene tubes throughout the night. Individualized melatonin sampling schedules will be determined to optimize calculation of DLMOn and DLMOff times by introducing 30 minute sampling at the times at which DLM On and DLM Off are predicted to occur based on actigraphy-reported sleep, wake, and midsleep times.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>During the screening visit, a 3-hour frequently sampled OGTT will be performed in the outpatient CTRC and interpreted by our collaborator Dr. Melanie Cree Green. The OGTT will take place in the AM, after a fast of at least 10 hours. Glucose and insulin samples will be collected every 30 minutes. The 3-hour time period has been selected, as adolescents have greater IR than adults.</description>
