  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is an essential first-line treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis
      (OA). However, only 13% of patients meet the activity recommendation of 150 minutes or more
      per week. The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of a
      Fitbit Flex (a wireless physical activity tracking device) paired with a new application,
      plus a brief education session and telephone counselling by a physiotherapist (PT), to
      improve physical activity and reduce sedentary time in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current practice guidelines emphasize the use of exercise and weight reduction as the
      first-line management of knee osteoarthritis (OA; affecting 1 in 10 Canadians). However, up
      to 90% of people with OA are inactive. Several modifiable risk factors are associated with
      low physical activity participation, including lack of motivation, doubts about the
      effectiveness of prescribed exercises and lack of health professional advice regarding ways
      to progress their physical activity. The variety of risk factors highlights the need for a
      multifaceted approach that provides support in terms of knowledge, skill development and
      timely advice from health professionals, as well as motivational support to stay active.

      Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of a Fitbit/Fitviz intervention, involving
      the use of a Fitbit Flex paired with a FitViz application (app), a brief education session,
      and telephone counselling by a physiotherapist, to improve physical activity participation
      and reduce sedentary time in people with knee OA. Our secondary objective is to assess the
      effect of the intervention on patients' OA disease status and self-efficacy in disease
      management. We will carry out three aims: 1) To develop the FitViz app to pair with Fitbit to
      enhance user experience; 2) To conduct a pilot test for the Fitbit/FitViz intervention; 3) To
      evaluate the effect of the Fitbit/FitViz intervention in patients with knee OA. In this
      proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators hypothesize that
      compared to a control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention Group), participants in the
      Immediate Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as
      determined by an objective measure, 2) reduce sedentary time during waking hours, 3) improve
      in OA disease status, and 4) improve in their self-efficacy of OA management.

      The investigators will use a mixed-method approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.
      The proof-of-concept study will employ a stepped wedge RCT design, whereby the intervention
      will be sequentially rolled out to participants over a number of time periods. The order in
      which individuals receive the intervention will be determined at random. The strength of this
      design is that it can properly address the efficacy question, while avoiding the dilemma of
      withholding the intervention to some participants, as in a parallel group design.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in time spent in MVPA at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear a SenseWear Mini accelerometer for 7 days at baseline, and at the end of Months 3, 6, and 9. We will calculate the average daily MVPA accumulated in bouts per day. A bout is defined as greater than or equal to 10 consecutive minutes at the level of 3 or higher METs, with allowance for interruption of up to 2 minutes below the threshold.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in characteristics of health behavior at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRHI is as 12-item scale, rated on a 7-point Likert scale, that measures characteristics of habitual behavior. We will ask participants to rate their strength of habit for three specific activity-related behaviors: sitting during leisure time at home, sitting during usual occupational activities, and walking outside for more than 10 minutes. A higher score indicates a stronger habit or behavior that is done frequently, automatically, and done without thinking about it.</description>

    <description>Education session, Fitbit/FitViz, PT counselling: Participants receive this intervention in Months 1-3. The session will include a presentation on physical activity, an individual goal-setting session with a registered physiotherapist, and an orientation to the Fitbit Flex and the FitViz app. In Months 1 and 2, participants will use the Fitbit/FitViz. The PT will review the progress with participants via 20-minute bi-weekly phone calls, and progressively modify their activities. In Month 3, participants will continue using the Fitbit/FitViz and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no bi-weekly phone calls. In Months 4-9, participants may continue using the Fitbit/FitViz without access to a PT.</description>
