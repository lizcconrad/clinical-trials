      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18 years of age and older.

          -  Subjects have a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (including lacunar stroke)
             supported by computed topography or magnetic resonance imaging.

          -  Subjects have stroke symptoms onset within 4.5 to 12 hours before initiation of study
             drug administration. For subjects with a wake-up stroke, symptoms onset time refers to
             the last time the subject was known to be well.

          -  Subjects have a NIHSS score of ≥ 2.

          -  Subjects, (or their legally authorized representative-where applicable and based on
             country-specific practice), must give written informed consent to participate in the
             study prior to participating in any study-related procedures. A separate written
             informed consent is required for collecting a blood sample for genotyping.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Subjects have been treated or are anticipated to be treated with tissue plasminogen
        activator and/or endovascular thrombectomy during current stroke.

        Eligible subjects declining these treatments can be enrolled to this study.

          -  Subjects have evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast computed tomography
             (CT) (or magnetic resonance [MR]).

          -  Subjects have symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even with normal CT.

          -  Subjects have an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) &lt; 6.

          -  Subjects have prior non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (excluding microhemorrahages
             observed in imaging).

          -  Subjects have known arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm.

          -  Subjects have evidence of active bleeding.

          -  Subjects have platelet count &lt; 100,000.

          -  Subjects have International Normalized Ratio &gt; 1.7.

          -  Subjects have used unfractionated heparin within 24 hours prior to treatment and have
             an elevated partial thromboplastin time.

          -  Subjects have used a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant such as dabigatran,
             rivaroxaban, apixaban, or other factor Xa inhibitors within 24 hours prior to
             treatment.

          -  Subjects have used fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin at an anticoagulation
             dose within 24 hours prior to treatment.

          -  Subjects with anticipated use of an anticoagulation dose of heparin, or fondaparinux
             or low molecular weight heparin, or nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant such as
             dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or other factor Xa inhibitors within 48 hours of
             randomization. Low dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin at a preventive dose
             are allowed from 24 hours after treatment start and after confirmation of no
             intracranial bleeding on the 24-hours repeat brain imaging.

          -  Subjects have blood pressure &gt; 185/110 mmHg, or require aggressive medication to
             maintain blood pressure below this limit (routine medical treatment is allowed to
             lower the blood pressure below this limit).

          -  Subjects have had intracranial surgery, clinically significant head trauma (in the
             opinion of Principal Investigator), Alteplase treatment, or a previous stroke within 1
             month.

          -  Subjects have had major surgery within 14 days.

          -  Subjects have had gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding in the last 21 days.

          -  Subjects have had a lumbar puncture (or epidural steroid injection) within 14 days.

          -  Subjects have a preexisting disability classified by mRS &gt; 2.

          -  Subjects have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (using Modification of Diet in
             Renal Disease equation) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Subjects have baseline hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dL.

          -  Subjects have a positive pregnancy test. Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be
             performed (according to site-specific practice) in women of childbearing potential
             (childbearing potential is assumed in women up to 55 years of age).

          -  Subject is currently participating in another investigational study or has
             participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days or 5 half-lives of that
             investigational drug prior to administration of the study drug.

          -  Subject is an employee or an immediate family member of an employee of the Sponsor,
             the CRO ((INC Research), or the Site.

          -  Any other reason, in the opinion of the Investigator, which precludes subject
             participation in the study.
