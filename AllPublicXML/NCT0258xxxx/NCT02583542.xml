  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 are two new anti-cancer treatments that AstraZeneca are
      developing; they are both not yet approved for clinical use.

      Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a drug that acts by blocking a protein called MEK, which has been
      linked to the development and growth of multiple cancers. AZD2014 is a drug that blocks a
      protein called mTOR that is involved in the growth and spread of cancer. Blocking the action
      of either MEK or mTOR alone may slow down or stop the cancer growing. Combining both drugs
      may make the cancer more sensitive than if Selumetinib (AZD6244) or AZD2014 are used alone
      and therefore this dual treatment may lead to increased anti-tumour effects.

      Although Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 given alone and in combination with other
      anti-cancer drugs have been tested in people with advanced cancer, the specific combination
      of Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 has not been used in people before. Therefore Phase 1b
      (Dose Escalation Phase) will determine what the recommended dose to use in Phase IIa (Dose
      Expansion Phase) will be. Efficacy, progression free survival, duration of response, and
      overall survival, will then be assessed in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and
      Non small cell lung cancer within Phase IIa.

    <description>This phase will investigate two different dosing schedules of AZD2014: a continuous daily schedule (CC-Schedule) and an intermittent schedule of 2 days on and 5 days off treatment (IC-Schedule). The dose of Selumetinib (AZD6244) will remain unchanged in both schedules. The outcome of this investigation will determine whether an additional schedule of combined intermittent Selumetinib (AZD6244) (3 days on and 4 days off treatment) with intermittent AZD2014 will be considered (II-Schedule). The II-Schedule will be initiated following the completion of the corresponding continuous regimens and will only be investigated if escalation of the AZD2014 dose in the IC-Schedule is not feasible with the corresponding continuous Selumetinib (AZD6244) regimen. Up to three individual dose levels of Selumetinib (AZD6244) might subsequently be explored within the intermittent schedule of Selumetinib (AZD6244).</description>

    <description>AZD2014 is a dual inhibitor of both mTORC1 (rapamycin-sensitive) and mTORC2 (rapamycin insensitive); compared to rapalogues, AZD2014 has a broader range of growth inhibitory activity in preclinical models based on a more profound mTORC1 inhibition and the additional inhibition of mTORC2. AZD2014 is currently in phase 2 studies in renal cell cancers and metastatic breast cancer.</description>
