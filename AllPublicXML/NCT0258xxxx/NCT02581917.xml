    <textblock>
      This research trial studies metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of blood from patients with acute myeloid leukemia in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the metabolic adaptations that occur following exposure to standard
      chemotherapeutic agents using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for analysis
      via cell isolation, glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption assays, viability assays, and
      western blot at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting chemotherapy.
