    <textblock>
      Morbidly obese patients exhibit impaired secretion of satiation hormones which may contribute
      to the development of obesity. Bariatric surgery is associated with weight loss and dramatic
      increase in the secretion of satiation hormones, but the underlying mechanism remains
      unknown. The investigator's goal is therefore to examine patients before and after sleeve
      gastrectomy and compare findings to lean controls.

      Morbidly obese patients exhibit impaired secretion of satiation hormones cholecystokinin
      (CCK), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which may contribute to the
      development of obesity. Bariatric surgery is associated with weight loss and dramatic
      increase in the secretion of satiation hormones, but the underlying mechanism remains
      unknown. A better understanding of mechanisms involved will assist in development of
      non-invasive therapeutic strategies. The investigator's goal is therefore to examine patients
      before and after sleeve gastrectomy and compare findings to lean controls. Gastric and
      intestinal mucosa will be collected by endoscopy from morbidly obese subjects before and 3
      months after sleeve gastrectomy. In Addition, lean controls will be examined. Expression of
      various gut peptides will be assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR).
