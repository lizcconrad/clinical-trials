  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The amount of activity completed by individuals within rehabilitation programs, even when
      units are well staffed, is often far below that required for optimal stroke rehabilitation,
      and is not individually adapted on a day-to-day basis. Daily feedback on their activity
      levels may motivate stroke survivors to engage in greater skills practice and thus outcome
      after stroke. To date only a few trials suggests that augmented feedback may be effective.
      There is a need for a large pragmatic trial to explore the impact of augmented activity
      feedback on top of their standard care. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect
      of augmented activity feedback by smart watches to support in-patient stroke rehabilitation.

      This study had a feasibility and pilot development phase from September 2015 to April 2016,
      and then moved into the main study with some changes in design and execution occurring in the
      light of experience. Its execution has also been constrained by external factors beyond
      control.

      It is in essence asking whether wearing a Smart Watch which gives feedback on activity every
      two hours, with a specific target tailored to the patient's performance 24 hours earlier will
      be associated with a higher rate of physical activity than seen in people wearing the same
      watch without and feedback been given.

      The intervention only lasts unto 21 days, but earlier discharge will terminate that patient's
      participation sooner. A telephone interview at 12 weeks after entry collect data on mobility.

      Outcome measures will assess mobility, activity, and health status.

    <measure>Activity goal attainment as measured and provided by the smart watch</measure>
    <time_frame>At three weeks, or discharge if sooner</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in feedback group receive a preset activity goal based on their previous activity levels at baseline. The smart watch will then provide graduated encouragement by increasing their activity goal by about 5%. Every 10-15 minutes the screen lights up and participants can see their activity progress expressed by activity bars (representing 0-100%). Participants reaching their activity goal is used to measure goal attainment.</description>
