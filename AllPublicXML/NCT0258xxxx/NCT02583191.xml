    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show feasibility (efficacy and safety) of Rivaroxaban in the
      treatment of VTE in cancer patients in comparison to the standard treatment with low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

      Tumor patients with active cancer and newly diagnosed thromboembolic events are randomised to
      receive either Rivaroxaban or the standard treatment with low-molecular heparin.
