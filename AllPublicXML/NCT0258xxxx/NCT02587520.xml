  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose and formulation ranging study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of
      SP0173 in healthy adolescents, adults, and older adults in the US.

      Primary Objective

        -  To describe the safety profile of each SP0173 investigational formulation.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of each SP0173 investigational formulation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a single dose of vaccine, and will be assessed for immunogenicity
      at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 30 days post-vaccination. They will also be monitored
      for safety from day of vaccination up to Day 180 post-vaccination.
