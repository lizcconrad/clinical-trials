      The data obtained in this project will identify the level of compliance to the
      pharmacological treatment of patients with hemophilia prophylaxis. They will use different
      psychosocial questionnaires based on scientific evidence and the reliability of these, as
      well as its specific design for patients with hemophilia. Clinical data were also obtained
      regarding the joint of patients participating in the study state.
