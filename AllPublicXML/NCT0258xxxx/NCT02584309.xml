  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at whether giving a drug called dexrazoxane
      plus olaratumab with standard of care doxorubicin affects the progression of the disease.
      Dexrazoxane is often given at the same time as doxorubicin to help reduce the incidence and
      severity of disease of the heart muscle (which can be caused by doxorubicin).

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
If no event exists, the PFS will be censored at the last scheduled disease assessment on study.
Progressive disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Dexrazoxane will be given intravenously on an outpatie2. -nt basis over 15 minutes on each day that doxorubicin is given.
Dexrazoxane should be given no more than 30 minutes prior to administration of doxorubicin, which is typically given on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
Dosing is a 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin; doxorubicin is typically given at 75 mg/m2, so dexrazoxane dosing would be 750 mg/m2.
Olaratumab is typically given on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycle at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Both doxorubicin and olaratumab are being given as routine care; their administration is not dictated per protocol.
In the event of a national shortage of dexrazoxane, 72-hour infusional doxorubicin can be used instead of dexrazoxane and bolus doxorubicin..</description>
