      Prospective study to obtain fresh tumor biopsies and three blood samples from patients with a
      confirmed histological or cytological diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors
      (NETs) or well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) for molecular
      profiling.

      In this prospective study the aim is to obtain fresh tumor biopsies and three blood samples
      from patients with a confirmed histological or cytological diagnosis of well-differentiated
      neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) or well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
      (PanNETs). Eligible population includes: NETs and PanNETs patients who have undergone or are
      undergoing treatment with targeted therapies and have shown prolonged clinical benefit, and
      NETs and PanNETs patients who have been treated with these agents and just recently
      progressed. RNA and DNA from fresh tumor biopsies and from mononuclear blood cells will be
      subjected to transcriptome sequencing and DNA sequencing analyses to evaluate possible genes
      of interest and related targetable pathways. Moreover, archived tumor samples will be
      requested from all patients to perform additional genomic testing. Remaining RNA and DNA will
      be banked for additional exploratory analyses (e.g. further genomic testing, or DNA copy
      number analysis, or epigenetic evaluations).
