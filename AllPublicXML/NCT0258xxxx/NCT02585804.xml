  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) constitute an increasing proportion
      of the total glomerulonephritis (GN) patient cohort in North America while FSGS is a risk
      factor for end stage renal failure. Current non-immunological FSGS therapies include the use
      of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB),
      to reduce intraglomerular hypertension. Unfortunately, these agents lead to incomplete renal
      protection. The aim of the current study is to determine whether the addition of novel sodium
      glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) to standard of care leads to reduced
      intraglomerular pressure and suppression of proteinuria. We hypothesize that combination
      therapy of SGLT2i drugs and conventional RAASi results in additive renal protective effects
      in FSGS patients. A further goal is to examine mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition by measuring
      renal hemodynamic function and sodium handling. Kidney function will be assessed in FSGS
      patients before and after an 8 week treatment with SGLT2i dapagliflozin.

    <textblock>
      FSGS and diabetic nephropathy may have common pathogenic mechanisms, that are mediated by
      intraglomerular hypertension, leading to hyperfiltration and proteinuria. Given that SGLT2i
      corrects early hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with diabetes, our aim is to determine
      if a similar benefit may extend to patients with FSGS. Based on previous experimental and
      clinical data, we hypothesize that SGLT2i will improve renal hemodynamic abnormalities
      characteristic of FSGS that promote renal injury and proteinuria.
