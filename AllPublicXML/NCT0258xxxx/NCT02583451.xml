  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 4-period crossover study
      of lemborexant in healthy adult and elderly subjects to evaluate driving performance
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases, Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase
      will consist of 2 periods that will last up to a maximum of 21 days: Screening and Baseline.
      The Randomization Phase will comprise of four, 9-day treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 -
      Treatment Period 4) with a minimum 14-day washout between treatment periods, and a follow-up
      interval of at least 14 days after Treatment Period 4 before the end-of-study (EOS) visit.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 sequences in an incomplete blocks design.

                  drug discontinuation. (NOTE: All females will be considered to be of childbearing
                  potential unless they are postmenopausal [amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive
                  months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause]
