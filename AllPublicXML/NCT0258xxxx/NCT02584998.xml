  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main study aim is to develop, implement and disseminate a pilot population-based mailed
      FIT outreach screening program in the Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on
      having an office visit, by conducting a proof-of-concept 3-arm parallel-design pragmatic
      randomized trial to (1) Compare the effects of usual care (UC), screening invitation +
      reminder (invitation-reminder), or screening invitation + mailed FIT kit + reminder
      (mailed-FIT); (2) Explore whether the FIT completion rate varies by age or race/ethnicity;
      and (3) Explore barriers to use of mailed outreach screening for Veterans.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the foundation to systematically study and improve the delivery
      and effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the VA by developing, implementing
      and disseminating a pilot mailed-FIT screening outreach program that does not rely on having
      a clinical office visit. The investigators specifically address the need to identify and
      remediate potential failures to identify and offer screening to eligible Veterans through
      multilevel interventions. The investigators will also create electronic data linkages to, in
      future studies, enable evaluation of FIT performance characteristics and help close critical
      evidence gaps for optimizing screening among Veterans. As this is a pilot study, the focus is
      to assess feasibility of a population-based screening outreach approach through the
      development, implementation and dissemination of a mailed FIT outreach program in the
      Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on having an office visit.

    <description>These patients will continue to receive the current practice at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (VAMC) of offering screening during an office visit. Other interventions will be embedded within this existing program for a pragmatic approach. However, all participants in the trial, including those in usual care (UC), will receive follow-up of test results and navigation to diagnostic colonoscopy for positive FIT results.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive UC and also receive an invitation letter with information about CRC testing. The information will include lay-audience description of screening tests and symptoms that should prompt diagnostic work-up. The packet will have instructions to contact the study team if participants believe they are not eligible and to update the contact information on record. The letter will inform participants that a telephone reminder will follow in 4 weeks from invitation letter if screening is not completed. They will also receive notification of test results and navigation to colonoscopy, if needed. For the purposes of this intervention, Week 1 will be the week the invitation letter was sent (time zero).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to Mailed-FIT will receive a mailed FIT pre-notification letter (plus a screening invitation) followed by the kit 1 week later. Participants will receive instructions to contact the study team if they believe they are not eligible and to update their contact information. They will be informed that a telephone reminder will follow 4 weeks from notification letter if screening is not completed. Participants who do not return their kit within 4 weeks after their pre-notification letter was mailed will receive a live telephone reminder, followed by 2 additional calls at the end of weeks 5 and 6, if needed. For the purposes of this intervention, Week 1 will be the week the pre-notification letter was sent (time zero).</description>

    <description>The FIT is analyzed at the Philadelphia VAMC by an auto-analyzer system that provides quantitative results corresponding to the concentration of hemoglobin in the collected sample. Specimens will be analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions to minimize potential degradation of hemoglobin. Results are provided as positive if the hemoglobin concentration is 100ng/dL. The machine records (but does not report) the quantitative results of the hemoglobin concentration in the sample, which we will seek to obtain from the laboratory for future studies.</description>
