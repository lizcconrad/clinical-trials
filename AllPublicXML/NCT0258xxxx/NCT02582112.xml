  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study was undertaken to evaluate
      whether warming IV fluids (37 oC) resulted in lower incidence of hypotension, less ephedrine
      and transfusion requirement and lower fluid consumption than use of room-temperature fluids
      (22 oC) in cesarean delivery patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia during cesarean delivery is not rare and frequently
      neglected, despite the recommendations by clinical guidelines. Exposure to cold air and
      infusing non-warmed intravenous (iv) fluids are the other main sources of inadvertent
      hypothermia. Spinal anesthesia used during the cesarean delivery has also been demonstrated
      to impair normal autonomic thermoregulatory control and extend inadvertent perioperative
      hypothermia. Various measures such as pre-warming of patients or fluids before anesthesia,
      peroperative warming of iv fluids and active/passive cutaneous warming techniques have all
      been used to prevent or to reduce inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. This prospective,
      double-blinded, randomized, controlled study was undertaken to evaluate whether warming IV
      fluids (37 oC) resulted in lower incidence of hypotension, less ephedrine and transfusion
      requirement and lower fluid consumption than use of room-temperature fluids (22 oC) in
      cesarean delivery patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.

      The hypothesis was that in elective caesarean delivery patients undergoing spinal anesthesia,
      warming intravenous fluids, would reduce the incidence of hypotension, ephedrine and
      transfusion requirement and volume consumption. Thus, the primary outcome measure of the
      present study was the incidence of intraoperative maternal hypotension and ephedrine
      requirement during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. Secondary outcome measures were
      total volume consumption, blood loss, pain scores, shivering and maternal and foetal side
      effects.
