      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of cesarean delivery in pregnancies
      complicated with isolated oligohydramnios managed by induction of labor. This prospective
      case-control study was conducted in Hamıdıye Sisli Etfal Teaching and Research Hospital
      between January 2013 and June 2014. 159 women with isolated oligohydramnios and 165 women
      with postdate pregnancies who met the inclusion criteria underwent induction of labor with
      dinoprostone or oxytocin. The rate and the indications of C/S deliveries were compared
      between two groups.

      The study was designed as a prospective study. The rates of cesarean section and
      maternal/fetal outcomes had been compared between pregnancies complicated with isolated
      oligohydramnios at term and postdate pregnancies. All patients with isolated oligohydramnios
      were term (37-40 weeks' gestation according to accurate last menstrual period and first
      trimester sonographic examination). Oligohydramnios was defined as an amniotic fluid index &lt;
      5 cm. The control group consisted of prolonged pregnancies in the absence of spontaneous
      labor and oligohydramnios. Prolonged pregnancy is diagnosed if 41 gestational weeks are
      completed according to accurate date of last menstrual period and first trimester ultrasound.
      All patients who accepted to join the study gave informed consent. All patients had a
      complete physical and obstetrical examination. Vital signs were recorded at regular
      intervals. The primary outcome measure was defined as cesarean section rates in pregnancies
      complicated with isolated oligohydramnios managed by induction of labor.
