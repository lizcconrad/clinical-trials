    <textblock>
      Subjects are asked to take part in a clinical research study that tests Eribulin, a new drug.
      Eribulin is an investigational (experimental) anti-cancer agent that has not been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with brain metastases. Eribulin is
      FDA approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer but the effect it may or may
      not have on brain metastases has not been studied.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the 3-month central nervous system (CNS)-progression free survival (PFS) for
      patients with metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases treated with eribulin mesylate.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      1. Estimate CNS complete and partial response rates (CR and PR) and duration of CNS response
      in this patient population.

      2 Evaluate toxicity in patients with breast cancer with brain metastases treated with
      eribulin mesylate.

      3 Estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 3 months in breast cancer patients with brain
      metastases treated with eribulin mesylate. (CBR is the sum of CR, PR and stable disease at 3
      months).

      4 To estimate systemic disease (extra cranial) response rate and duration of systemic
      response in this patient population.

      5 Overall survival in this patient population.

      Design:

      This is a phase II study that will require patients to evaluate the primary objective (CNS
      PFS at 3 months). Study patients will have a baseline brain MRI and a second MRI at 12 weeks
      to evaluate disease.
