    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of transanal decompression tube
      as a bridge to surgery with stent as a bridge to surgery for acute malignant left-sided
      colonic and rectal obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 8-47 % of patients with colorectal cancer will present with colonic
      obstruction. Left-sided colonic and rectal cancer is responsible for nearly 70% of acute
      colonic obstruction. Emergency colonic surgery for acute obstruction is associated with a
      higher mortality and morbidity rate than elective surgery. Preoperative decompression results
      in a less dilated bowel that is more amenable to an elective surgery. Both transanal
      decompression tube and stent can serve a good preoperative decompression effect and serve a
      good bridge to surgery. Investigators aim to compare the clinical outcomes of transanal
      decompression tube as a bridge to surgery with stent as a bridge to surgery for acute
      malignant left-sided colonic and rectal obstruction.
