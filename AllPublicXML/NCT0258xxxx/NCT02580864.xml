    <textblock>
      This trial will be exploratory, open in vitro study on human tissues. 120 patients will be
      enrolled (Caucasian, male/female,18-65 years old) with moderate-severe active Crohns disease
      and with indication for anti-TNF therapy according to the normal clinical practice.

      Simultaneously, 30 no-IBD controls with no GI disorders, as defined by medical history and
      standard clinical chemistry values, afferent to the out-patient clinic will be enrolled.
