  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, disabling, progressive condition characterised by
      severe problems with movement for which medical treatment in the longer term can be
      unsatisfactory. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment, which directly stimulates the
      nerve cells affected inside the brain to help overcome the difficulties with movement.
      Classically, DBS stimulates in a manner that is constant and independent of a patients
      underlying condition as reflected in their brainwave activity. Recent research has suggested
      that adjusting DBS in real time using analyses of brain signals recorded from DBS electrodes
      (termed closed loop DBS) nay be better than classical DBS in alleviating difficulties with
      movement. However, it remains unclear whether closed-loop DBS also leads to fewer unwanted
      side effects on movement control.In order to answer this question, the investigators will
      analyze DBS activity and activity recorded from the surface of the head in PD patients
      undergoing DBS surgery. During the recordings patients will perform different movement tasks.
      DBS has been found to reduce patients' ability to suppress inappropriate movements in certain
      tasks and performance in these tasks will be the core point of interest. The recordings will
      be conducted three times: During closed loop DBS, classical DBS and while the stimulator is
      turned off. This will allow the investigators to assess putative differences in the effect of
      closed loop and classical DBS with regards to wanted and unwanted effects on movement control
      and to elucidate their correlates in the brain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participants will be PD patients undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus
             (STN).

               -  Whether or not a patient is selected for DBS surgery is determined by the
                  patient's clinical team purely on independent clinical grounds.

               -  Only those patients who have been accepted for DBS treatment by their clinical
                  neurologist and functional neurosurgeon will be introduced to the project and
                  have their details passed on to the research team for further information and
                  formal consenting.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lack of capacity to consent (judged by the clinician taking consent as not having
             sufficient mental capacity to understand the study and its requirements). This is
             including anyone who, in the opinion of the clinician taking consent, is unlikely to
             retain sufficient mental capacity for the duration of their involvement in the study.

          -  Cognitive impairment/lack of capacity to perform experimental task. We will
             additionally conduct a short (10 min) quantitative assessment of cognitive function
             using a validated test (MMSE). Patients with a score &lt; 20 will be excluded from the
             study.
