    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if sampling technique of urine affects diagnostic
      modalities in primary care. Furthermore it aims to determine if there is difference in the
      accuracy of the point-of-care test, when the urine sample is stored at room-temperature and
      analyzed later in the day.

    <textblock>
      125 patients with one or more symptoms of urinary tract infections, contacting their GP, are
      asked to make 2 urine samples from the same void. The patient is asked to void firstly in one
      cup, approximately 10-20 ml., then stop voiding. Then the patient is asked to void the rest
      into a second cup. This way there is collected both a first-void and a midstream-void from
      the same patient and the same void.

      All the samples are analyzes using urine-dipstick, microscopy and point of care test urine
      culture. The urine of the midstream void is sent to a Microbiology lab for analyzes as well.
      Furthermore the test are analyzes again after 1 and 4 hours.
