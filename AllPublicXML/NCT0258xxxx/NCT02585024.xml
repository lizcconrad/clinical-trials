  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of pharmacotherapies are available for smoking cessation in New Zealand including
      nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, an antidepressant medication and varenicline. Of
      these, varenicline is the most effective, but also the most expensive. Varenicline acts like
      nicotine and stimulates nicotine receptors in the brain, but to a lesser extent, and
      simultaneously block nicotine binding to its receptors and thus reduces the rewarding effects
      of cigarette smoking. Cytisine (Tabex速 and Desmoxan速) is a plant alkaloid and also acts in a
      similar way to varenicline but is significantly cheaper. It has been used for more than 50
      years in some parts of eastern and central Europe as an aid to quit smoking, but is not
      approved for use in many countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the UK or the US.
      Randomised, placebo-controlled trials have shown that cytisine is more effective than placebo
      and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)for smoking cessation. However there is a paucity of
      pre-clinical data on cytisine. In particular, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetic
      and the dose response characteristics of cytisine. Furthermore, the current dosing regimen
      recommended by the manufacturer is complex and has no clear basis in empirical research.

      Complexity of dosing has been shown to be a key factor in determining adherence. Therefore, a
      simpler regimen would likely maximise the effectiveness of treatment through improved
      adherence to the treatment regimen. The investigators therefore propose to undertake two
      studies to investigate the influence of dose, dosing frequency and dosing duration on the
      pharmacokinetics and tolerability of cytisine and cigarette craving in smokers.
