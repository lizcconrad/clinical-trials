  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Day surgery is performed in the same way as in full hospital admission, allowing same-day
      discharge without increased risk. It provides many grounds for patient satisfaction. Progress
      in surgical and anesthesia techniques now allows this form of management to be developed and
      prioritized.

      Day-care surgery for prolapse has been little studied. The present study is intended to help
      extend its future implementation, the primary objective being to assess the feasibility of
      the day-care approach in prolapse surgery. The secondary objectives are to study criteria of
      non-eligibility for day-care prolapse surgery, reasons for patients' refusal, causes of
      failure, predictive factors for failure, patient satisfaction, postoperative complications,
      2-year anatomic and functional results, pain, quality of life and sexuality, and
      postoperative onset of dyspareunia and urinary incontinence.

      The design is for a prospective non-randomized study conducted in 3 gynecologic surgery sites
      managed by the Lyon hospitals board (Hospices Civils de Lyon).
