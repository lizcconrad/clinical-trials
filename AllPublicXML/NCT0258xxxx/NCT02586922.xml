      The aim of this study is to determine cut-off values for fetal lung volume by VOCAL and
      pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler in fetuses of diabetic mothers, and
      correlate the results with postnatal respiratory distress of the term neonates.

      Research question:

      Can the assessment of fetal lung volume by Virtual Organ Computed-aided Analysis (VOCAL) and
      pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler predict neonatal respiratory distress
      syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic mothers?

      Research hypothesis:

      The assessment of fetal lung volume by VOCAL and pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed
      Doppler can predict neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic
      mothers.
