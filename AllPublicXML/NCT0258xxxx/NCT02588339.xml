  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test PANO in combination with tacrolimus/sirolimus (TAC/SIR) for acute GVHD
      prevention. The purpose of this study is to determine if Panobinostat (PANO) when used in
      combination with sirolimus and tacrolimus will help reduce the incidence of Graft-vs-host
      disease (GVHD).

    <measure>Cumulative Incidence of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive at least one dose of the study drug (PANO) per protocol will be eligible for primary and secondary endpoints. Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV by day 100. Investigators will consider ≥43% incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD not acceptable. Investigators will use 23% incidence rate of GVHD as target. GVHD severity stage and grading and distribution will be measured weekly from day of transplant to day 90 +/- 14 using standard scoring system. Stage of GVHD will be given for each site of involvement (e.g. skin, liver, and gut), as well as a composite score for overall acute GVHD grade. Pathologic confirmation of aGVHD will be dictated by usual clinical practice, and not mandated by this protocol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Incidence of Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>GVHD with onset after 100 days post-HCT with presence of at least one diagnostic manifestation of chronic c-GVHD or distinct manifestation confirmed by biopsy or other relevant tests (e.g., PFT). Classified as: 1- Classic chronic GVHD - meets criteria for chronic GVHD and has no features consistent with aGVHD or 2-Overlap syndrome - features of acute and chronic GVHD exist together. C-GVHD will be measured prospectively in all participants on days 90+/-14 , 120 +/- 14, 150 +/- 14, 180+/- 14, 270+/- 30, and 365 +/- 30 as per standardized scoring system.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stable Engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Stable engraftment for white blood count (WBC) is defined as a sustained absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500 over 3 days without cytokine support. Stable platelet engraftments is defined as count of &gt; 20,000 over 7 days without transfusion support. Time to engraftment is defined as time from day 0 to day of sustained engraftment per above criteria for both platelets and WBC.</description>

    <measure>Non-relapse Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of primary disease relapse and non-relapse related death will be reported per standard definitions. These will be treated as competing risk events. Non-relapse death is defined as death in continuous remission from primary disease requiring transplantation.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
