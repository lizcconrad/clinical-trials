    <textblock>
      This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung
      cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for
      subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*205 and/or HLA-A*0206 protein
      and a tumor test positive for NY-ESO-1 expression (protein or gene). The study will take the
      subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a
      laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T
      cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer
      cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in
      subjects with lung cancer.

      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells
      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the
      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years
      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the
      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the
      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,
      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.

      This is a single-arm study of genetically engineered NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells in HLA-A*0201,
      HLA-A*0205 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC.
      Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance status and
      disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo a
      large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ TCR
      bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will receive
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on Day -7, Day -6 and Day
      -5 followed by the cell infusion on Day 1.

      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 1) through Day 5, Days 8, 10, 12, and then weekly until week 6 and then at 8, 10, 12,
      16, 20 and 24 weeks, and every 3 months until 2 years and then every 6 months until
      progression of their disease (or withdrawal of consent for the interventional portion of the
      study)

      Subjects who have a confirmed response (or have stable disease for &gt;4 months) but subsequent
      disease progression following the initial infusion and whose tumor continues to express the
      appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion.

      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will
      enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All
      subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up
      phase.

                  with protocol requirements.

               -  Clinically significant psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
                  compliance with study requirements.

                  HCV antibody positive will be screened for HCV RNA by any RT polymerase chain
                  reaction (PCR) or bDNA assay. If HCV antibody is positive, eligibility will be
                  determined based on a negative screening RNA value.

               -  Positive serology for HTLV 1 or 2.

        Furthermore and prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy, a subject meeting the following

             chemotherapy; immune therapy (including monoclonal antibody therapy, checkpoint
             inhibitors or biological therapy within 4 weeks prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy;

             lymphodepleting chemotherapy; tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. erlotinib,
             gefitinib) within 1 week prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

          2. Radiotherapy that involves the lung or mediastinum within 3 months prior to
             chemotherapy. (Note: there is no washout period for palliative radiation to non-target
             organs other than the lung or mediastinum. If radiation was to an intended target
             lesion within 3 months of baseline imaging studies, and the lesion is progressing
             within this time frame it may be considered as a target lesion after review and
             discussion with the Sponsor.)
