  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to develop, and test the feasibility and efficacy of, a manual based,
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) treatment for Hoarding Disorder (HD) delivered in a group
      format combined with an Internet support system. The investigators' secondary aim is to
      investigate the neurocognitive profile of the participants before and after treatment in
      order to explore if the treatment might have an impact on neurocognitive functioning and if
      certain neurocognitive profiles predict outcome.

      For the primary aim, the investigators hypothesize that the treatment will be acceptable to
      participants and decrease symptoms of hoarding. Regarding the secondary aim, the
      investigators hypothesize that deficiencies in executive functioning, as measured with a
      neurocognitive battery, will reduce upon completion of treatment and that baseline executive
      function will be associated with treatment outcome.

    <measure>Saving Cognitions Inventory (SCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to treatment week 8,16, 3- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is a 24-item self-report questionnaire assessing beliefs and attitudes participants experience when trying to discard items. It is divided in 4 subscales:emotional attachment to objects, beliefs about objects as memory aids, responsibility for not wasting possessions, and the need for control over possessions.</description>

    <description>In this questionnaire, study participants register their monthly health care consumption (e.g. GP visits) as well as time spent in informal health enhancing activities (e.g. self-help groups and informal care from friends). Additionally, work loss and work cutback both at work and in the domestic realm is measured.</description>
