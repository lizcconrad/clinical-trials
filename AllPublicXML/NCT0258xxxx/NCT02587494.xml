  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will lead to a large randomized control trial (RCT), to assess
      whether early versus late or no cardiac catheterization is associated with improved outcomes
      in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients.

      A pilot multicenter RCT.

      The objectives of the study are:

      To assess whether early (within 12 hours) cardiac catheterization is associated with improved
      survival, neurologic and cardiovascular outcomes in OHCA patients.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to early cardiac catheterization, performed as early as
      possible, within 12h post return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following OHCA, or to
      standard practice, which may include medical management without cardiac catheterization or
      late cardiac catheterization after completion of therapeutic hypothermia. Percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended for culprit lesions found on diagnostic
      angiography. All patients will undergo therapeutic hypothermia started as soon as possible
      with target temperature below 36°C according to local practice. Other medical management will
      be according to standard of care
