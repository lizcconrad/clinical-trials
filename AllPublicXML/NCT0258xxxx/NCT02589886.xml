      A randomised trial to the effect of a newly developed education and self help intervention
      for patients with a functional motor disorder on general health, quality of life, illness
      perception, symptom severity and other secondary outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be referred to the study from all neurology centers in the Netherlands that are
      found willing to participate. After informed consent is acquired, patients will be randomised
      into one of these two groups: usual care only or the education and self help intervention
      added to usual care. At baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months patients will fill out
      questionnaires at home online or on paper.

      Patients will not be blinded for the intervention. The researcher is blinded during analysis
      of the data. During the study contact between the researcher and the participants will be
      restricted to research related topics. All contact between participants and the researcher
      will be documented.

      To increase generalisability and applicability in clinical practice after the trial the
      investigators have chosen to add the intervention to usual care and to keep exclusion
      criteria to a minimum.

      Our education and self help internet intervention is an especially designed website with an
      educational approach. The content of the intervention is written by a team of international
      experts and consists of education about the mechanism of functional motor disorders and it's
      treatment and of self help advice and exercises. During the trial the website will only be
      accessible with a log-in. The education and self help internet intervention is
      self-explanatory and unguided.

      The medical ethical committee of the University Medical Center Groningen has taken our
      research under review and has decided this study does not fall under the scope of the Medical
      Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO-Wet Mensgebonden Onderzoek).
