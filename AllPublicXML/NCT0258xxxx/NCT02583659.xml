      This prospective cohort study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the first-line
      combined chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer(AGC) in Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>

      1. Establish a clinical database for the advanced gastric cancer patients treated with
           first-line combined chemotherapy in Tongji hospital.

           1.1.Data including age, gender, smoking state, karnofsky performance score（KPS）, disease
           history, clinical stage, primary tumor site, metastasis site, surgery, first-line
           chemotherapy, therapy after failure of first-line treatment, radiotherapy, toxicity,
           survival time, the time of free of progress, response were collected.

           1.2.The peripheral blood samples were collected for further biomarker reserch.

        2. Kaplan-Meier and Cox model will be used to analyze the overall survival(OS) and
           progression-free survival(PFS) of advanced gastric cancer.

        3. Extract Deoxyribonucleic acid（DNA） from the the peripheral blood and research biomarkers
           related to the first-line combined chemotherapy for AGC.
