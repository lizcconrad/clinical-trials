  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic therapy in reducing the incidence of
      antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) in
      pneumonia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients admitted to Good Samariatan Hospital and placed on the
      pneumonia order set. After obtaining consent, subjects will be randomized to the proboiotic
      or placebo group. Subjects will be followed for 21 days after starting the study treatment to
      determine critical outcomes such as incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C-Diff.
      Other outcomes include length of stay, healthcare costs, and death.
