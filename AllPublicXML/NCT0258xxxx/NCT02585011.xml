  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At St.Olavs Hospital each year about 400 patients are treated for femoral neck fractures, 250
      of them receiving hemiarthroplasty. Implementation of fast-track clinical pathways reduces
      morbidity and enhances recovery of patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty. One of the key
      prerequisites for early rehabilitation is optimized pain relief. Local infiltration
      anesthesia with Ropivacaine is part of a multimodal pain regimen for patients receiving
      hemiarthroplasty at St.Olavs Hospital, although the pain reducing effect of local Ropivacaine
      after hemiarthroplasty has not been investigated in clinical trials. In this study it will be
      investigated whether a single shot with Ropivacaine reduces acute postoperative pain and
      opioid requirement after hemiarthroplasty. The findings of this study will have a direct
      impact on patient treatment.
