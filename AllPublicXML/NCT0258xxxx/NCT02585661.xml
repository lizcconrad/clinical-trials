      compounds

    <textblock>
      This single center trial will be double-blind, controlled randomized with a crossover trial.
      One group (n=10) will start the study with the consumption of a Fe-54 salt fortified dairy
      product, while the other group will start the study with the consumption of Fe-57 salt
      fortified dairy product. The day after, in a cross over design, subjects will be administered
      the alternative test product. A blood sampling will be performed 14 days after the last
      stable isotope administration to allow the measurement of Fe stable isotope ratios and the
      calculation of Fe absorption. The duration of the trial will be 16 days in total.

      The total sample size is 20 enrolled subjects. Patients will be healthy females aged 18-40
      years old
