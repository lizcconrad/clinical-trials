    <textblock>
      Changes in mood and cognition are common in older adulthood. Some studies have suggested that
      transcranial application of near-infrared (NIR) light may have enhancing effects on cognitive
      and mood status in young adults and individuals with traumatic brain injury. This effect has
      not been examined in older adults. This study will involve a randomized sham-controlled trial
      to learn whether NIR stimulation improves cognition and mood in older adults, relative to
      sham treated controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a dearth of clinically meaningful treatment options at this point in time for
      individuals who are at increased risk for transitioning to dementia, particularly those with
      the amnestic variant of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). While waiting for causative cures
      and preventive approaches, investigators are faced with the task of identifying modifying
      therapies that might alter the course or slow down the transition from normal cognition to
      MCI to dementia.

      The proposed study hopes to contribute to this mission by testing the viability of a
      different type of intervention, one involving transcranial delivery of near-infrared (NIR)
      wavelengths (808-904nm). Near-infrared stimulation is safe, non-invasive and appears to
      improve mitochondrial function by promoting increased production of intracellular adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) and possibly improved blood flow. Perhaps most compelling are recent
      findings of reduced beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic Alzheimer's mouse
      models after exposure to real vs sham transcranial NIR stimulation. Preliminary human
      involving traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and young adult populations have also been
      promising in terms of positive effects of NIR on cognition.

      The overall goal of the present study is to learn whether this unconventional NIR stimulation
      approach has potential for improving cognition in older adults. To do so, investigators will
      conduct a randomized sham controlled pilot trial. The intervention will involve six sessions,
      over a 2-week period in which real or sham stimulation is transcranially applied using a
      delivery system that has been FDA-approved as a nonsignificant risk since 2003. Researchers
      hope to learn whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, has positive effects on cognition
      and mood in older adults.

    <description>Computer-based battery of executive functioning tests which yields a total or &quot;composite&quot; score to represent global executive functioning. Executive composite scores can range from -3.0 to 3.0, with higher scores corresponding to better executive functioning, and negative scores indicating impairment. A change score will be calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the post-test scores.</description>

    <description>The LASSI-L is a 15 item word list learning task that instructs a participant to remember a list of common words (fruits, musical instruments, or articles of clothing with 5 words per category) after interference and delay. The delayed recall score ranges from 0-15. A change score will be calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the post-test scores.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Near Infrared Stimulation for cognitively normal participants who will attend a total of 6 treatment sessions over a two week period. During each session, stimulation via light emitting diode clusters will occur for a total of 60 minutes. Four light emitting diode (LED) clusters will be applied in 3 distinct configurations. There will be 20 minutes of stimulation at each of these 3 configurations. Each configuration will target 4 sites, for a total of 12 sites over the course of the 60 minute session. The power density used will be 500 milliwatts (mW) with a cumulative fluence (energy density) of 312 Joules/cm2 (26 J/cm2 applied at 12 sites). It is estimated that approximately 6 Joules/cm2 will reach the cortex with each daily treatment.</description>
