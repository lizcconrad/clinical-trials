    <textblock>
      This study evaluates ADCT-301 in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1)
      and receive ADCT-301 either weekly or once every 3 weeks.

      In Part 2 of the study, patients will receive a recommended dose of ADCT-301 as determined by
      a Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study with ADCT-301 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ADCT-301 in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

      ADCT-301 is a human monoclonal antibody attached via a cleavable linker to a
      pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) warhead which, when internalized by antigen expressing cells,
      covalently cross links deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preventing replication.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will either be
      on weekly administration or every 3-week administration. Patients on weekly administration
      will receive an infusion of ADCT-301 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3 week treatment cycle.
      Patients on 3-week administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-301 on Day 1, every 3
      weeks. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      In Part 2 (expansion), patients will be assigned to receive a recommended dose and/or
      schedule of ADCT-301 as determined by a Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

      For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period, and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months
      after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall
      patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the
      entire study (Parts 1 and 2) will enroll a maximum of 80 patients and could last
      approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.
