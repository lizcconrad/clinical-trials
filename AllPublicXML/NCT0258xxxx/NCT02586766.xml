      intervention given during emergency department care to 14-20 year olds seeking treatment,
      could reduce youth violence.

      This Emergency Department (ED) based study will test the effectiveness of a tailored
      therapist delivered motivational interviewing intervention, and an informational pamphlet
      control condition (IC) on reducing violence in 14-20 year olds who present to the Hurley
      Medical Center (HMC). Eligible adolescents at the Hurley Medical Center (HMC) emergency
      department (ED) (based on eligibility criteria) will complete a computerized online survey.
      The goal of the intervention was to examine ways to reduce and prevention youth violence
      using techniques to change behavior in a respectful, non-confrontational, and non-judgmental
      manner. This one-on one counseling approach emphasizes individual choice and responsibility
      and differentiates between future goals/values and current behavior. At 2-months following
      their ED visit, eligible adolescents (both from the intervention group and control group)
      will meet with a research assistant and self-administer an online computerized follow-up
      survey. An online survey tool will be used for baseline, follow up and post-test surveys.
      Participants will self-administer the survey at the time of follow up, post-test and
      baseline.
