  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this phase II study of EGCG therapy protection of the skin from
      damage induced by radiotherapy in breast cancer. In order to observe the effectiveness of
      EGCG, investigators will utilize both clinician assessments and patient self-assessments.
      Physician's skin assessments will be scored utilizing the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
      (RTOG) score. Patient reported symptom scores are adapted from the Skin Toxicity Assessment
      Tool (STAT) as pain, burning, itching, pulling, and tenderness in the treatment area. The
      scales are translated into Chinese and guides in Chinese are developed instructing how to use
      the scales and perform the assessments.

    <description>EGCG (purity≥95% by high pressure liquid chromatography; from Ningbo HEP Biotech Co., Ltd) is dissolved in 0.9% saline solution;The solution is sprayed three times a day at 0.05 ml/cm2 to the whole radiation field until two weeks after radiation completion; Patients who developed grade Ⅱ radiation-induced dermatitis have the option to either withdraw from the study or to continue with EGCG. Patients are follow general good skin care practices during radiation therapy, such as not applying water soaks to relieve itching or pain, not vigorously rubbing the irradiated area, or not erasing ink marks; patting the skin dry with a soft towel; avoiding exposure to the sun; and wearing loose and cotton clothes. They are advised not to use deodorant, lotion, cream, make up, perfume or any other product on the area during the course of radiation therapy.</description>
