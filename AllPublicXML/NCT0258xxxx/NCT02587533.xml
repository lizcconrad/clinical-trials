  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral chemoreceptors and baroreceptors are located in close proximity in the carotid
      artery wall at the level of the carotid bifurcation. Baroreceptor stimulation lowers
      sympathetic activity and blood pressure. In contrast, chemoreceptor stimulation raises
      sympathetic activity and blood pressure. Thus, beneficial effects of electrical carotid sinus
      stimulation on blood pressure could be diminished by chemoreceptor overactivity and/or
      concomitant chemoreceptor activation through the device. Therefore, our study will assess
      baroreflex/chemoreflex interactions in patients with resistant hypertension equipped with
      carotid sinus stimulators. The study will inform us of potential additional anti-hypertensive
      benefits of simultaneous chemoreceptor denervation during electrode placement. Furthermore,
      the results may provide information about suitable electrode design to spare co-activation of
      peripheral chemoreceptors. Taken together, the study will help develop strategies for
      improving responder rate and efficacy of carotid sinus stimulators in patients with resistant
      hypertension.

      Patients with implanted devices for electrical baroreflex stimulation are recruited according
      to inclusion and exclusion criteria until good quality recordings have been obtained in 10
      out of maximally 15 patients. After obtaining written informed consent patients will be
      investigated in the laboratory on one day. In up to 20% of the patients we may fail to find
      an appropriate nerve recording position. In these cases we will ask the patient to repeat the
      experiment.

      Patients will be investigated in the post-absorptive state after emptying their bladder.
      During instrumentation and measurements they will rest in supine position. We will fix chest
      electrodes for ECG and impedance cardiography. A peripheral venous catheter will be
      introduced for later dopamine infusion. Cuffs will be used at the upper arm and the finger in
      order to monitor blood pressure and to allow for pulse-contour analysis. Finally, we will
      search for a suitable nerve recording position in the peroneal nerve for recordings of muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, postganglionic vasoconstrictor sympathetic drive). All
      bioelectric signals will be recorded continuously for the duration of the experiments.

      After the preparations baseline recordings will be performed. Subsequently, the electrical
      baroreflex stimulator is switched OFF and ON repeatedly (toggling) under normoxic conditions.
      Every OFF and ON state will last for 4 minutes. Oscillometric blood-pressure readings are
      taken every two minutes so as to acquire two readings per stimulation period. Toggling under
      normoxia is meant to ensure that the patient is a responder at the experimental day and to
      rule out that the blood pressure rises are too high off stimulation (safety concern).
      Afterwards, the breathing gas will be changed in order to have the patient inhale a hypoxic
      or hyperoxic mixture in a blinded manner. After reaching a stable ventilatory and autonomic
      state, stimulator toggling and blood-pressure measurements will be repeated. The same
      procedures will take place after establishing the opposite oxygenation state. Stimulation
      will be ON in between the oxygen states implying that the first switches will be OFF switches
      with all oxygenation conditions. Afterwards, the last oxygenation state will be maintained
      and additional low-dose dopamine infusion will be applied. Again, the electrical baroreflex
      stimulator will be switched off and on repeatedly and blood-pressure readings are taken.
      During the last two stimulator toggling states of each oxygenation level, venous blood
      samples are drawn for hormone measurements and inert gas rebreathing will take place for
      cardiac output determination. Finally, the correct positioning of the microneurography
      electrode is checked again.

      The duration of such an experiment depends on the time needed to find the sympathetic nerve
      bundles before the measurements and during the experiment, in case the recording position
      gets lost. However, experiments will rarely exceed 5 hours in total.

    <measure>Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 24 minutes of stable de/oxygenation +/- dopamine infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) will be determined as burst frequency, i. e. as the number of bursts per minute [bursts/min]. In responders, electrical carotid sinus stimulation will lead to a decline in MSNA: [-]MSNA. According to our primary hypothesis, [-]MSNA during hyperoxic conditions ([-]MSNA_hyperoxia) is larger than during hypoxia ([-]MSNA_hypoxia). Therefore, the primary endpoint of the study is the difference [-]MSNA_hyperoxia - [-]MSNA_hypoxia. The study is successful as soon as the difference between the reduction in the hyperoxic and the hypoxic condition is significantly different from zero. A positive value would confirm our primary hypothesis. In case of a negative difference, we would conclude that the potency of electrical baroreflex stimulation to lower sympathetic activity is larger under conditions of an activated chemoreflex.</description>

    <description>In responders, electrical carotid sinus stimulation will lead to a decline in systolic blood pressure: [-]SBP. According to our primary hypothesis, [-]SBP during hyperoxic conditions ([-]SBP_hyperoxia) is larger than during hypoxia ([-]SBP_hypoxia). Therefore, the secondary endpoint of the study is the difference [-]SBP_hyperoxia - [-]SBP_hypoxia. A positive value would confirm our secondary hypothesis. If the difference turns out to be negative, we would conclude that the potency of electrical baroreflex stimulation to lower blood pressure is larger under conditions of an activated chemoreflex. However, such a finding would not necessarily imply that chemoreceptor activation is a prerequisite for optimal baroreflex activation therapy because SBP *level* could be lower with *inactive* chemoreceptors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>End-tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure (etCO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 24 minutes of normoxia.</time_frame>
    <description>Electrical carotid sinus stimulation may lead to co-activation of carotid body chemoreceptors which would result in increased ventilation and etCO2 reduction. According to our hypothesis, etCO2 is higher without than with electrical baroreflex stimulation. Hence, the endpoint is the difference etCO2,OFF - etCO2,ON.
EtCO2 will be assessed during normoxia. Argument against hypoxia: The hypoxic challenge is expected to increase ventilation. The ensuing etCO2 drop would represent a confounder. Thus, we seek for normal etCO2 levels during hypoxia by adding variable tiny amounts of CO2 to the breathing gas. (Note: This is not an intervention but avoids an important confounder, namely etCO2 changes.) Argument against hyperoxia: Carotid body chemosensors may be desensitized to electrical stimulation during hyperoxia.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Implanted device for electrical baroreflex stimulation.

          -  The patient is a 'responder', i. e. carotid-sinus stimulation causes a drop in
             systolic arterial pressure by at least 15 mmHg.

          -  The patient gave informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is an investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant,
             pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in
             the conduct of the protocol.

          -  The mental condition renders the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study.

          -  The patient is unlikely to comply with the protocol.

          -  The patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Hypoxic conditions for half an hour are considered harmful, e. g. in patients with
             shunts.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Discontinuation of diuretic medication for one day is considered harmful. (Reason:
             Bladder distension is a sympathoexcitatory stimulus and shortens experimental time. In
             order to prevent these shortcomings three measures are taken: Dispensation with
             beverages and diuretics as well as complete bladder voiding immediately before the
             experiment.)
