  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last few years, most researches about hepatic complication after chemotherapy focused on
      hepatitis B virus (HBV). With adequate prophylaxis and monitor, HBV-related hepatitis flares
      can be prevented. In contrast, cancer patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are
      traditionally considered as relative safe to receive chemotherapy. However, two large
      retrospective studies recently showed that severe hepatitis could develop in 14-27% lymphoma
      patients with chronic HCV infection, including 3-4% hepatic failure. The risk factors to
      predict severe hepatitis are pre-treatment elevated ALT level and liver cirrhosis. Due to the
      lack of prospective studies, the dynamic changes of serum HCV RNA levels and the association
      of hepatitis are still unclear.

      Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell
      lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma and several
      reports showed higher prevalence of HCV infection among DLBCL patients than the controls. HCV
      infected DLBCL patients are reported to have distinct clinical characteristics, such as
      older, more with elevated LDH levels, and more with extra-nodal involvement. Regarding the
      impact of HCV infection on prognosis, the results are conflicting. Taiwan is an endemic area
      of HCV but there are limited reports addressing the clinical characteristics and prognosis in
      this unique population.

      Therefore, the investigators initiate a prospective, multi-center observational study to
      clarify the dynamic association between serum HCV RNA levels and hepatitis in HCV-infected
      lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy.
