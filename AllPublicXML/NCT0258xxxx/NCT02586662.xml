      Background: Patterns of scapular dyskinesis have unique scapular kinematics and associated
      muscular activation. The characteristics of scapular dyskinesis may be associated with
      functional disability. The investigators investigated whether the level of shoulder function
      and primary dysfunction items were different in each unique pattern of scapular dyskinesis.
      The factors associated with shoulder dysfunction in different patterns of scapular dyskinesis
      were identified.

      Methods: Participants with unilateral shoulder pain were classified as having a single
      dyskinesis pattern (inferior angle prominence, pattern I; medial border prominence, pattern
      II) or a mixed dyskinesis pattern (patterns I+II). Clinical measurements with the Flexilevel
      Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF score), shoulder range of motion, anterior/posterior
      shoulder tightness, and pectoralis minor index were recorded. These clinical measurements,
      3-D scapular kinematics (electromagnetic-based motion analysis), and associated muscular
      activation (electromyography on the upper, middle, and lower parts of the trapezius and
      serratus anterior muscles) during arm elevation were analyzed for associations with
      functional disability.

        Function-related factors in patients with scapular dyskinesis. Fifty-one participants (40
        males; 11 females; mean age= 22.5±2.4 years; mean height=171.4 ± 8.0 cm; mean weight= 64.9
        ± 10.5 kg) were recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were from 18 to 50 years old and had unilateral shoulder pain around the
             shoulder complex, including the glenohumeral, scapulothoracic, sternoclavicular, and
             acromioclavicular regions, while performing shoulder movement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded if they had a history of shoulder dislocation, fracture, or
             shoulder surgery within the past 1 year, or a history of direct contact injury to the
             neck or upper extremities within the past 1 month. Subjects who had neurological
             disorders or demonstrated pain (VAS&gt;3) during the overall testing procedures were also
             excluded.
