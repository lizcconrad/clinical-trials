      This study evaluates the effects of four infusions of 3BNC117 in preventing or delaying
      rebound of viral load during a brief treatment interruption of standard ART, and its safety
      during a brief analytical interruption of antiretroviral therapy.

      The proposed study is a Phase II, open label study to evaluate the safety, antiretroviral
      activity and pharmacokinetics of four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected individuals on
      combination ART and during a brief analytical treatment interruption (ATI).

      Study participants will be administered four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117, administered
      at 30 mg/kg on day 0, week 12, week 24 and week 27. Antiretroviral therapy will be
      discontinued 2 days after the third 3BNC117 infusion (week 24), until week 36.

      The ART regimen will be resumed at week 36 or sooner if plasma HIV-1 RNA level is ≥ 200
      copies/ml, CD4+ T cell count drops &lt; 350 cells/microliter, and results are confirmed upon
      repeat measurement during the next weekly scheduled visit. If plasma HIV-1 RNA level is ≥
      1,000 copies/ml, the participant will be asked to return for a repeat measurement prior to
      the next scheduled visit, and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed. ART will also be
      resumed early if the participant becomes pregnant or if otherwise clinically indicated. If
      ART is resumed before week 27, the fourth 3BNC117 infusion will not be administered.

      Participants will be followed weekly during the analytical treatment interruption phase for
      safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. CD4+ T cell counts will be
      monitored every 2 weeks during the analytical treatment interruption phase.

      Participants may remain off antiretroviral therapy after week 36, with weekly viral load
      monitoring, if viral rebound does not occur by week 36.

      All participants will be followed for a total of 60 weeks from enrollment.
