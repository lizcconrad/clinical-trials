  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of
      delivering online, adaptive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided and gated stereotactic
      body radiation therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian cancer on a novel,
      integrated Co-60 MRI treatment machine. To best assess this technology, the investigators
      will focus on patients that have no more than three sites of progressive disease within the
      central thorax, liver, and/or non-liver abdominopelvis to receive adaptive, MRI-guided and
      gated SBRT with MRI simulation. Patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two
      weeks. By adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, expected toxicity will be within the
      current standard of care but will allow adaptation based on daily anatomic changes. The
      prescription dose will be determined based on hard normal tissue constraints, and capped at
      10Gy per fraction. Although the long term goal will be to achieve improved local control and
      disease-free survival with reduced toxicity, the present study will be driven by the short
      term goal of demonstrating the feasibility of this novel treatment approach for recurrent or
      metastatic ovarian cancer.

    <description>Radiotherapy will consist of stereotactic body therapy, to be given over five fractions, delivered once daily or once every other day for a period of one to two weeks, for a total of five treatments.
Patients will be planned for an initial dose of 35Gy to the planning target volume (PTV), with dose adaptation and reduction allowed based on safety constraints that are generally accepted, up to a maximum allowed total dose of 50Gy in five fractions to the PTV.
All patients will undergo both CT and MRI simulation in positioning appropriate for the specific treatment site</description>
