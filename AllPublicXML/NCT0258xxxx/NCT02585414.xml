  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition with potential severe
      consequences for affected patients. DES can be either caused by decreased tear production or
      increased tear evaporation, both leading to an instable tear film. Despite many efforts,
      generally accepted methodologies to diagnose, assess the severity and monitor DES are still
      lacking. Moreover, widely used clinical methods such as tear break up time (BUT), fluorescein
      staining of the cornea or Schirmer test only poorly reflect patients´ complains.

      One of the main problems in the diagnosis and treatment of DES is that the most critical
      component - the tear film itself - is difficult to characterize. The development of new
      ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography systems allows now for the direct
      visualization of the human tear film and for the non-invasive in-vivo measurement of tear
      film thickness (TFT). The investigators could recently show that this system provides
      excellent reproducibility and is able to assess even subtle changes in TFT induced by
      therapeutic interventions. However, to which extent tear film thickness is associated with
      other standard clinical measures of DES is currently unknown. In the present study, the
      investigators set out to test the hypothesis that ocular TFT is a new and good surrogate
      parameter for the assessment of the severity of DES.

      Consequently, the aim of the study presented in this protocol is to investigate whether and
      if so, to what extent clinical signs of DES and reported symptoms are reflected in ocular
      TFT. For this purpose, a cross sectional study in healthy subjects and patients with DES will
      be performed. This should allow the investigators to more specifically characterize the role
      of the tear film in DES and to assess whether measurement of TFT with OCT can be a promising
      surrogate parameter for the diagnosis and the follow up of DES.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers

          -  Men and women aged over 18 years

          -  Normal findings in the medical history unless the investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant

          -  Normal ophthalmic findings, ametropia &lt; 6 Dpt.

        Inclusion criteria for patients with DES:

          -  Men and women aged over 18 years

          -  DES patients will be included based on three questions:

               -  (1) &quot;Have you ever been diagnosed (by a clinician) as having dry eye syndrome?&quot;

               -  (2) &quot;Do you currently use artificial tear eyedrops or gel?&quot;

               -  (3) &quot;For the past three months or longer, have you had dry eyes? (This is
                  described as a foreign body sensation with itching and burning, sandy feeling,
                  not related to allergy).&quot;

          -  Normal ophthalmic findings except dry eye syndrome

          -  History of glaucoma

          -  Treatment with corticosteroids in the 4 weeks preceding the study to topical treatment
             with any ophthalmic drug in the 4 weeks preceding the study (topical lubricants for
             patients with DES are allowed)

          -  Ocular infection or clinically significant inflammation
