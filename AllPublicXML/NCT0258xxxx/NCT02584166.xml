    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomised controlled trial will test the hypothesis that a multifaceted program
      with psychological intervention in morbidity mortality conferences (MMC) improve care quality
      and reduce the rate of morbidity mortality perinatal in diverse obstetric care settings.

    <description>38 maternity units with allocated to the intervention group: coordinating team disseminated protocols related to the management of cases, and organized mortality morbidity conferences (MMC) in each unit with staff concerned. These MMC were realized by the same outside medical binomial composed of a midwife and an obstetrician (outreach visit with a leader ship). Among the 38 maternity units, MMC were performed with the medical binomial and professionals of human science in 20 units to identify the defense mechanisms manifested by medical staff which could disturb the decision making. In the others 18 units, MMC were performed with only the outside medical binomial. Coordinating team defined with teams the area of improvement before each MMC. 3 or 4 MMC were performed according to their activity.</description>
