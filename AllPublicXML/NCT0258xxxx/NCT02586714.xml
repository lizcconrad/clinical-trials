      This study examined the relationships between maternal body composition, placental function,
      and fetal nutrition and body composition, and sought to determine the most accurate method of
      maternal body composition analysis in late pregnancy. This project integrates body
      composition analysis, nutrition, and metabolic factors to study the impact of maternal body
      composition and diet on placental function and fetal growth.

      Research Project: The proposed enrollment of 41 pregnant women at term (&gt;37 weeks gestation)
      was completed in September 2013. The subjects underwent four body composition measurements
      (bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold thickness, BodPod, and deuterium dilution) and dietary
      surveys along with a fasting blood draw. The subjects returned 2 weeks postpartum for repeat
      measurements along with a DEXA scan.

    <description>Subjects presented for their study visits in the morning following an overnight fast. During the first visit, at 37-38 weeks' gestation, they underwent four measures: 1) ADP, 2) TBW volume by deuterium (2H2O) dilution, 3) skin-fold thickness (SFT), and 4) bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). To determine maternal FM (kg) without the presence of the fetus or placenta, and to avoid radiation exposure to the fetus, subjects returned for a second study visit two weeks postpartum for repeat measurements by the above methods plus a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) scan. Statistical analysis was performed using the R package Method Comparison Regression, version 1.2.1. Estimates of mean FM (kg) were compared by analysis of variance.</description>
