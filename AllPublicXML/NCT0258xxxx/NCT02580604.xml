  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Declines in serum calcium during exercise may cause increases in markers of bone resorption.
      This study will determine if preventing the decline serum ionized calcium experienced at the
      onset of exercise through the use of a &quot;calcium clamp&quot; also prevents increases in blood
      biomarkers associated with bone resorption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo two identical walking exercise sessions on a treadmill. One session
      will occur until continuous calcium infusion and the other will be under continuous saline
      infusion. C-telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, total calcium, and serum ionized calcium will
      be monitored to distinguish differences in bone activity under the two conditions.

    <measure>Change in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes of exercise and 4 hours of recovery</time_frame>
    <description>PTH will be measured during baseline, throughout exercise, and during recovery at regular intervals. We are looking to see how PTH changes over the course of the exercise and recovery period in both the calcium and saline. We anticipate that PTH will be higher in the saline condition versus the calcium. We expect that men and women will respond similarly.</description>

We are looking to see how PTH changes over the course of the exercise and recovery period in both the calcium and saline. We anticipate that CTX will be higher in the saline condition versus the calcium. We expect that men and women will respond similarly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults aged 60-80 y

          -  Currently taking a bisphosphonate medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of medications (other than bisphosphonates) in the past 6 months known to affect
             bone metabolism (e.g., thiazide diuretics, oral glucocorticoids)

          -  Bone Mineral Density (BMD) t score &lt; -3.0 at the total hip or lumbar spine

          -  Known disease or condition associated with intestinal malabsorption

          -  Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate
             of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 based on the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation

          -  Chronic hepatobiliary disease, defined as liver function tests (AST, ALT) &gt;1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal; if such values are obtained on initial screening and
             thought to be transient in nature, repeated testing will be allowed

          -  Thyroid dysfunction, defined as an ultrasensitive TSH &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 mU/L; volunteers
             with abnormal TSH values will be re-considered for participation in the study after
             follow-up evaluation by the PCP with initiation or adjustment of thyroid hormone
             replacement

          -  Serum calcium &lt;8.5 or &gt;10.3 mg/dL Serum 25(OH)D &lt;20 ng/mL; volunteers with abnormal
             serum 25(OH)D values may be re-considered for participation in the study if serum
             25(OH)D is &gt;20 ng/mL after vitamin D supplementation

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as resting systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic BP&gt;90
             mmHg; participants who do not meet these criteria at first screening will be
             re-evaluated, including after follow-up evaluation by the PCP with initiation or
             adjustment of anti-hypertensive medications

          -  History of type 1 or type 2 diabetes

          -  Cardiovascular disease; subjective or objective indicators of ischemic heart disease
             (e.g., angina, ST segment depression) or serious arrhythmias at rest or during the
             graded exercise test (GXT) without follow-up evaluation will be cause for exclusion;
             follow-up evaluation must include diagnostic testing (e.g., stress echocardiogram or
             thallium stress test) with interpretation by a cardiologist

          -  Diagnosis or history of asthma
