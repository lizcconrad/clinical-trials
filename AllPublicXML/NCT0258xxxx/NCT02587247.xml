    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the sensitivity of the immuno-PET PET / CT pretargeted with the bispecific
      anti-CEA x anti-HSG TF2 antibody and IMP-288 peptide labeled with Gallium-68 for imaging
      potential candidate patients for surgery of local resection of one or more metastases at
      diagnosis or during relapse CCR expressing CEA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injection of a bispecific anti-CEA x anti-HSG antibody TF2 (120 nmoles) and 30 hours later
      IMP-288 peptide labeled with gallium-68 (3 to 6 nmoles/150 MBq). A TEP imaging acquisition is
      plannified 60 min after the 68-Ga injection.
