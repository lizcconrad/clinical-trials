      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center, randomized trial.

      STRATIFICATION FACTORS:

      Subjects will be stratified based on serum total alkaline phosphatase at baseline and extent
      of disease (described below). Randomization will occur within stratification group.

        -  Extent of Disease: &lt;6 skeletal metastases with no visceral metastases versus ≥6 skeletal
           metastases or visceral metastases.

        -  Serum total alkaline phosphatase at baseline: normal vs abnormal. Abnormal alkaline
           phosphatase is defined as &gt; 130 IU/L.

      Early Induction or Late Induction status will not be a stratification criterion.

      TREATMENT SCHEDULE: CONTROL ARM A

      All subjects will receive androgen deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist (any LHRH agonist
      such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate is acceptable) or a LHRH antagonist
      (degarelix) or bilateral orchiectomy, with dosage determined by the treating physician. Route
      of administration and cycle days will be administered as per package insert. Androgen
      deprivation therapy with LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist will be given continuously.

      All subjects will receive bicalutamide, 50 mg Oral (PO) Daily

      TREATMENT SCHEDULE: EXPERIMENTAL ARM B

      All subjects will receive androgen deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist (any LHRH agonist
      such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate is acceptable) or a LHRH antagonist
      (degarelix) or bilateral orchiectomy, with dosage determined by the treating physician. Route
      of administration and cycle days will be administered as per package insert. Androgen
      deprivation therapy with LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist will be given continuously.

      All subjects will receive bicalutamide, 50 mg oral (PO) daily

      All subjects will receive Radium-223 dichloride, 50 kBq (1.35 microcurie) per kg body weight,
      intravenous (IV bolus) every 28 days for 6 injections

      The following laboratory values must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8.0 g/dL (80 g/L) without packed RBC transfusion

        -  Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except subjects with
           Gilbert's Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN (≤ 5 x institutional
           ULN in the presence of liver metastases).

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN (≤ 5 × institutional ULN
           in the presence of liver metastases).

      Renal:

        -  Estimated Creatinine Clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥ 30 mL/min

          -  Subjects must fall into one of the two populations below:

          -  EARLY INDUCTION GROUP: Subjects who have started androgen deprivation therapy
             (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist therapy with or
             without an anti-androgen agent) a maximum of 28 days before registration and who
             otherwise meet all the eligibility criteria.

          -  LATE INDUCTION GROUP: Subjects who have NOT started any androgen deprivation therapy
             (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist therapy with or
             without an antiandrogen agent).

          -  Anti-androgen receptor antagonist therapy must be bicalutamide. Subjects already

             therapy or for biochemical recurrence must have been discontinued at least 6 months
             prior to registration.

          -  Prior surgical treatment for prostate cancer is allowed but must have been completed
             at least 14 days prior to registration and any toxicity from such therapy must have
             recovered to ≤ grade 1 per CTCAE version 4 criteria by the time of registration.

          -  All subjects, including those who are surgically sterilized, must be willing to use an
             effective method of contraception (barrier method of birth control or abstinence) from
             the time informed consent is signed until 6 months after completion of protocol
             therapy.

          -  Subjects must consent to bank whole blood, serum, plasma for future unspecified
             studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer. Prior cytotoxic
             chemotherapy with curative intent in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting is allowed
             but must have been completed at least 6 months prior to registration. No cytotoxic
             chemotherapy is allowed during protocol specified therapy.

          -  Prior concomitant therapy with ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide or abiraterone acetate
             or enzalutamide (MDV3100) or intent to treat with the above. Concurrent megestrol for
             hot flashes is allowed.

          -  Prior or ongoing bisphosphonate (e.g,. zoledronic acid) or RANKL inhibitor (e.g.
             denosumab) use is NOT allowed except when used solely for osteoporosis and strictly
             per guidelines for that indication. Bisphosphonate or RANKL inhibitor cannot be
             initiated for any indication during protocol specified therapy without consent of the
             sponsor-investigator of the study.

          -  Prior systemic radiotherapy with strontium-89, samarium-153, rhenium-186 or
             rhenium-188.

          -  Diagnosis of aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, myelodysplasia or any of the
             other bone marrow failure states.

          -  Any neuroendocrine differentiation including small cell carcinoma on histology or
             cytology.

          -  No prior malignancy except for non-melanomatous skin cancer or non-muscle invasive
             bladder cancer or adequately treated Stage I or II cancer (adequacy at discretion of
             treating investigator) from which the subject is currently in complete remission, or
             any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for at least 3 years.

          -  History of or active CNS metastasis (brain, leptomeningeal or cord compression). Brain
             imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the subject has no neurologic
             signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis. Subjects with neurological symptoms
             are recommended to undergo a head CT scan (with or without intravenous contrast) or
             brain MRI (with or without intravenous contrast) to exclude brain metastasis. If brain
             imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for CNS disease. Skull bone
             involvement without neurological impact by prostate cancer is allowed.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent within 28 days prior to registration.
             Subjects must not be treated with any other investigational agent while on protocol
             specified therapy.

          -  Prior hemibody external radiation. Any external radiation therapy must have been
             completed at least 14 days prior to registration. Any toxicity from such therapy must
             have recovered to ≤ grade 1 per CTCAE version 4 criteria by the time of registration.

          -  Clinically significant infections as judged by the treating investigator. Subjects
             must not have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active
             chronic hepatitis B or C, life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer, or any serious
             medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially
             interfere with participation in this study. Subjects should be tested for hepatitis B
             or C or HIV infection during screening only if they are considered by the investigator
             to be at high risk for these infections.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to bicalutamide.

          -  Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or procedure that could interfere with the GI
             absorption or tolerance of bicalutamide, including difficulty swallowing oral
             medications.

          -  Grade III/IV cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria
             (i.e., subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical
             activity or resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without
             discomfort), symptomatic pulmonary embolism within 3 months, unstable angina pectoris,
             myocardial infarction within 6 months, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia as
             determined by the treating physician.
