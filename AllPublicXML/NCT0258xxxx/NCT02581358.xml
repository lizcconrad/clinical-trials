      The purpose of the study is to investigate the validity of Scolioscan for quantitative
      assessment of curve severity in scoliosis using x-ray radiographs as the gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a three dimensional spinal deformity, in both the coronal plane, sagittal and
      transverse planes. Quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis is important for
      patient management. At present, Cobb angle measurement in the frontal plane using standing
      postero-anterior X-ray radiograph is the gold standard for scoliosis evaluation. Taking x-ray
      involves irradiation and is not without risk especially over repeated exposures for follow-up
      visits. With advancement of ultrasound technology which is radiation-free and noted to be
      useful as a tool for musculoskeletal imaging, an ultrasound system designed for evaluation of
      spinal deformity called Scolioscan has been developed. It comprises of a freehand 3D
      ultrasound imaging system with an enhanced frame structure for supporting the patient to
      maintain the posture during scanning and a software for measuring curve deformity in terms of
      Cobb angles. Previous studies on validity of ultrasound assessment for back deformity
      involved a pilot group of subjects. Based on these promising pilot results, we plan to carry
      out a formal study to investigate the validity of Scolioscan for quantitative assessment of
      curve severity in scoliosis using x-ray radiograph as the gold standard for comparison.

    <description>To assess the scoliotic patient, a 3D ultrasound imaging system (the Scolioscan) was developed. The system composes of an ultrasound scanner with a linear probe, a frame structure, an electromagnetic spatial sensing device and a dedicated PC program for imaging and data collection, processing, visualization, analysis, and assessment. The spatial sensor was attached to the ultrasound probe for spatial information collection and calibration. The Scolioscan will generate ultrasound images of the spine for quantitative assessment of the curve deformity in terms of Cobb angles.</description>
