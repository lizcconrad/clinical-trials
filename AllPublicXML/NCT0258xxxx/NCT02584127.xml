      Korean Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is prevalent among Korean American men. Quitting is Winning, an internet-based,
      cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation program, was developed using community-based
      participatory research principles.

      A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate whether participants were more likely to
      complete the program and quit smoking at 6-month follow-up with additional reinforcement
      including financial incentives for program completion and interim surveys.

    <description>The High Reinforcement (HR) condition included five monthly, online interim surveys with financial incentives for these assessments and also for program completion. All participants completed an eligibility survey and a baseline survey. All participants were offered a financial incentive to complete the six-monh followup survey. All participants were provided access to a six step, cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation program self-administered online.</description>
