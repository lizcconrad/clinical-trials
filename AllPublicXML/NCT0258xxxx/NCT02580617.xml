  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-CD for the treatment of crohn'
      disease. ALLO-ASC-CD is intravenous infusion containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose-derived stem cells are directed to injured tissue, and reduce inflammation.
      Furthermore, their immunomodulatory effects are significant for treating immune-related
      diseases, such as crohn's disease. Finally, ALLO-ASC-CD may provide a new option in treating
      a crohn's disease.
