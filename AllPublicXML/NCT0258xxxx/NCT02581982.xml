  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel and pembrolizumab works in treating patients
      with urothelial cancer that has not responded to previous treatment and has spread to other
      places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving paclitaxel together with
      pembrolizumab may be an effective treatment for urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.

      II. To calculate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immune effects of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel. II. To
      associate immune effects with tumor response. III. To explore changes in immune-regulatory
      micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as biomarkers of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
