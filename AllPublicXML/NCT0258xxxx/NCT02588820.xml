  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study to evaluate the impact of extremely early ART in the dynamics of viral reservoir,
      immune activation and inflammation in patients with HIV-1 infection of less than 20 days
      (Fiebig stages I-II) compared to patients with infection of 20-100 days (Fiebig stages
      III-V), to induce HIV functional cure.
