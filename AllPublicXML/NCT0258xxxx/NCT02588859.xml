      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective, observational study which would be
      conducted in India to understand the usage and effect of saxagliptin as first add-on therapy
      after metformin. The study will enroll Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients who were
      inadequately controlled with metformin alone and have been recently prescribed saxagliptin as
      an add-on to metformin.

      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective, observational study which would be
      conducted in India to understand the usage and effect of saxagliptin as first add-on therapy
      after metformin. The study will enroll Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients who were
      inadequately controlled with metformin alone and have been recently (i.e. within past 15
      days) prescribed saxagliptin as an add-on to metformin.

      The Investigator/designee would get signed informed consent from potential subjects of the
      study. The patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled in the study. These patients will then be assigned a patient identification number
      for the study. The Investigator/designee will collect the information as per the study
      schedule. This will be considered as Visit 1 of the patients. The patients will be managed as
      per the routine clinical practice of the physician for their condition and this study will
      neither interfere/advise the Investigators/designee for any drug/medication to be prescribed
      to the patients nor prescribe any intervention to them.The enrolled patients would then be
      asked to visit their respective study sites after 3 months ( +7 days) for the Visit-2 of
      study.

      Around 50 study centers throughout India will be selected with a goal of enrolling up to 1500
      patients (approximately 30 subjects each per site). The study will be initiated after
      obtaining written approval of Independent/Institutional Ethics Committee and written Informed
      consent of the patient.
