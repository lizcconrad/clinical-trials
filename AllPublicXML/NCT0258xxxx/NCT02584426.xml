  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PU) are skin breakdowns that often form after blood flow in the skin is
      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention, PUs still
      represent a major health risk for persons with SCI. PUs and other skin breakdowns are at risk
      for becoming infected; it is not uncommon for many different types of &quot;bugs&quot; to be found in
      the wound. It has been assumed that the presence of these organisms did not impede wound
      healing or skin graft survival. The current proposal will use a new type of procedure that
      involves the direct injection of an antibiotic (in saline) into the skin beneath the wound;
      it is then distributed throughout the wound using a second device that uses sound waves. The
      study will determine if the antibiotic treatment and the standard of care improves the rate
      wound closure compared to the standard of care alone in persons with SCI and a chronic
      pelvic-region PU.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, age 18 to 79;

          2. Chronic (e.g., duration of injury at least 6 months), stable SCI (regardless of level
             of neurological lesion);

          3. American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) designation of A or B with
             no sensation in the pelvic region;

          4. At least one Stage III or IV PU in the pelvic region (e.g., ischial or trochanteric
             regions) that has not shown signs of healing for a period of at least 1 month; and,

          5. Hemoglobin A1C ≤7.0%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Persons who are candidates for or elect to have reconstructive flap surgery of the PU;

          2. Unresolved osteomyelitis diagnosed by clinical impression and supported by one or more
             of the following: 1) history and examination of the pressure ulcer (i.e., visible
             bone), 2) bone contact on sterile probe, 3) bone that has lost its normal consistency,
             4) magnetic resonance imaging, or 5) open bone biopsy;

          3. Hemoglobin A1C &gt;7.0%;

          4. Psychopathology (documentation in the medical record or history of self-abusive
             behavior specific to PU healing which may or may not include major or minor
             psychiatric illness (that may conflict with the study objectives;

          5. Acute illness or systemic infection;

          6. Allergy to cefazolin;

             York Heart Association functional classification of 3;

          9. Previously diagnosed active malignant disease;

         10. Suspicion of skin cancer at the PU site (i.e., clinical evaluation is currently
             on-going);

         11. Life expectancy less than 12 months;

         12. Nephrosis, hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy;

             equivalent steroid dose) within the past 3 months;

         14. Diminished mental capacity;

         15. Inability or unwillingness of subject to provide informed consent; or,
