      This randomized phase III trial studies the side effects of and compares apixaban and
      dalteparin in reducing blood clots in patients with cancer-related venous thromboembolism.
      Venous thromboembolism is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein and then breaks
      off and moves through the bloodstream. Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous
      thromboembolism. Apixaban and dalteparin are drugs used to prevent blood clots from forming
      or to treat blood clots that have formed. It is not yet known whether apixaban or dalteparin
      is more effective in reducing blood clots in patients with cancer related venous
      thromboembolism.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
      embolism (PE), fatal PE, or arterial thromboembolism.

      II. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or any episode of clinically
      relevant non-major bleeding.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive apixaban 10 mg orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and
      lower-dose apixaban 5 mg PO BID on days 8-180.

      ARM II: Patients receive dalteparin 200 international units (IU)/kg/day subcutaneously (SC)
      once daily (QD) on days 1-30 and lower-dose dalteparin 150 IU/kg/day SC QD on days 31-180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

    <description>Patients will be analyzed according to the drug they received. Major bleeding events observed after 7 days will be described separately. The frequency of major bleeding events will be summarized separately by treatment arm. The cumulative incidence of major bleeding at 6 months from treatment initiation and its associated 95% confidence interval will be estimated separately by treatment arm using a cumulative incidence function, treating death without bleeding as a competing risk. A Cox proportional hazard model will be used to determine the point estimate for the hazard ratio (comparing apixa</description>

    <description>A similar analysis as described for the primary safety analysis will be used. The impact of baseline covariates on the safety outcome will be explored by adjusting for them in the Cox models. The frequencies of the separate components contributing to the safety outcome will be described. Incidence of adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA Dictionary.</description>

The impact of baseline covariates (location of DVT, renal clearance, age, sex, mobility at randomization, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease) on the efficacy outcome will be explored adjusting for them in the Cox models. There is no adjustment for multiple comparisons. This analysis will be conducted at the one-sided type I error of 0.05. The assumption of proportional hazards will be checked for all Cox models (including primary and secondary endpoints) using graphical methods as log(-log)-plots and plots of scaled</description>
