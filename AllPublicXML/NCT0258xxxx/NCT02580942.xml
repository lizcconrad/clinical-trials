      Asthma is a common chronic disease with an estimated 300 million worldwide. Treating Winter
      Diseases in Summer of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of asthma has a long history.
      But there are less related clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to assess whether
      Acupoint Sticking in Treating Winter Diseases in Summer is effective in the treatment of
      chronic asthma.

      After screening period, participants will undergo a physical examination, lung function,
      blood and induced sputum collection while being randomly assigned to one of the following 2
      groups for 6 weeks during summer dog days of treatment:

      Group A will receive acupoint sticking treatment of Chinese herbal medicine and magnetic
      stickers once every two daysï¼› Group B will receive acupoint sticking treatment of Chinese
      herbal medicine and sham magnetic stickers once every two days.

      Questionnaires to assess asthma control and quality of life will be completed. A physical
      examination, blood collection, and induced sputum collection will occur at selected visits.
