      The purpose of this study is to determine which regimen is better for esophageal squamous
      carcinoma in concurrent chemoradiation(CCRT),paclitaxel or S1 plus cisplatin.

      Radiotherapy:Patients will be conducted CT simulation, and three-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy (3DCRT) was performed. 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions a week, with a
      total dose of 60-66Gy will be delivered for all patients by 6-MV-X-ray of linear accelerator.

      Chemotherapy: Patients will be concurrently administered with irradiation every 3 weeks with
      PT regimen (cisplatin of 20 mg/m2/d, d1-3; PTX(paclitaxel)of 135mg/m2/d, d1) for 4 cycles or
      PS regimen (cisplatin of 20 mg/m2/d, d1-3; S1(Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil Potassium Capsule)of
      50mg/m2/d, d1-14) for 4 cycles. For the first 2-cycles of chemotherapy they will be
      concurrently given with irradiation and the remained 2 cycles, after irradiation.
