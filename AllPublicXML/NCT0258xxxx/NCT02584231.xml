  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from nocturnal enuresis (starting from the age of 5 till adulthood) are
      all treated with the same dose of desmopressin, i.e. 120mcg once daily. In treatment
      resistant enuresis, this dose is doubled: those patients take 240mcg once daily. A pilot
      study performed at our department showed a correlation between weight and plasma
      concentration when a fixed dose of desmopressin oral lyophilisate formulation was given to
      the pediatric patient (older than 6 years). This study will investigate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of desmopressin in young children, less than 8 years old.
      Additionally, the efficacy of desmopressin oral lyophilisate formulation in urinary
      concentration testing will be evaluated
