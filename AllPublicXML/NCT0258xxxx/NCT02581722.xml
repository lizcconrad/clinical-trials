    <textblock>
      A new Male Circumcision (MC) device, PrePex, has shown great promise as a way to radically
      shift the MC landscape. PrePex is an innovative circumcision device requiring no injected
      anesthesia, sutures, or sterile settings. Moreover, it is designed for use by minimally
      skilled healthcare professionals rather than surgeons. Two initial studies conducted in
      Rwanda in 2010 and 2011 demonstrated an excellent safety profile when the procedure was
      performed by skilled physicians

      Rwanda Has also completed a third study to assess the safety and efficacy of MC when
      performed by nurses using PrePex in both rural and urban hospitals, Device safety was
      assessed by the rate of clinical adverse events and device-related incidents attributed to
      the PrePex device and its procedures, the study report was shared with the WHO Male
      Circumcision Technical Advisory Group. On February 2011 the WHO provided Rwanda with
      recommendation to phase in MC scale up with the PrePex device on adults. Moreover the WHO
      recommended Rwanda to study the PrePex for use on adolescent population, starting on ages
      15-17 and thereafter on ages 12-14 and 10-12.
