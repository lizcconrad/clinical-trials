  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) provides service to individuals with some of the most severe
      brain injuries and intensive care needs in Canada. These patients often require prolonged
      intensive care admissions, lengthy hospital stays, involvement of many health professionals,
      and long-term support for ongoing care requirements. Many hospitals face resource
      limitations, specifically involving the health disciplines and their ability to provide
      frequent intervention.

      It has been proposed that multisensory stimulation (i.e. exposing the patient to various
      sights, sounds, smells, etc.) in the early stages of brain injury recovery may result in
      improved responsiveness/cognitive function.

      Previous research has indicated a potential benefit for early multisensory stimulation
      intervention for patients with severe brain injury. However there is still not enough
      conclusive evidence to confirm whether the intervention is truly effective. The investigators
      are proposing a pilot randomized controlled study (placebo-controlled, double-blinded) to
      determine the feasibility and examine the effectiveness of early multisensory stimulation
      with patients following severe brain injury who remain in a coma, vegetative state, or
      minimally conscious state. Eligible patients will be randomized to a control group (standard
      care + family/caregiver education) or an intervention group (standard care + family/caregiver
      education + early sensory intervention). Data regarding number of patients enrolled, amount
      of intervention completed, percentage of outcome data collected, patient's level of
      responsiveness and cognitive function will be collected before and after the intervention
      period, using several outcome measures. The investigators hope to determine the feasibility
      of conducting this type of study within this clinical setting and the effectiveness of
      multisensory stimulation with this patient population.
