  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study to evaluate lot-to-lot consistency in the
      manufacture of Bovine Rotavirus Pentavalent Vaccine (BRV-PV).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate lot-to-lot consistency in the manufacturing of Rotavirus
      vaccine by testing the vaccine in infants in order to demonstrate equivalence in the
      induction of specific anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies across three production lots. The study
      will also examine the potential interference of vaccine with UIP vaccines that will be
      administered concurrently by assessing non-inferiority in the immune responses to those
      vaccines when administered with / without the study vaccine.
