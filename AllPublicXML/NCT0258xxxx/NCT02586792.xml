    <textblock>
      The study will be an open-label phase 2 clinical trial of a single dose of an inactivated
      H7N9 influenza vaccine (non-adjuvanted). The subjects of the study will have previously
      participated in DMID trial 07-0023, evaluating inactivated Influenza A/H7N7 vaccine. In the
      previous study healthy adults 18 to 40 years old were randomized to receive two doses, 28
      days apart, of placebo or 7.5, 15, 45, or 90 ug of the influenza vaccine by IM injection in a
      1:1 ratio (N=25/vaccine group and 25 in placebo group). The primary objectives are to 1)
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose A/H7N9 vaccine in individuals who
      previously received two IM doses of an A/H7N7 vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve and 2) To
      assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses against A/H7N9
      approximately 28 days following receipt of a single dose of A/H7N9 vaccine in individuals who
      previously received two IM doses of A/H7N7 vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.

      This is a Phase II, open-label study in up to 50 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 50
      years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all entry criteria. The study is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a
      monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine (45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL) manufactured by
      Sanofi Pasteur administered to healthy adults who previously received two doses of monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur or one or two doses
      of placebo in Protocol 07-0023. All subjects will receive a single dose of the inactivated
      influenza A/H7N9 vaccine delivered intramuscularly. Reactogenicity will be measured by the
      occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions from the time of the study
      vaccination Day 1/Visit 01 through 8 days after the study vaccination. Unsolicited
      non-serious adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of the study vaccination
      through roughly 28 days after the study vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and
      new-onset chronic medical conditions will be collected from the time of the study vaccination
      through roughly 6 months after the study vaccination. Immunogenicity testing against A/H7N9
      and A/H7N7 antigens will include performing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained immediately prior to the study
      vaccination, and roughly 8 and 28 days after the study vaccination. An additional 60 mL of
      venous blood will be drawn immediately prior to the study vaccination, and roughly 8 and 28
      days after the study vaccination for exploratory cellular immunology assays. The duration of
      this study for each subject will be roughly 6 months. The primary objectives are 1. to assess
      the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus
      vaccine in individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. 2. To assess the serum
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses against A/H7N9 roughly 28 days following
      receipt of a single dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in
      individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent inactivated
      influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. The secondary objectives are 1. To
      assess study-vaccine related unsolicited non-serious adverse events following receipt of one
      dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in individuals who previously
      received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine
      or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. 2. To assess new-onset chronic medical conditions following
      receipt of one dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in individuals
      who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7
      virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.3) To assess the serum HAI antibody responses against
      A/H7N9 at baseline and about 8 days following receipt of a single dose of a monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in individuals who previously received two
      intramuscular doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7
      vaccine-naïve. 4. To assess the serum neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses against A/H7N9
      at baseline and roughly 8 and 28 days following receipt of a one dose of a monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.

        able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study
        visits. 3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 to 50 years old, inclusive. 4. Are in good
        health*. *As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated
        based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses
        or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, that would
        affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of the study
        vaccination. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days.
        This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency of as a
        result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior
        to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
        insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
        class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any
        change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by
        the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a
        deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
        medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
        reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or
        condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and the study vaccination
        are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical
        condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to the
        subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to the study vaccination. Note:
        Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as
        outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.1.2), herbals, vitamins, and
        supplements are permitted. 5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0F. 6. Pulse is 50 to 115
        bpm, inclusive. 7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive. 8. Diastolic blood
        pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive. 9. Women of childbearing potential** in sexual
        relationships with men must use an acceptable method of preventing conception*** from 30
        days prior to 60 days after the study vaccination. **Not sterilized via tubal ligation,
        bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or successful Essure® placement (permanent,
        non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at
        least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if
        menopausal. ***Includes, but is not limited to, sexual abstinence, monogamous relationship
        with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the
        subject receiving the study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with
        spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing®, and licensed hormonal
        methods such as implants, injectables or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill). 10. Women of
        childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours
        prior to the study vaccination. 11. Received either two doses of an inactivated influenza
        A/H7N7 vaccine or one or two doses of placebo in DMID Protocol 07-0023 or have not received
        an influenza A/H7 vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:
