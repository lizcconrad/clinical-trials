  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients admitted to hospital with acute cerebrovascular stroke, we want to study the
      relationship between hair cortisol levels and biomarkers of inflammation and the clinical and
      radiological severity of the stroke and the degree of neurological disability being tested in
      three months and one year after.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will include patients hospitalized due to an acute cerebrovascular stroke. A number
      of 30 patients aged 40-70 will be included. Within 48 hours of the event, blood inflammatory
      biomarkers, and scalp hair sample for cortisol will be taken. All recruited patients will
      undergo full neurological examination and the severity of the stroke will be rated using
      NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). 3 months and one year later neurological
      examination and rating of neurological disability will be determined using Rankin Scale.
