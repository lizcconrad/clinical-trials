  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test the feasibility of an intervention programme to
      reduce cognitive impairment due to cancer treatment. The investigators want to find out how
      acceptable the intervention and procedures are for cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention programme will consist of the following components: education about
      cancer-related cognitive impairment, relaxation techniques, compensatory techniques,
      goal-setting and lifestyle advice. Each session will last between 90 and 120 minutes, once a
      week for six weeks. The intervention will be delivered in a group setting, in a non-clinical
      environment by the investigators.

      The investigators aim to recruit 54 cancer patients from the local Cancer Centre onto the
      study. The cognitive functioning of cancer patients due to start chemotherapy will be
      assessed. Each patient's cognitive function will be reassessed after completion of
      chemotherapy and additional self-report measures will be administered. Patients who
      demonstrate cognitive decline over the course of chemotherapy will be invited to take part in
      the intervention programme. All other patients will be given an information sheet and advised
      to contact a member of their health-care team if they notice any changes in their cognitive
      function. The investigators aim to take 30 patients through the intervention. At the end of
      the intervention, each participant will complete an intervention evaluation questionnaire in
      addition to the cognitive functioning assessments and self-report measures.

    <description>The investigators aim to assess the acceptability of the intervention programme and its procedures to patients enrolled in the study. This is a non-validated questionnaire designed specifically for this study. Participants are required to rate the verbal and written information about the study, advice about the study, overall intervention, specific intervention components, each assessment visit and procedure, length of time of intervention and assessment visits on a three- or five-point likert scale. Open-ended questions asking participants to provide further information were provided.</description>

             processes. Use of commonly prescribed anti-depressants e.g. Monoamine Oxidase
             Inhibitors (MAOIs), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin
             Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) or Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) is
