    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the
      study is to validate two measures for growth hormone deficiency in children, the Treatment
      Related Impact Measure of Childhood Growth Hormone Deficiency (TRIM-CGHD) and the Treatment
      Burden Measure of Childhood Growth Hormone Deficiency (TB-CGHD).
