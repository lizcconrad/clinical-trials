  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review the use of surgeon applied liposomal release
      anesthetic (Exparel) for post operative analgesia.

      Hypothesis: Surgeon applied use of liposomal related anesthetic provides excellent post
      operative analgesia. Immediated and 72 hour narcotic use will be significantly impacted by
      the use of this modality.
