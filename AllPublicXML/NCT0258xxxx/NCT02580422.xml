    <textblock>
      Cachexia is a systemic catabolic syndrome with apparent effect on skeletal muscles, tolerance
      to chemotherapy, early toxicity and quality of life; however, its effect on cardiopulmonary
      function is not well understood. Preclinical studies demonstrated diaphragmatic muscle
      wasting(29) and left ventricular wasting and fibrosis associated with mouse cachexia
      models.(40) Many patients, who experience cancer cachexia, describe a generalized debility
      and a sense of breathlessness(41) despite adequate oxygenation in the peripheral blood as
      measured by pulse oximetry. Whether this is related to deconditioning associated with
      chemotherapy or related to direct effect on cardiac and diaphragmatic muscles remains
      unknown. In this pilot study, the investigators propose to perform a preliminary evaluation
      of the cardiopulmonary function in patients with pancreatic cancer, who are likely to develop
      cachexia, to assess for the feasibility of performing a larger prospective study to
      understand the impact of cancer cachexia on cardiopulmonary function. This pilot study will
      provide the foundation to potentially identify cachexia in early stages (pre-cachexia) to
      develop pharmacological or exercise based interventions to prevent or delay its progression.
      Based on clinical experience and published literature, it is expected that 60-70% of patients
      will have &gt;10% weight loss during the course of this disease. More commonly, this is
      associated with clinical or radiographic disease progression, but certainly it can happen
      throughout the course of the disease even without disease progression.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the feasibility of performing a prospective cardiopulmonary and physical function
      assessment in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are expected
      to develop cachexia.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To measure the changes in maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximal inspiratory
           pressure (MIP) in patients with progressive PDAC and/or cancer associated cachexia

        2. To measure changes in strain echocardiography in patients with progressive PDAC and/or
           cancer associated cachexia

        3. To assess functional changes in patients with progressive PDAC and/or cancer associated
           cachexia

        4. To assess body composition changes associated with cachexia or disease progression

        5. To measure the levels of cytokines from peripheral blood in patients with cachexia

      Procedures:

      All study procedures will be done at two time points (T1=baseline or study entry, T2=at
      disease progression or development of cachexia). Patients will undergo echocardiography with
      strain evaluation at Indiana University Health Echocardiography Laboratory and pulmonary
      function tests as per institutional guidelines at IUH PFT laboratory at University Hospital.
      Patients will also have 20mL (2 red top tubes) of blood drawn for the studies outlined in
      Section 7.5. Standard of care labs will be taken from the patient's medical records. Patients
      also will be evaluated using three standardized functional assessment tools commonly utilized
      in physical rehabilitation: 1) 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test; 2) 6 Minute Walk Test; and 3) grip
      dynamometry. Standard of care CT scan obtained at the time of tumor assessment will enable
      the investigators to assess body muscle mass as described in Section 7.4. In addition, the
      investigators will administer three standardized survey tools to assess quality of life and
      prior level of function: 1) The Short Form 36 (SF-36); 2) Lower Extremity Functional Scale
      (LEFS); and 3) Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).

      Sample Size:

      Due to the risk of clinical deterioration or drop out of the study and inability to undergo
      T2 evaluation, the investigators will plan on enrolling 133% of desired number of subjects,
      accounting for 33% missing T2 data. This is likely a high number; however, this will enable
      data collection from 12-15 patients at both time points and all proposed tests.
