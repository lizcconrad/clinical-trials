  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of persons actively waiting on the national solid organ waiting list continues to
      rise while the number donating organs has failed to keep pace. This is a particular problem
      for some portions of northeastern Ohio where the donation rate is as low as 32%. Adolescents
      are an important group for organ donation efforts as they have not yet applied for a driver's
      license and represent the majority of future donors. Yet many organ donation interventions
      have not targeted adolescents. The investigators propose to utilize existing high school teen
      summits developed by our Consortium partners to evaluate the effectiveness of existing
      donation interventions. Together, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled 2x2
      factorial trial to evaluate the independent and combined effects of two donor education
      interventions on consent for organ donation on the electronic Ohio Donor Registry. One
      thousand six hundred students over the age of 15.5 years from Cleveland-area high schools
      will be enrolled.
