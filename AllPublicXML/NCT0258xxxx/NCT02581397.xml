    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the non-inferiority of Suppository Transpulmin and Suppository Guaiacol
      compared to Transpulmin Syrup in the treatment of cough with secretion of infectious origin
      in children between two and six years old. One third of participants will receive Suppository
      Transpulmin, the other one third will receive Suppository Guaiacol and the last one third
      will receive Transpulmin Syrup.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suppository Transpulmin, Suppository Guaiacol and Transpulmin Syrup are administered in the
      treatment of cough with secretion of infectious origin.

      Each Suppository Transpulmin contains eucalyptol, menthol, camphor and guaiacol. The main
      pharmacological activity of eucalyptol occurs in the respiratory tract, playing expectorant
      action, fluidity and antiseptic. There are indications that eucalyptol be a controller
      inflammatory mediators, intervening directly in the pathophysiology of airway inflammation.
      On the other hand, menthol has spasmolytic effect antiflatulent, antipruritic, analgesic and
      antiemetic the mucosae, which has been shown in various studies in vitro and in vivo. In
      addition, effective against many kinds of bacteria and fungi. Camphor, in turn, is used in
      respiratory dysfunction due to secretolytic and antispasmodic properties (bronchi). Finally,
      the guaiacol is classified as an expectorant because it believes that promote increased
      sputum volume and decrease its viscosity, resulting in effective coughing. However, despite
      its extensive use in recent decades, there are few randomized controlled trials demonstrating
      its efficacy and tolerability, especially in pediatric participants.

      Each Suppository Guaiacol contains guaiacol, whose action was explained previously.

      Finally, each Transpulmin Syrup contains guaifenesin, which chemically it is a glyceryl ether
      guaiacol. Thus, their structures are similar, and their pharmacological effects and
      mechanisms of action. The addition of the hydroxyl group increases the hydrophilicity, making
      the compound more soluble, thus being more suitable for pharmaceutical syrup form.
