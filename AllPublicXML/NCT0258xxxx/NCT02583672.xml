  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure levels of blood and brain chemicals related to
      oxidative stress and inflammation in healthy volunteers and individuals with Type 1 Gaucher
      disease (GD1) to see if these levels are altered by GD1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will also examine if there is a change in these blood and brain chemicals
      in GD1 patients after receiving oral N-acetylcysteine (&quot;NAC&quot;), which is available both as a
      prescription medication and as a dietary-supplement product, that has antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects. Any changes the investigators may find in chemical levels may
      improve our understanding of the disease and could eventually lead to better treatment
      options. This is a multi-center study of approximately 50 people with Type 1 Gaucher disease
      (GD1) and healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will have 3 study visits over the course of
      3 months. Procedures will include review of medical history, blood draws at each visit, and
      an MRI scan at the third visit. GD1 patients will have 7 study visits over the course of 9
      months. Procedures include review of medical history, blood draws at each visit (multiple
      draws from an IV catheter at Visit 6), neurological exams, pain and fatigue questionnaires,
      and MRI scans (at Visits 3 and 6). In addition, GD1 patients will be given oral NAC at Visit
      3, to begin taking twice a day for 90 days. All MRI scans will be done at the University of
      Minnesota in Minneapolis.

    <time_frame>At 90 days and at 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the concentration of glutathione (GSH) in the brains of subjects with Gaucher disease type 1 at 90 days after enrollment, which is the baseline measure. It will again be measured at 180 days after enrollment. These measures will be obtained using NMR spectroscopy (often referred to by the acronym &quot;MRS&quot;). The MRS study will take place over approximately 1.0 hour and will generate measurements of GSH levels from 2-3 brain regions. Scanning may be done in multiple sessions if needed, but will not exceed 1.5 total scanning hours.</description>
