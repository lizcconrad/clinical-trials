  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Research has extensively documented the adverse impact that caring for an
      individual with an acquired brain injury can have including financial difficulties, social
      isolation, family tension and conflict, relationship difficulties, role adjustment and
      psychological distress (Foster et al., 2012). Research has indicated that Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) shows promise for increasing wellbeing and psychological flexibility
      in caregivers and could be a useful intervention for use with this population.

      Aims: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using an ACT
      intervention to enhance the wellbeing and the psychological flexibility of carers using the
      Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) framework. Methods: The current study
      is a randomised control design, exploring the feasibility of comparing the efficacy of an ACT
      intervention to Enhanced Treatment As Usual (ETAU), to improve the wellbeing of the carers of
      adults with an acquired brain injury (ABI). Participants will be recruited from the Brain
      Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) in Glasgow, Scotland and randomly assigned to either an
      ACT intervention group or TAU control group. Both will be assessed in parallel to one another
      completing a range of baseline and post-baseline measures. Applications: This feasibility
      study will provide information for further research on the utilisation of an ACT intervention
      to improve the wellbeing of carers and whether this is an acceptable intervention for this
      population.
