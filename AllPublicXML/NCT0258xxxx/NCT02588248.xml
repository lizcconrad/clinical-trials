  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blinded, prospective, randomized placebo-controlled
      study is to evaluate for change in endoscopic adenoma detection rates (ADR) with the use of
      peppermint oil solution vs placebo application during colonoscopy. The investigators
      hypothesize that ADR will be increased with the use of the peppermint oil solution and thus
      further reduce the risk of colon cancer by means of colonoscopy.

      Adult subjects who are undergoing colonoscopy for primary colorectal cancer screening or
      surveillance. The study will be carried out as a prospective, double-blinded, fully-masked
      randomized controlled trial. Prior to the trial entry, the participant's labs and medical
      record will be reviewed in the electronic records system. If the subject meets
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, he or she will be consented at bedside prior undergoing their
      scheduled procedure and receive standard care as otherwise. Experimental and placebo solution
      ingredients will be serially numbered and randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a variable block
      strategy and provided by the institutional investigational pharmacy. Research staff will draw
      up experimental or placebo solution in 4 syringes with a total of 20mL in each solution.

      The solutions are identical in appearance and endoscopic delivery. To prevent olfactory
      detection of the peppermint oil solution an essential oil diffuser will be used in all
      endoscopy rooms using the same oil as in the experimental solution. Endoscopists will be
      instructed to deliver the contents of one syringe sprayed via the endoscope in the cecum and
      one in the sigmoid colon. The contents of the other two syringes are to be delivered at the
      discretion of the endoscopist. After the procedure, endoscopists and study participants will
      be surveyed to determine if blinding was effective and to assess patient comfort levels,
      respectively. The primary and secondary end points will be determined on an intention to
      treat basis.
