  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite technological advancements directed towards the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary
      lesions, an optimal approach has yet to be designed. The potential advantages of catheter
      based techniques include the ability to utilize instruments smaller than the diameter of a
      conventional bronchoscope, thereby allowing better access to the lung periphery. The
      drawbacks of a catheter based approach include the relative inability to steer a conventional
      catheter, and the inability to perform direct visualization and airway inspection through a
      conventional catheter. This study will evaluate a novel steerable catheter system with
      optical capabilities and pair this with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy to biopsy
      peripheral pulmonary lesions.

    <description>-Primary outcome of diagnostic yield based on final cytology and/or histopathology will be determined from the results of the bronchoscopy. A biopsy that results in a specific diagnosis, either malignant or benign, that adequately explains the clinical scenario as determined by the treating physician, will be considered truly positive.</description>

    <description>-Pneumothorax will be documented by post-biopsy CXR or chest ultrasonography, and the number requiring intervention, such as chest tube placement, will be recorded. Significant hemoptysis will be defined as bleeding noted at the time of procedure that requires a change in the level of care (e.g. outpatient to inpatient or inpatient to ICU) or a blood transfusion. Other adverse events that are common to bronchoscopy will be monitored</description>

    <description>The bronchoscope will be inserted transorally into the tracheobronchial tree and a standard airway inspection will be performed.
Following airway inspection, the bronchoscope will be removed and the tip tracked steerable catheter with optical system will be advanced transorally through the vocal cords and into the tracheobronchial tree.
Once the tip tracked catheter has been advanced to the peripheral pulmonary target lesion, the optical SpinView system will be removed from the tip tracked catheter and the 1.4mm radial endobronchial ultrasound mini-probe will be inserted through the tip-tracked catheter into the lung periphery to confirm the presence of a peripheral pulmonary lesion and accurate navigation.
Once target confirmation has been performed using radial probe endobronchial ultrasound, biopsy of the peripheral lesion will be performed using biopsy forceps, brushes and aspiration needles.</description>
