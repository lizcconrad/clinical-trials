             MS.

             laboratory assessments which would compromise the safety of the patient.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly-effective method(s) of birth
             control and/or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy.

          -  Latent or active tuberculosis infection, verified by testing as per local practice.

          -  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Known Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection.

             sufficiently serious to preclude study participation.

          -  Prior history of invasive fungal infections.

          -  Any patient who, in the judgment of the Investigator, is likely to be noncompliant
             during the study, or unable to cooperate because of a language problem or poor mental
             development.

          -  Any patient in the exclusion period of a previous study according to applicable
             regulations.

          -  Any patient who cannot be contacted in case of emergency.

          -  Any patient who is the Investigator or any subinvestigator, research assistant,
             pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in
