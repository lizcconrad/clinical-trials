  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence has been arising that Botulinum toxin injections can relax smooth muscles fibers in
      the treatment of obesity and hyperactive bladder. Would a similar effect on cavernosal smooth
      muscles help in the treatment of resistant erectile dysfunction not responding to medical and
      injection therapy, thus avoiding surgical treatment options.

      The treatment group will be injected intracavernously with 50 units of BTX-A. The control
      group, 12 patients, will be injected with a normal saline injection.

      24 males with will be included in the study. All will be subjected for full history taking,
      general and genital examination. Penile duplex will be performed to assess a vascular
      etiology before the treatment and 2 weeks later. The patients will be randomized into a
      treatment group (12 patients) and a control group (12 patients).

      All patients will sign an informed consent. The treatment group will be injected IC with a
      trimix solution (20 ug alprostadil + 1 mg phentolamine + 30 mg papaverine) for color Doppler
      assessment, followed, next day by 50 units of BTX-A. The control group, 12 patients, will be
      injected with the trimix solution during penile color Doppler assessment followed next day
      with a normal saline injection. The erection hardness score (EHS) will be assessed during the
      Doppler exam.

      Procedure: At least 1 day after the penile color Doppler test, the patient is placed in the
      supine position flaccid and stretched penile length and girth would be measured from tip of
      the penis to the pubic bone will be done. A rubber band will be applied to the base of the
      penis. The skin will be prepped with alcohol swabs followed by the IC injection of 50 units
      of BTX-A. Direct pressure will be applied for 2 minutes. The rubber band will be removed
      after 15 minutes.

      Patients and controls will fill the Sexual Health Inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire and
      answer the the Sexual Encounter Profile questions 1 and 2 (SEP 2 &amp; SEP 3), and the global
      assessment question (GAQ) before and 4 weeks after treatment.

      The rational for selecting the minimum 2-weeks waiting period is to give a chance for the
      BTX-A to reach its maximum effect. Possible Risks include pain and prolonged erections.

    <description>Clinical assessment of the Erection hardness score (EHS) in both groups after ICI at baseline.
The Erection Hardness Score (EHS) is designed to measure the rigidity of erection. It ranges from 0 (no erection) to 4 (Fully rigid and hard erection).
0 - Penis does not enlarge.
- Penis is larger, but not hard.
- Penis is hard, but not hard enough for penetration.
- Penis is hard enough for penetration, but not completely hard.
- Penis is completely hard and fully rigid. The average score is reported for each group.</description>

The Erection Hardness Score (EHS) is designed to measure the rigidity of erection. It ranges from 0 (no erection) to 4 (Fully rigid and hard erection).
0 – Penis does not enlarge.

        <description>Assessment of the Sexual Health Inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire before treatment for both groups. It is a questionnaire that helps asses if the patient has erectile dysfunction (ED) and assesses its degree. Results range from 1 to 25. A score of 1-7 denotes Severe ED, 8-11 Moderate ED, 12-16, Mild to Moderate ED, 17-21 Mild ED, 22-25 No ED.</description>

Botulinum Toxin Type A: The treatment group will be injected intracavernously with a trimix solution (20 ug alprostadil + 1 mg phentolamine + 30 mg papaverine) for colour Doppler assessment, followed next day by 50 units of BTX-A.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Small sample size (24 total). Several questions need answering: Would a higher BTX-A give a better result? Would the results be maintained for the expected duration of BTX-A effectiveness period of 3 to 6 months?</limitations_and_caveats>
