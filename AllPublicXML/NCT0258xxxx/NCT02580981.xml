  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work performed by University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC)
      investigators has revealed previously unknown genomic mutations in children, adolescents, and
      young adults with high-risk B and T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using
      genomic and next generation DNA sequencing technologies, these investigators revealed that
      14% of children with high-risk ALL have &quot;Philadelphia chromosome-like&quot; (&quot;Ph-like&quot;) ALL.
      Patients with this form of ALL were found to have a significantly increased risk of treatment
      failure and death.

      Further work revealed that there are more than 40 distinct gene rearrangements and fusions
      that can result in Ph-like ALL. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing some of these
      different gene fusions were sensitive to currently available drugs. This suggests that
      Ph-like ALL patients with these specific distinct gene fusions should be targeted in future
      clinical trials to be treated with appropriate therapy. Further work is also needed to
      identify other potentially targetable genetic alterations in ALL patients.

      Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genomic screening of all newly diagnosed ALL
      patients seen at UNM and to use this information to enroll patients onto available National
      Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) clinical trials. If an appropriate NCTN trial is not available,
      best clinical management will be pursued.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The work performed by UNMCCC investigators and others as described briefly above has provided
      major insights into the biologic and clinical features and the genomic landscape of Ph-like
      ALL, which is strikingly heterogeneous. Gene expression profiling and RNA/transcriptomic,
      exome, and whole genome sequencing have identified several distinct subclasses of kinase
      activating lesions in 91% of the Ph-like ALL cases studied to date, most commonly kinase and
      cytokine receptor gene rearrangements and fusions. UNMCCC investigators are now collaborating
      with Children's Oncology Group (COG) and the adult National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Cooperative Groups (Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) - American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), The Alliance) to develop
      national clinical trials for pediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA), and adult ALL
      patients that incorporate their genomic diagnostic screens, molecular diagnostics, and next
      generation sequencing studies to identify underlying genomic lesions in ALL and target
      patients to appropriate therapeutic regimens.

      In this feasibility study, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies will inform an acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia risk classification system, which may be adapted to identify patients
      who might benefit from targeted therapies; such patients will be targeted to NCTN National
      Treatment trials or UNMCCC-sponsored trials where appropriate, through detailed genomic data
      analysis performed under College of American Pathologists (CAP)/CLIA conditions and in
      individual case discussions in a Molecular Tumor Board.

      In addition, the association of race and ethnicity with the spectrum of ALL-associated
      genomic mutations in the New Mexico and regional ALL population, which includes a significant
      proportion of underrepresented minorities, will be studied. This may ultimately allow for the
      development of an ancestry-based risk classification system.

    <description>Newly diagnosed ALL patients at UNMCCC will undergo Low Density Array (LDA) card screening (a gene expression classifier for Ph-like ALL) at initial diagnosis. The proportion of LDA status (positive vs. negative) and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated based on the exact binomial distribution.</description>

    <description>Newly diagnosed ALL patients at UNMCCC will undergo Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) at initial diagnosis. NGS (exomic and transcriptomic) of a sufficient read depth (500-700x) will be employed to detect clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis. Statistical analysis will be primarily descriptive (e.g. frequency (proportion) of various mutations will be calculated).</description>

    <description>Genetic and molecular characterization as described for the Primary Outcome Measures will be summarized for patients who are enrolled on NCTN clinical trials and for those who are not enrolled on NCTN clinical trials. The two group comparisons (NCTN vs. non-NCTN) will be tested using non-parametric approach such as Wilcoxon sum rank test.</description>

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed by calculation of the following statistics: percent of patients who enrolled in NCTN trials, percent of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) that are completely evaluated over time, percent of patients for whom molecularly characterization is feasible and informative over the treatment course. All estimated proportions will be accompanied by exact 95% confidence intervals</description>

    <description>End-induction Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) will be performed using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved flow-cytometric assay at the Children's Oncology Group University of Washington Reference Laboratory. Molecular MRD will also be determined using research-based deep sequencing. MRD repeatedly measured across time points will be summarized using descriptive statistics (bar graph for High vs. Low status). Associations between the MRD and the treatment groups (LAD Positive vs. LAD Negative for NCTN and Non-NCTN treatment groups), using the exact Pearson Chi-Square test with Monte Carlo simulation at each time point will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Newly diagnosed ALL patients will undergo genomic studies listed in Primary Objective 1. Analyses will be performed on a bone marrow (BM) aspirate at initial diagnosis (patients with an absolute blast count of at least 1,000/μL, may submit 2 mL of peripheral blood at diagnosis for each 1 mL of required BM. In patients in whom the aspirate cannot be obtained, a core biopsy will be used).
In addition, flow cytometric analysis and deep sequencing will be used to characterize and monitor the molecular heterogeneity and clonal evolution of disease during front-line therapy. BM, blood, and buccal specimens will be collected on day 29 of induction treatment and possibly at a later time point if relapse occurs.</description>

    <description>Depending on the genomic testing results, patients with targetable genomic lesions will be enrolled onto available national clinical trials that are sponsored by the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) (COG and other adult NCI Cooperative Groups). If no suitable NCTN trial exists, appropriate therapeutic regimens (including currently accepted standards-of-care), alterations in therapy, or treatment with targeted agents to specific genomic lesions will be considered.</description>
