  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-site, open-label trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) used in
      combination with standard, cisplatin-based, definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients
      with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Approximately 39
      patients with Stage III-IVB SCCHN will be enrolled to evaluate both the safety and efficacy
      of this novel combination. Subjects will not be randomized and will all receive the study
      treatment.

      Treatment will consist of a loading dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV given 7 days prior to
      initiation of CRT (day-7). CRT with cisplatin 40 mg/m2 IV weekly and head and neck radiation
      at 70 Gy fractionated at 2 Gy once daily over 35 days, will begin on day 1. CRT will end on
      approximately day 46-50. Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV will continue following CRT in an adjuvant
      fashion starting on day 57 for an additional 5 doses, as tolerated, through day 141. Subjects
      will be evaluated for response following treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed
      Consent Form (ICF) through the final protocol-specified contact. After a screening phase of
      28 days, eligible subjects will receive treatment on Day -7 with a loading dose of the study
      drug. This will continue during concurrent therapy with cisplatin and radiation, which will
      begin on day 1. Treatment will continue until completion of therapy, documented confirmed
      disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents
      further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the patient, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements; or administrative reasons. After the end of treatment, each patient will be
      followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected
      for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the patient
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue for reasons
      other than disease progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until
      end of study disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing
      consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed by telephone for
      overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the Investigator is notified by
      Sanford Research to discontinue follow-up
