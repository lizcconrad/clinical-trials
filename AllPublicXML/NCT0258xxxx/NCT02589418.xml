      The investigators will assess the effects of manual acupuncture on experimental dental pain
      in 36 healthy subjects by means of subjective pain intensity ratings and pain-specific
      autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactions.

    <textblock>
      This psychophysical and -physiological study is the first part of a two-phase project which
      pursues to explore how acupuncture-induced pain modulation interacts with pain-specific brain
      processing patterns by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and by using an
      experimental dental pain model.

      In this preceding study, the characterization of manual acupuncture effects on the
      experimental dental pain model will be tested under laboratory conditions and without
      restrictions of an fMRI-measurement in order to provide a sound foundation for the following
      fMRI-experiment. Pain modulating effects of the manual acupuncture intervention (4 points:
      needle manipulation of bilateral large-intestine 4 (LI4), stomach 6 and 7 (ST6, ST7)
      ipsilateral to the stimulated tooth) will be compared to sham-acupuncture (insertion and
      manipulation of 4 non-acupuncture points) and a control intervention (no acupuncture) which
      will each be performed at 3 different days in a randomized order. Intervention effects on
      experimental dental pain will be assessed by testing of 36 healthy volunteers by means of
      subjective pain intensity ratings and pain-specific ANS reactions such as electrodermal
      activity and heart rate/respiratory changes. Besides laying the groundwork for the following
      fMRI experiment, this study could provide valuable basic insights into the dynamics of the
      tested manual acupuncture effects and further provide important knowledge for the planning of
      future clinical studies encompassing dental conditions and development of acupuncture
      treatments.
