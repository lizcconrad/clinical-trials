  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate whether the proliferative speeds of cultured cells
      using our method can be integrated into Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging
      classification for the possibility of personalized treatment and prediction the outcomes in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of at least 150 patients will be included and followed for at least one year. The
      proliferative speeds of cultured cells will be classified into (a) rapid proliferation of HCC
      cells with or without concomitant rapid proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts
      (CAFs), (b) rapid proliferation of CAFs alone, and (c) slow proliferation three groups. The
      definition for the rapid proliferation of cultured cells fits at least one of the following
      two items: (1) growth area of cultured cells at the 15th-28th day &gt; two times of the growth
      area measured at the 14th day, or (2) growth area of cultured cells at the 15th-28th day &gt;
      70% growth area of the 25 cm flask. The GraphPad Prism software version 4.03 (GraphPad
      Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) is applied for statistical analysis. Influence of the
      proliferative speeds of cultured cells on survival and cancer progression will be calculated
      by the logrank test. The statistical significance is defined as P &lt; 0.05.
