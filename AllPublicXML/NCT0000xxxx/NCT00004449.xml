      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of intensive one-on-one behavioral treatment in
      the home or neighborhood compared with at home, individualized, parent training in preschool
      aged children with autism.

      II. Identify intake measures that predict differences in outcome between subjects in the
      experimental group.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Children are randomized to receive either 35
      hours of intensive one-on-one behavioral treatment in the home and neighborhood for 2 years
      or individualized, in home parent training for 6 months.

      A common group of tests to evaluate autism are administered at intake, 12 and 24 months into
      treatment, and when patients reach age 6.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Diagnosis of autism based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview using the ICD-10 research
        criteria

        Ratio IQ score greater than 35 determined from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development

        --Patient Characteristics--

        Other:

        Must reside within 60 km (37.5 miles) of a treatment site

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
