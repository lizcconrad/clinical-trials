      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune
      cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell
      transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer or melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the safety of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or
           melanoma.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of all adverse events related to this treatment
           regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in terms of tumor regression, response
           duration, progression free survival, and overall survival in these patients.

        -  Measure the resulting chimerism and immune reconstitution in these patients after this
           treatment regimen and correlate with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. Immediately following each daily donor
      leukapheresis, patients receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) IV over 15
      minutes beginning on day 0 and continuing until the target cells are collected. Patients
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      If no graft versus host disease has developed within 4 weeks of allogeneic PBSC
      transplantation, patients with disease progression or recurrence who have residual donor
      hematopoiesis on chimerism analysis may receive donor T lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes.
      Patients may receive an additional course of donor T lymphocytes at the investigator's
      discretion.

      Patients are followed at days 30 and 100, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
