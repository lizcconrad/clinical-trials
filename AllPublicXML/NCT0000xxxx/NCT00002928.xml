      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with
      recurrent or progressive advanced epithelial ovarian cancer following previous paclitaxel.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the activity of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly schedule to
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed paclitaxel on a 3 or 24 hour infusion
      schedule. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly schedule
      in this patient population. III. Correlate response with quality of life outcomes, including
      symptom distress, performance status, and global quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a single center, open label study. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously
      every week as a 1 hour infusion. Patients receive prophylactic anti-allergy premedication
      prior to paclitaxel.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 25-30 patients accrued per year.
