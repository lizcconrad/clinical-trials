      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining the monoclonal
      antibody rituximab with dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and dexamethasone in treating
      patients with recurrent or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects of rituximab and dexamethasone in patients with
      recurrent or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the objective tumor
      response rate and duration of response at 2 months after initiation of therapy, and the
      percentage of patients with progressive disease. III. Determine the maximum response,
      duration of response, and progression free interval for patients who have not progressed
      after 4 weeks of therapy. IV. Determine the failure-free and overall survival of these
      patients on this regimen. V. Compare the response rate and survival rates to results for
      similar patients (historical and concurrent) who have received 4 weeks of rituximab without
      dexamethasone, and patients who did not receive maintenance rituximab.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV followed by rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      for one course. Two months after initiating treatment, patients are evaluated for disease
      progression. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive monthly dexamethasone and
      rituximab therapy for up to 10 additional months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, then every 6 months for years 3-4, and then yearly for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
