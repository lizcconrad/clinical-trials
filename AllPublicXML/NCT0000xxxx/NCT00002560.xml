      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining colony-stimulating
      factors, such as sargramostim, with monoclonal antibodies may be an effective treatment for
      advanced neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody 3F8 plus
      sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the antitumor effects of monoclonal antibody 3F8/sargramostim (3F8/GM-CSF) in
           patients with advanced neuroblastoma.

        -  Assess the biological effects of 3F8/GM-CSF in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV over 1.5 hours on days 0-4 and 7-11 and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV over 2 hours on days -5 to 11. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of progressive disease, HAMA response, or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years.
