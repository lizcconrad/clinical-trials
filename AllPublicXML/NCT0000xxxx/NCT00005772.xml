      This large multicenter trial tested whether cerebral cooling initiated within 6 hours of
      birth and continued for 72 hours would reduce the risk of death and moderate to severe
      neurodevelopmental injury at 18-22 months corrected age. Infants at least 36 weeks gestation
      with an abnormal blood gas within 1 hour of birth, or a history of an acute perinatal event
      and a 10-min Apgar score &lt;5, or continued need for ventilation were screened. Following a
      neurological exam, those with moderate to severe encephalopathy were randomized to a 72-hour
      period of total body cooling (cooling blanket, followed by slow re-warming). The study was
      conducted in two phases: Phase I (20 infants) were examined for the safety of an esophageal
      temperature of 34-35 C; Phase II (main trial, 200 infants) were evaluated for the safety and
      efficacy of an esophageal temperature of 33-34 C. Cardio-respiratory, electroencephalograms
      (EEGs), renal, metabolic, and hematologic status, and esophageal and abdominal skin
      temperature were monitored during the 72 hours of intervention. Surviving children were given
      neurodevelopmental examinations at 18-22 months corrected age and again at school age (6-7
      years of age).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia injury is an important cause of death and
      neurodevelopmental disability. Data from animal models suggest that brain cooling immediately
      after injury is neuroprotective. Experience with total body cooling during surgery,
      accidental near drownings, and one Phase I trial of term infants suggest that it is effective
      and safe in children.

      This large multicenter trial tested whether cerebral cooling initiated within 6 hours of
      birth and continued for 72 hours would reduce the risk of death and moderate to severe
      neurodevelopmental injury at 18-22 months corrected age. Infants at least 36 weeks gestation
      with an abnormal blood gas within 1 hour of birth, or a history of an acute perinatal event
      and a 10-min Apgar score &lt;5, or continued need for ventilation were screened. Following a
      neurological exam, those with moderate to severe encephalopathy were randomized to a 72-hour
      period of total body cooling (cooling blanket, followed by slow re-warming). The study was
      conducted in two phases: Phase I (20 infants) were examined for the safety of an esophageal
      temperature of 34-35 C; Phase II (main trial, 200 infants) were evaluated for the safety and
      efficacy of an esophageal temperature of 33-34 C. Cardio-respiratory, electroencephalograms
      (EEGs), renal, metabolic, and hematologic status, and esophageal and abdominal skin
      temperature were monitored during the 72 hours of intervention.

      Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 18-22 mos of age by masked certified examiners.
      The outcome at 18-22 months showed that whole-body cooling reduces the risk of death or
      moderate to severe disability in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

      Surviving infants were assessed at 6-7 years (school age).
