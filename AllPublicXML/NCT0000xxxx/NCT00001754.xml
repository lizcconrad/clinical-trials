  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the genes responsible for skeletal dysplasias (disorders of the
      skeleton) and short stature and define the range and type of medical problems they cause over
      time. It will investigate whether specific gene changes cause specific medical problems in
      these disorders and identify the signs and symptoms upon which their diagnoses must be based.

      Individuals with short stature or with a skeletal dysplasia known or suspected to be caused
      by a gene mutation (change) may be eligible for this study. Family members may also
      participate. Skeletal dysplasias under study include: achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia,
      achondrogenesis type II, hypochondrogenesis, Kniest dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias,
      Stickler syndrome; Shmid and Jansen metaphyseal dysplasias; pyknodysotosis, proximal
      symphalangism, brachydactyly types B C and E, Ellis van Creveld and related disorders,
      metatrophic chondrodysplasias, cartilage-hair hypoplasia and disorders with a skeletal
      abnormality that have not yet been defined but might be the result of a genetic defect.

      Patients will talk with two genetics specialists who will explain the study and its possible
      implications for the patient and family and answer questions. The patient's medical records
      will be reviewed, a personal and family history will be taken, and a physical examination
      will be done. Various other procedures that may be done include drawing up to 6 tablespoons
      of blood, some of which will be used for DNA (genetic) studies, X-rays, echocardiography
      (ultrasound of the heart), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), eye examination, hearing test,
      sleep study, sperm analysis and skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of skin done
      under local anesthetic). There may be additional evaluations by specialists in rheumatology,
      rehabilitation medicine and orthopedics. When the tests and examinations are completed (after
      2 to 3 days), a doctor will discuss the results with the patient. Patients whose DNA studies
      show that a gene change is responsible for their disorder will meet with a genetics nurse or
      counselor to review the results, express their feelings and ask any questions they may have.
      Patients may be asked to return to NIH every 6 months to 2 years for continued follow-up.
      Medical management will be provided primarily by the patient's own physician.

      Participating family members will be interviewed by telephone about their personal and family
      health history and will have a blood sample drawn for DNA testing. If a gene change is found
      that is responsible for the bone disorder or growth problem in the family, arrangements will
      be made for the family member to discuss the implications of the findings with a genetics
      specialist.

      We will investigate the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of human
      skeletal dysplasias and generalized short stature. Families with skeletal dysplasias or short
      stature of known or suspected genetic basis will be enrolled. Affected individuals or
      individuals suspected of having a skeletal dysplasia will undergo periodic clinical
      assessment and genetic analyses for the purpose of: 1) definition and characterization of
      phenotype, 2) determination of the natural history of the disorder, and 3) genotype/phenotype
      correlation. Genetic linkage studies may be performed for disorders in which the genetic
      bases is not yet known.

        Patients with known or suspected skeletal dysplasias or short stature and their family
        members of any age will be recruited worldwide from diverse medical communities including
        genetics, orthopedics, ophthalmology, and pediatrics.

        DISEASE CATEGORY I:

        Individuals and family members with a suspected or an established diagnosis of any FGFR3
        disorder, type II collagen disorder, Schmid metaphyseal dysplasia, pyknodysostosis,
        proximal symphalangism, or brachydactyly type C.

        DISEASE CATEGORY II:

        Individuals and family members with a suspected or an established diagnosis of a skeletal
        dysplasia in which the disease gene is not yet known, including: Ellis van Crevald,
        brachydactyly types B and E, and cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

        DISEASE CATEGORY III:

        Individuals and family members who have previously uncharacterized systemic manifestations
        suggestive of a skeletal dysplasias, with clinical findings of: disproportionate or
        proportionate short stature; and/or cleft palate; and/or detached retina; and/or history of
        loose joints or frequent joint dislocation; and/or history of, or family history of,
        premature arthritis.

        Short Stature Category I: Individuals with generalized short stature and their family
        members. This includes adults with abnormal stature as statistically defined from
        standardized growth charts.

        Must be able to give informed consent, older children (greater than or equal to 7 years
        old) who do not give assent, or persons who are wards of the state will be excluded from
        the study.
