      To determine the minimal effective (immunogenic) dose of vaccine in asymptomatic HIV-1
      seropositive individuals with &gt; 400 cells/mm3 (CD4). To determine the dose-response to a 4
      fold escalation of the immunizing dose. To describe both cellular and humoral immune
      responses to HIV-1 in the immunized individuals. To describe the effects of this immunization
      on general immunological, virological and clinical parameters. To evaluate the safety of
      injecting recombinant gp160 in this population. To evaluate the extent of variability between
      different lots of gp160 (arms C1 and C2). It might be possible to increase immune responses
      or to induce new types of immune responses to HIV in some infected individuals by means of a
      vaccine, which could result in an immunological, virological or clinical benefit.

      It might be possible to increase immune responses or to induce new types of immune responses
      to HIV in some infected individuals by means of a vaccine, which could result in an
      immunological, virological or clinical benefit.

      ORIGINAL DESIGN: Patients are randomized to one of five groups to receive, intramuscularly,
      one of four dosages of gp160 or hepatitis B vaccine as a control. Treatments are given at 0,
      1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and patients are followed for up to 2 years. Patients in any of the
      5 groups will have the option of switching to another dosage group if an interim analysis at
      6 months shows significant differences in patient response. AMENDED: 10/23/90 52 eligible
      patients are randomized to one of 6 study groups. Five groups of 8 individuals receive one of
      4 dosage levels of gp160 (Groups A, B, C1, C2, and D), and 12 patients receive a single
      dosage level of hepatitis B vaccine as a control (Group E). Per 2/19/92 amendment, patients
      may elect to continue receiving vaccine beyond 12 months, with the doses given either every 3
      months or every 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Acute use (&lt; 14 days) of acyclovir for Herpes simplex virus infection or ketoconazole
             for symptomatic Candida infections.

        An additional group of up to 20 patients may be added to the study. Patients from ACTG 148
        with a repeatedly negative delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction who have reached
        their third dose of ID gp160 at 32 mcg and have failed to develop new proliferative
        response have the option, after a 2-month interval, to enter this protocol.

          -  They must meet inclusion and exclusion criteria that apply to this protocol.

          -  Patients with CD4 counts of 400 - 500 cells/mm3 must be informed of the recommended
             zidovudine (AZT) therapy and sign an informed consent statement declining AZT therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Fever of &gt; 100 degrees F persisting for &gt; 15 days in a 30-day interval without
             definable cause.

          -  Recurrent oral candidiasis.

          -  Multidermatomal herpes zoster.

          -  Biopsy-proven hairy leukoplakia.

          -  Fatigue/malaise of &gt; 1 month duration that interferes with normal activities.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant central nervous system dysfunction as assessed by
             neurological exam.

          -  Involuntary weight loss &gt; 10 lbs or 10 percent of normal weight in a 6 month interval.

          -  Diarrhea (&gt; 3 stools/day) for more than 30 days without definable cause.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Antiretroviral agents of proven or potential efficacy or any potential immunoenhancing
             or immunosuppressive drugs.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to insect cells or baculovirus.

          -  Abnormal chest x-ray taken within 3 months of study entry.

          -  Systemic symptoms thought to be due to HIV infection (other than lymphadenopathy).
             Evidence of clinically significant central nervous system dysfunction as assessed by
             neurological exam.

          -  Unwilling or unable to give written informed consent.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 90 days of study entry:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), or any potential antiretroviral or
             immunomodulating agents.
