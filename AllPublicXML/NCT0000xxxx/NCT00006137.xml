      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the most sensitive outcome measures (functional or morphological) of
      a progressive renal injury in patients with IgA nephropathy.

      II. Determine which of these patients are destined to progress to further injury in order to
      target them for therapy.

      III. Elucidate the determinants of progression in those patients who exhibit evidence of
      either increasing impairment of ultrafiltration capacity or ongoing destruction of nephrons.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive oral enalapril daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo renal function studies every 6-12 months for 5 years. Patients undergo renal
      biopsy at 36-48 months after study entry.
