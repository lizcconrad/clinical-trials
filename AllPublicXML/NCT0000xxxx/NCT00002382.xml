      To offer an investigational agent (saquinavir) to people with HIV/AIDS who are in need of
      additional treatment options and are not eligible to enroll in ongoing clinical trials.

      Patients who no longer benefit from existing antiretroviral therapy and who are not currently
      enrolled in ongoing saquinavir trials are eligible for this compassionate treatment program.

      Patients who no longer benefit from existing antiretroviral therapy and who are not currently
      enrolled in ongoing saquinavir trials are eligible for this compassionate treatment program.

      Patients may be registered with the program through their physicians, who will be responsible
      for supervising the administration of treatment; following guidelines for saquinavir dose
      interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation; and assessing patient progress throughout
      the duration of the study. Access to saquinavir will be determined by a lottery system; 60
      percent of the program slots will be reserved for patients with CD4 counts of 50 or less and
      the remaining 40 percent of the slots will be devoted to patients with CD4 counts between 51
      and 300.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Sero-positivity for HIV -1 antibody by an ELISA test, with confirmation by an
             alternative method.

          -  CD4 count &lt;= 300 cells/mm3 (within 4 weeks prior to entry).

          -  Signed, informed consent from a parent or legal guardian for patients &lt; 18 years of
             age.

          -  Failed previous therapy with or be intolerant to other registered anti-retroviral
             drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Eligibility for any controlled clinical study of any experimental HIV therapy.

          -  Grade 4 hematologic and/or Grade 3 hematologic toxicity at baseline.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

        Known hypersensitivity to saquinavir or other protease inhibitors. 1. Drugs, such as
        rifampin and rifabutin, which induce hepatic enzymes are likely to result in decreased
        levels of saquinavir and, therefore, should be avoided where possible.

          -  Concomitant therapy and treatment should be kept at a minimum.

          -  Current participation in any study formally excluding concomitant treatment with
             experimental drugs.

             1. Saquinavir can be used in combination with other registered anti-retroviral drugs
             such as ZDV, ddC and/or ddl. Other not yet registered anti-retroviral drugs can be
             used in combination with saquinavir when these drugs are widely available in the
             respective country or when they are allowed in combination treatment in any on-going
             clinical study.

          -  Prophylactic treatment for any opportunistic infections.
