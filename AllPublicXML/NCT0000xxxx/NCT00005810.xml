    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's
      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus
      filgrastim in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to
      hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate (objective and PSA response) and duration of
      response to estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin with filgrastim (G-CSF) support in
      patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen
      in this patient population.

    <description>Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2. Filgrastim (G-CSF) SC is administered beginning on day 6 and continuing until hematopoietic recovery. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed stage IV adenocarcinoma of the prostate
        Failure on standard hormone therapy Measurable disease with any PSA Accurately measured in
        at least 1 dimension as at least 20 mm by physical exam for clinically palpable lymph nodes
        and superficial skin lesions or chest x-ray for clearly defined lung lesions surrounded by
        aerated lung OR those lesions measured as at least 10 mm by spiral CT scan OR Nonmeasurable
        disease with PSA at least 5 ng/mL Nontarget lesions including small lesions with longest
        diameter less than 20 mm by conventional techniques or less than 10 mm by spiral CT scan
        and truly nonmeasurable lesions including: Bone lesions Pleural or pericardial effusions
        Ascites CNS lesions Leptomeningeal disease Irradiated lesions unless progression documented
        after radiotherapy Documented progressive systemic disease despite at least 1 endocrine
        manipulation with either orchiectomy or LHRH agonist (which must be continued), or
        diethylstilbestrol For measurable disease: Objective evidence of increase of greater than
        20% in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from the time of maximal
        regression or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions For nonmeasurable disease: If bone
        only disease, appearance of 1 new lesion on bone scan attributable to prostate cancer along
        with a PSA of at least 5 ng/mL OR An elevated PSA (at least 5 ng/mL) that has risen
        serially from baseline on 2 occasions each at least 1 week apart Testosterone no greater
        than 50 ng/mL if no prior bilateral orchiectomy

        Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AST no greater

        myocardial infarction or significant change in anginal pattern within past 1 year No
        congestive heart failure No New York Heart Association class II-IV heart disease No deep
        venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within past 1 year Other: Fertile patients must use
        effective contraception No clinically significant peripheral neuropathy No known

        Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy No prior estramustine or suramin No other concurrent
        chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior
        antiandrogens Primary testicular androgen suppression (e.g., with an LHRH analogue) should
        not be discontinued Concurrent LHRH analogue allowed if no prior bilateral orchiectomy
        Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior radiation and
        recovered At least 8 weeks since prior strontium chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153
