  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate, in patients with tubercular or nontubercular mycobacterium infections with or
      without HIV infection, the safety of thalidomide use as judged by symptoms, physical exam,
      and studies of microbiologic, immunologic, hematologic, renal, and hepatic status. To
      demonstrate efficacy of the drug as judged by status of fever, nutrition, tuberculosis
      lesions, and immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive thalidomide or placebo orally at 9 PM the night before
