  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid
      nodule or thyroid cancer.

      The main purpose of this study is to further understand the methods for the diagnosis and
      treatment of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Many of the test performed are in the
      context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid nodules or
      thyroid cancer. Other tests are performed for research purposes. In addition, blood and
      tissue samples will be taken for research and genetic studies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate methods for preoperative diagnosis and therapy of
      thyroid cancer and to screen patients for participation in other protocols. Study subjects
      will include adults and children with thyroid nodules or cancer requiring diagnostic fine
      needle aspiration biopsy, surgery, radioiodine scanning or therapy for persistent or
      recurrent disease.

      In this natural history protocol, the use of methods for follow-up of patients using
      radiopharmaceutical tracers such as (131)I, (123)I, (99)mTc-Sestamibi, (111)Inpentetreotide
      and 18-FDG PET administered according to standard clinical practice indications, and
      68Gallium-DOTATATE (Octreotate)-administered per research protocol as indicated. All
      radionuclides will be administered according to standard clinical practice indications and
      published guidelines. The limitations and significance of serum thyroglobulin (Tg)
      measurement for diagnosing tumor recurrence will be assessed. The study will permit a
      continued evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of already established methods of
      administering (131)I therapy including the impact of pre-treatment dosimetric calculations
      and administration of lithium (a well established, yet not widely used, adjuvant to (131)I
      treatment), especially in selected cases of thyroid cancer in which high-dose (greater than
      150mCi) (131)I therapy is clinically indicated.

      Under this protocol, samples of FNAB, benign nodules and cancer tissue specimens, blood
      samples for research studies will be collected to assess new immunohistochemical and
      molecular markers, and other techniques to characterize tumors for correlation with
      diagnosis, response to therapy and prognosis. Blood and urine specimens will be collected for
      future clinical and research studies in both the hypothyroid and euthyroid state. Coded
      clinical data will be entered in the National Thyroid Cancer Registry in selected patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adults and children with known or suspected thyroid neoplasm will be considered for
        participation.

          1. Patients with thyroid nodules requiring evaluation and possible biopsy

          2. Patients with recent diagnosis of thyroid cancer requiring consultation and counseling
             about therapeutic options

          3. Patients with established thyroid cancer requiring specialized studies such as (131)I
             dosimetry

          4. Enrollment of high risk, non-iodine avid, inoperable thyroid cancer for standard
             treatment of screening for eligibility for other specific thyroid cancer protocols.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        1. Serious underlying medical conditions that restrict diagnostic testing or therapy such
        as renal failure, congestive cardiac failure or active coexisting non-thyroid carcinoma.
