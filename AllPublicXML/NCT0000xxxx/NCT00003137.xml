      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have advanced cancer of the stomach.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate, survival, and toxicity of previously untreated
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who are treated with irinotecan
      (CPT-11).

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients receive irinotecan (CPT-11) by IV over 90
      minutes every 3 weeks. Dosage modifications are made based on toxicity. Retreatment may be
      delayed another 3 weeks (for a total of 6 weeks) to allow for recovery from toxic effects.
      Patient is taken off study if they do not recover from toxic effects, unless cause is
      documented to be unrelated to CPT-11. Patients with stable disease or partial response
      continue on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients with
      complete response continue on treatment for another 2 courses and then are observed. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 3 years or until disease progression.
