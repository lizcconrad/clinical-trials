    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give WF 10 (TCDO) to
      patients with advanced HIV disease who cannot or will not take zidovudine, didanosine,
      zalcitabine, or stavudine. This study also examines how TCDO affects the levels of HIV in the
      body. TCDO is a solution delivered through a vein.
