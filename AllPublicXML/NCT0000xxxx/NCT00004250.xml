      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Infusing chemotherapy to the tumor area only may kill more tumor
      cells and cause less damage to healthy tissues.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying isolated limb infusion of chemotherapy to see how
      well it works in treating patients with melanoma or soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg
      that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of isolated limb infusion (ILI) with melphalan and dactinomycin
           in patients with primary or recurrent, unresectable regional melanoma or soft tissue
           sarcoma of the extremity.

        -  Determine the morbidity of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the expression of melanoma-associated antigens as well as cellular and humoral
           immune responses to these antigens in patients with regional disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fluoroscopic placement of angiographic arterial and venous
      catheters into the appropriate extremity. After the limb is warmed, melphalan and
      dactinomycin are rapidly infused into the isolated limb via the arterial catheter. Melphalan
      and dactinomycin are then recirculated for 20 minutes. Patients with little or no response at
      8 weeks may receive up to 2 additional treatments at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Patients are followed at 1-2 weeks, 3-4 weeks, 6-8 weeks, and then every 3-6 months
      thereafter as deemed necessary by the treating physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
