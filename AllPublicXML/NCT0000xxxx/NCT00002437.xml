  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether cidofovir (HPMPC) therapy administered by intravenous infusion can
      extend the time to progression of peripheral cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS
      patients. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of HPMPC therapy when administered by
      intravenous infusion in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis that is not immediately
      sight-threatening. To evaluate the virologic effects of intravenous HPMPC therapy on CMV
      shedding in urine, blood, and/or semen. To evaluate the impact of HPMPC therapy on visual
      acuity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Group A receives HPMPC by IV infusion
      weekly for 2 consecutive weeks (induction) and then every other week (maintenance) with oral
      probenecid and IV hydration. Group B receives no treatment until the time of retinitis
      progression (deferred treatment), at which time they receive the same regimen as Group A,
      provided retinitis progression is not immediately sight-threatening.
