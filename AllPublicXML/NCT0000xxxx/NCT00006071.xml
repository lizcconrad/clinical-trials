  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cells in the lining of blood vessels produce various substances that cause the vessels to
      dilate (relax) and constrict (tighten), thereby regulating blood flow. In patients with high
      blood pressure and high cholesterol, the blood vessels do not dilate properly. This study
      will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone-a drug used to improve the action of insulin in
      diabetic patients-on blood flow by examining its effects on endothelin (a substance that
      causes vessel constriction), and other substances produced by the vessel-lining cells.

      Adults with blood pressure recordings of 140/90 mmHg or higher on at least three separate
      days or with a blood cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dl may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood pressure
      recordings, blood and urine tests.

      This &quot;crossover&quot; study involves two separate treatment periods; that is, participants will
      take either rosiglitazone or placebo (an inactive look-alike pill) once a day for 8 weeks,
      then no drug for 4 weeks, and then the alternative treatment for the next 8 weeks. Patients
      will continue to take their high blood pressure medicines during the first 6 weeks of each
      treatment period. They will stop the medication 2 weeks before the following procedures,
      which are done at the end of each 8-week treatment period:

      Strain gauge plethysmography-A small catheter is placed through a needle into an artery at
      the bend of the arm for measuring blood pressure and drawing blood samples during the study.
      Pressure cuffs are placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band
      device) is placed around the forearm to measure forearm blood flow. When the cuffs are
      inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the
      flow, and the measurement is recorded.

      Small doses of four drugs-acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside and BQ-123-are
      given through the catheter. Acetylcholine slows the heart rate. Bradykinin stimulates the
      release of a substance that causes blood vessels to dilate and can lower blood pressure.
      Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure
      and heart failure. BQ-123 blocks the blood vessel-constricting activity of endothelin.

      Brachial ultrasound reactivity study-A baseline ultrasound image (picture produced using
      sound waves) of the brachial artery (artery located at the bend of the arm) is taken and
      blood flow measurements are recorded. Then, a pressure cuff is placed around the upper
      forearm, inflated for 5 minutes to stop blood flow to the forearm, and then released. Images
      of the artery and flow measurements are repeated. After a 15-minute rest, new baseline images
      are taken and flow measurements obtained. A small amount of nitroglycerin is then sprayed
      under the tongue and after 3 minutes, blood flow measurements and brachial artery images are
      recorded once more.

      Since the publication of the data of the San Antonio Heart Study, the link between metabolic
      and cardiovascular disorders has been increasingly recognized, as well as the features these
      disorders have in common: insulin resistance and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Therefore,
      we are interested in the mechanisms underlying the impairment of endothelial function in
      insulin-resistant states. In particular, we have recently found that insulin stimulates the
      vascular activity of both ET-1 and NO in the normal human vasculature. It is therefore
      reasonable to speculate that the occurrence of insulin resistance and/or endothelial
      dysfunction may lead to an imbalance in this mechanism with a resulting increased vascular
      activity of ET-1.

      A new class of insulin sensitizing agents, the thiazolidinediones, have been shown to
      possess, in addition to their numerous metabolic roles, positive effects on blood pressure
      and on vascular endothelial function, including decreased endothelin-1 production and reduced
      circulating levels of endothelial surface molecules. Based on these data, we plan to
      investigate the hypothesis that thiazolidinediones may improve both insulin resistance and
      endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize
      that treatment with rosiglitazone improves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in both
      conductance and resistance vessels, decreases vascular endothelin-1 activity and reduces
      plasma levels of leptin and of markers of endothelial activation.
