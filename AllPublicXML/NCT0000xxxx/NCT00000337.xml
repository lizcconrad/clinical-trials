      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of selegiline on the subjective and
      physiological effects of cocaine challenge in chronic crack abusers, and to evaluate clinical
      safety issues pertaining to selegeline, to cocaine and their interaction in a chronic crack
      dependent population.

      To develop a medication for the treatment of cocaine addiction using a medical human
      physio-neuro-psycho-immunology laboratory setting. To characterize this cocaine abusing
      population on a variety of psychological and physicologically measures over time from
      withdrawal through pere and post cocaine administration. To determine the effects of
      selegeline on the subjective and physiological effects of cocaine challenge in chronic crack
      abusers. To evaluate clinical safety issues pertaining to selegeline, to cocaine and their
      interaction in a chronic crack dependent population.
