      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of cysteine hydrochloride in preventing or decreasing
      photosensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups to receive cysteine hydrochloride orally
      twice daily, 2 capsules with breakfast and 2 with lunch. Group 1 receives cysteine
      hydrochloride in drug ingestion period 1 followed by placebo in period 2. Group 2 receives
      placebo in period 1 followed by cysteine hydrochloride in period 2. Both groups ingest
      placebo for 1 week between the periods. Each drug ingestion period lasts 8 weeks.

      Follow up phone calls are made at the end of months 1 and 3. All patients schedule follow up
      visits at the end of each drug ingestion period.
