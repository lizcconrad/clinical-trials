      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical efficacy of leuprolide, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHa), in treating infants with vision-endangering or large, disfiguring
      hemangiomas.

      II. Assess the impact of GnRHa on growth and development during infancy. III. Assess the
      safety of GnHRa in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender and by position of the lesion (periorbital vs nonperiorbital).

      All patients receive oral prednisone daily for 3 weeks. Patients are then randomized to
      receive either placebo or leuprolide IM every 3 weeks, while continuing oral prednisone.
      Tumors are assessed at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. If the tumor is not responding, the leuprolide will
      be administered every 2 weeks. Tumors are reassessed at 3 and 6 months, at which point the
      treatment is stopped. Responding patients are observed every 3 weeks for 3 months. If the
      tumor begins to grow again, leuprolide may be administered for another 3 months. Patients
      whose tumors grow rapidly during treatment may crossover to the alternate therapy, repeat the
      leuprolide or prednisone therapy, or undergo surgical excision.

    <criteria>

        -  Presence of hemangioma meeting at least one of the following criteria:
             Vision-threatening because of induced astigmatism or occlusion of the visual axis or
             proptosis Severe anatomic distortion compromising function of an organ or creating an
             unacceptable cosmetic outcome Other complications, e.g., Kasabach-Merritt consumptive
             coagulopathy, high-output heart failure, etc.

          -  No lesions that are clearly regressing before therapy

          -  No vascular malformations other than juvenile hemangiomas
