      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus ICI D1694 in treating
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ICI D1694 (TDX) when given with
      irinotecan (CPT-11) every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Describe
      the pharmacokinetics of TDX and CPT-11 when given in combination. III. Investigate the
      relationship between topoisomerase I expression in peripheral mononuclear cells and
      myelosuppression and/or gastrointestinal toxicity. IV. Investigate the effect of CPT-11 on
      thymidylate synthase expression in tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ICI
      D1694 (TDX) given in combination with irinotecan. Irinotecan is given intravenously on day 1
      and ICI D1694 intravenously on day 2. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalated
      doses of TDX until the MTD is defined; an additional 10-12 patients will be entered at the
      MTD to confirm this as a recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30-35 patients will be entered.
