  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and CSF penetration of combined ganciclovir and foscarnet treatment
      for presumed cytomegalovirus encephalitis or radiculomyelopathy.

      This study proposes to investigate the use of combined ganciclovir and foscarnet to maximize
      the antiviral regimen. Current evidence suggests that a combination of ganciclovir and
      foscarnet may be the most efficacious therapy and appears to be well tolerated. This study
      will provide key information regarding safety and CSF penetration of the drugs available for
      treatment of these lethal diseases. It will also provide preliminary information regarding
      virologic factors relevant to CMV CNS disease. The study will also provide further data about
      the natural history of CMV brain infection detected by a combination of symptom complex and
      PCR identification of CMV in CSF and the potential of semi-quantitative PCR evaluation of the
      CSF for the disease.

      PCR identification of CMV in CSF and the potential of semi-quantitative PCR evaluation of the
      CSF for the disease.

      Patients will be stratified by clinical syndrome as having either primarily A) encephalitis;
      or B) radiculomyelitis. If patient has combined encephalitis and radiculomyelitis, then the
      patient will be stratified as encephalitis. CMV therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet will
      first be given at an induction level and then a maintenance level. For the first 4 weeks,
      patients will be given foscarnet plus ganciclovir. Then for the following 20 weeks, patients
      will be given foscarnet plus ganciclovir with ganciclovir at a lower dose. NOTE: A maximum of
      10 patients that have proven to be intolerant to either foscarnet or ganciclovir may receive
      the alternate agent alone.

      NOTE: Ganciclovir experienced subjects will be given GCV at induction and maintenance doses
      if tolerated.

      NOTE: Induction doses will not be re-started in the face of clinical relapse on switching to
      maintenance therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

        Patients with treated, stable toxoplasmosis encephalitis with documented stable CT or MR
        scans may be enrolled if maintenance suppressive therapy is continued.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Encephalopathy or radiculomyelitis.

          -  CSF positive for CMV by PCR.

          -  Signed informed consent from a parent or legal guardian for patients &lt; 18 years.

          -  CSF cytological analysis should be obtained at the time of enrollment or within 2
             weeks prior to enrollment.

        NOTE:

          -  Co-enrollment is encouraged where study procedures do not conflict. Protocols
             investigating antiviral regimens with potential activity against CMV or other human
             herpes viruses will be ineligible.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Active CNS infection or malignancy, other than due to CMV or HIV.

          -  A positive CSF VDRL.

          -  Any evidence of active disease such as a substantial increase in cryptococcal antigen
             titer or positive culture. However, patients may be enrolled with stable, treated
             cryptococcal meningitis.

          -  A dermatomal or disseminated varicella-zoster infection within 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  An active, symptomatic systemic infection, other tan HIV or CMV, for which the patient
             is not receiving stable therapy for at least 30 days.

          -  Any other advanced disease likely to cause death in &lt;6 months.

          -  Known intolerance to both foscarnet and ganciclovir.

          -  Inability to safely perform a lumbar puncture.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Patients on prophylactic antiviral therapy at the time of study enrollment will not be
             allowed to continue this medication during the study. In the event of the appearance
             of HSV or VZV infections after enrollment in the study that require systemic therapy,
             acyclovir or other appropriate medication may be instituted.

          -  Patients may not receive ZDV therapy during the initial 4 weeks of the study.
             Concurrent ZDV therapy will be started during maintenance therapy if tolerated. Bone
             marrow sparing antiretroviral therapy may be used at the investigator's discretion.

        NOTE:

          -  Concurrent medications should be kept to a minimum because of possible interference
             with the assessment of both safety and pharmacokinetics. But medications absolutely
             necessary for the subject's welfare may be administered at the discretion of the
             investigator.
