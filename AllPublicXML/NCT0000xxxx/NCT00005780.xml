  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an experimental cancer vaccine for
      mantle cell lymphoma a form of cancer of the white blood cells called lymphocytes. Although
      standard treatments for lymphoma may achieve disease remission, none provides a cure.

      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma 18 years and older who have not been treated previously
      with chemotherapy may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened for eligibility
      with a medical history and physical examination. Other tests that may be required include
      blood and urine tests; lung function studies; imaging tests such as magnetic resonance
      imaging, computed tomography and X-rays; and biopsy (surgical removal of a small tissue
      sample) of tumor, bone marrow, or other tissue.

      Patients enrolled in the study will begin treatment with chemotherapy designed to reduce
      disease to a minimum that is, to achieve remission or shrink the tumor as much as possible.
      Chemotherapy will be administered on an outpatient basis over a period of around 12 to 18
      weeks in 3-week cycles as follows: prednisone by mouth on days 1 through 5; etoposide,
      doxorubicin and vincristine intravenously through (a vein) on days 1 through 5; and
      cyclophosphamide intravenously on day 5. Starting day 6, patients receive no chemotherapy for
      16 days. In addition, an antibody called rituximab, which attaches to lymphoma cells and may
      increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy, will be given on day 1 of the cycle. Patients
      will also receive a protein called G-CSF starting day 6 of the cycle and continuing until the
      white blood cell count recovers or until day 19. G-CSF is naturally produced by bone marrow
      and may boost the immune system. The chemotherapy drugs and rituximab are infused through a
      vein by means of a lightweight portable pump, which patients are taught how to use. Patients
      are also how taught how to give themselves G-CSF injections under the skin, similar to
      insulin injections.

      The first vaccination will be given at least 3 months after chemotherapy ends and will be
      repeated every 4 weeks for a maximum of 5 vaccinations. The vaccinations will be given in the
      clinic. Patients will also receive daily injections of GM-CSF, a growth factor naturally
      produced by bone marrow that can boost the immune system. These injections will be given the
      day of the vaccination and for the next 3 days.

      When vaccine therapy is completed, patients who were treated successfully will be followed
      with periodic clinic visits for follow-up examinations and tests. Patients in whom the
      lymphoma did not disappear entirely or who have a recurrence of disease will be advised of
      further treatment possibilities.

      Background:

        -  Mantle cell lymphoma presents a particular clinical challenge because it is aggressive
           and incurable with chemotherapy. Thus, novel treatment approaches are needed.

        -  In follicular center cell lymphomas, another incurable disease, recent evidence suggests
           that molecular complete remissions may be achieved following idiotype vaccination in
           patients who have achieved minimal residual disease with combination chemotherapy.

        -  These results suggest that idiotype vaccines may be able to induce a clinically
           significant immune response against lymphoma.

      Objectives:

        -  To assess if EPOCH-R/idiotype vaccination is associated with a median progression-free
           survival consistent with 36 months;

        -  To assess if rituximab affects generation of T-cell immunity against the idiotype.

        -  To compare T-cell immunity using two different methods of isolating the idiotype
           protein.

      Eligibility:

        -  Tissue diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  Previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. All stages of disease.

        -  Lymph node of greater than or equal to 2 cm accessible for biopsy/harvest or greater
           than 1000/microl of circulating tumor cells in the blood.

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3.

      Design:

        -  In the present study, we propose to investigate the efficacy of idiotype vaccine
           treatment in previously untreated patients with mantle cell lymphomas. In order to
           achieve minimal residual disease, patients will receive 6 cycles EPOCH chemotherapy and
           rituximab (EPOCH-R) followed by 5 idiotype vaccine injections.

        -  This study has completed accrual of 26 patients and is only open for follow-up.
