      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine taken by mouth in treating
      older patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in elderly patients with stage IIIB or
      IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with oral vinorelbine. II. Determine the time to
      progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in
      these patients. IV. Determine whether there is a perceived preference for this oral
      administration in these patients. V. Determine the quality of life of these patients when
      treated with this drug. VI. Assess individual variation in responses, pharmacokinetic
      parameters, and/or biological correlates in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vinorelbine on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 5 years.
