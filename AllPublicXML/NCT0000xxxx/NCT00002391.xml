  <brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine, Used With and Without 1592U89, in HIV-1 Infected Children Who Have Taken Anti-HIV-1 Drugs</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-Blind, Randomized, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of 1592U89/Zidovudine (ZDV)/Lamivudine (3TC) Versus the Combination of Zidovudine (ZDV)/Lamivudine (3TC) in HIV-1 Therapy-Experienced Pediatric Patients.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety, tolerance, durability of the viral load response and the antiviral
      activity of the 1592U89/zidovudine(ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC) regimen vs. ZDV/3TC regimen. To
      determine the clinical efficacy of the two regimens as measured survival, disease
      progression, weight growth velocity, and neuropsychological or neurological changes. To
      assess the development of viral resistance and relative pharmacokinetics associated with each
      regimen.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive blinded treatment with ZDV/3TC alone or in combination
      with 1592U89, orally for 16 weeks. If after the 16-week period certain criteria are met,
      patients may have the option to switch to open-label treatment for the remainder of the study
      period.
