  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While vaccination against cutaneous leishmaniasis, a chronic ulcerating protozoan infection
      of the skin, has been possible for decades using live parasites, the production and storage
      of live cultures are difficult. Since inoculation occasionally leads to severe infection,
      most experts now advocate against their use. We have shown excellent protection using a
      &quot;heat-killed&quot; vaccine that combines autoclaved leishmania antigen with recombinant human
      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) and aluminum hydroxide gel as adjuvants in a rhesus macaque model of
      disease. To assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans, we now propose a
      rhIL-12 dose escalation Phase I/II trial.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Male or non-pregnant female 18 - 50 years of age at the time of screening and willing to
        use effective birth control for one month post vaccination.

        Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination
        before entering into the study.

        Available to participate for the duration of the study (approximately 6 months).

        Able to give signed informed consent.

        May not have received an investigational leishmania vaccine or skin test, or recombinant
        human interleukin-12.

        No use of an investigational drug or any vaccine other than the study vaccine within 30
        days preceding the dose, or planned use during the study period.

        No administration of chronic immunosuppressants (defined as more than 14 days) or other
        immune-modifying drugs within six months of vaccination. (For corticosteroids, this will
        mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids
        are allowed.)

        No history of prior leishmaniasis or of extensive travel to regions endemic for
        leishmaniasis, such as southern Mexico, Central and most of South America, the
        Mediterranean region and Middle East, Africa, and India.

        No confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

        No family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

        No history of significant allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any
        component.

        No acute disease at the time of enrollment, defined as the presence of a moderate or severe
        illness with or without fever.

        No acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
        function abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

        No pregnant or lactating females.

        Must not have suspected or known alcohol or drug abuse.

        No other significant finding that, in the opinion of the investigator, would increase the
        risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in this study.
