      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine dietary macronutrient intake in children with Rett syndrome and in
      healthy controls.

      II. Measure sleeping and awake metabolic rates in various positions, i.e., reclining,
      sitting, and standing, by whole-room indirect calorimetry and isotope dilution.

      III. Quantify activity patterns by time-motion studies using 24-hour activity records and
      12-hour videotaping.

      IV. Correlate 24-hour activity patterns with 24-hour heart rate telemetry and short-term
      oxygen consumption.

      V. Estimate 24-hour fecal and urinary energy losses. VI. Determine body composition by
      clinical anthropometry, whole-body potassium counting, and total-body electrical conductance.

      VII. Calculate apparent energy needs based on measurement of energy intake and expenditure.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      All participants undergo extensive nutritional and metabolic assessment with body composition
      evaluation. Studies include macronutrient intake, body fat, lean muscle mass, metabolic rate,
      and time-action studies; and 24-hour cardiac telemetry. Rett syndrome girls also receive a
      hemogram and hand x-ray.
