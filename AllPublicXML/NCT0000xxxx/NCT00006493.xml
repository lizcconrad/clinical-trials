  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of rosiglitazone, a drug usually taken
      for Type II diabetes, on HIV-associated hyperlipidemia. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a
      medical condition characterized by gradual changes in the distribution of body fat. The body
      fat located in the extremities and face disappears while body fat around the abdomen and
      upper back increases. Certain biochemical changes occur in association with these changes in
      fat distribution. Lipid levels particularly serum triglycerides are increased. HDL, the &quot;good
      cholesterol&quot; is decreased. Higher than normal level of insulin or insulin resistance is also
      found in this condition. This latter condition is one of the hallmarks of Type II diabetes.
      The protease inhibitors, a class of HIV medications, are associated with the occurrence of
      HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It has been suggested that a biochemical pathway known as the
      peripheral peroxisomal activating receptor (PPAR) gamma system is blocked leading to the
      onset of this condition.

      Rosiglitazone is a new drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of type II
      diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, which as mentioned before,
      is the hallmark of Type II diabetes. It has also been noted to improve blood lipid levels.
      Rosiglitazone works by stimulating the PPAR gamma system. It is hoped that this drug can turn
      on the PPAR system and reverse the HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome.
