      OBJECTIVES: I. Confirm the efficacy demonstrated in a pilot study using high dose
      cyclophosphamide in patients with severe aplastic anemia.

      II. Determine whether the addition of filgrastim (G-CSF) to high dose cyclophosphamide
      shortens the time to recovery in these patients.

      III. Determine whether this regimen is efficacious in treating paroxysmal nocturnal
      hemoglobinuria.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4. Beginning on
      day 10, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) until the absolute neutrophil count is greater
      than 1,000/mm3 for 2 consecutive days.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for at least 2 years and annually thereafter.
