  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that creates high quality images of the
      human body without the use of X-ray (radiation). MRI is especially useful when studying the
      brain, because it can provide information about certain brain functions. In addition, MRI is
      much better than standard X-rays at showing areas of the brain close to the skull and
      detecting changes in the brain associated with neurological diseases. In this study
      researchers will use MRI to gather information about the processes that control human
      movement and sensory processing.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate how the brain is activated when remembering,
      thinking, or recognizing objects. Researchers would like to determine what happens to brain
      functions when patients have trouble remembering, thinking, or recognizing objects following
      the start of disorders in the brain and nervous system. In addition, this study will
      investigate the processes of motor control in healthy volunteers and patients with disease.

      The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology
      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place
      during disease. Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during different
      tasks, either while making repetitive movements or undergoing sensory stimulation. These
      studies should provide new insight concerning the processes that control human movement and
      sensory processing. The studies described in this protocol will be conducted by systems
      operating on 1.5 Tesla up to 4 Tesla, including a system at 3 Tesla which is going to be
      installed in near future.
