      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radioactive drugs such as holmium Ho 166 DOTMP can kill cancer
      cells without harming healthy cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to
      replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melphalan with or without
      holmium Ho 166 DOTMP followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients
      who have multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of melphalan with or without holmium Ho 166 DOTMP
      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple
      myeloma. II. Compare the response rate and overall survival of these patients treated with
      these regimens. III. Compare the hematologic recovery rate and time to granulocyte
      engraftment of these patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the toxicity of these
      regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to their beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) test at initial diagnosis (B2M no greater than
      4 mg/L vs B2M greater than 4 mg/L vs unknown B2M). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Prior to stratification and randomization, patients receive a diagnostic dose
      of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP within days -31 to -10. Patients with adequate skeletal uptake of the
      diagnostic dose are randomized for therapy. Arm I: Patients receive holmium Ho 166 DOTMP IV
      over no more than 10 minutes within days -10 to -7 (at least 1 week and no more than 3 weeks
      after the diagnostic dose), melphalan IV over 20-30 minutes within days -3 to -1 (at least 24
      hours prior to autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation), and autologous
      PBSC transplantation on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive melphalan and autologous PBSC
      transplantation as in arm I. Following transplantation, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      daily until blood counts recover. Patients are followed at 1 year, every 6 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 9 months.
