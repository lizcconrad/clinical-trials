      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to daily oral dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo for 52 weeks.
      Patients are evaluated every 13 weeks on study and return for a follow-up 6 weeks after
      completion of therapy.

      Concurrent therapy with estrogen replacement and stable doses of prednisone, azathioprine,
      methotrexate (with folate supplementation), hydroxychloroquine, and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs is allowed. Other investigational medications and immunosuppressants
      are prohibited.
