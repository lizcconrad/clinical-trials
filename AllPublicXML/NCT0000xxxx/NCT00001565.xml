    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic trial. Patients receive phenylbutyrate through a central venous
      catheter for each 28 day cycle. The first several days of drug administration should be
      inpatient. Cycles may be repeated if there is no tumor progression or dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT). There are no breaks between cycles.

      Once a minimum of 3 patients have completed at least 4 weeks of therapy without DLT, new
      patients will be entered at the next dose level.

    <textblock>
      Phenylbutyrate is an aromatic fatty acid that is converted to phenylacetate in vivo by
      mitochondrial beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate. The objective of this trial is to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose and the toxicities of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion for 28 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of phenylbutyrate and its
      metabolite, phenylacetate, will be studied using both model-dependent and model-independent
      parameters.

        standard therapy.

        Patients with evidence of bone marrow involvement by tumor, or a history of either bone
        marrow transplantation or extensive radiotherapy will be eligible, but inevaluable for
        hematologic toxicities.

        Patients with greater than grade 2 neurocortical toxicity will be excluded.
