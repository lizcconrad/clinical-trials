    <textblock>
      This large randomized trial tested whether phenobarbital given to a pregnant woman about to
      deliver a premature infant would prevent brain injuries in their newborns. Women with 24 to
      32 week fetuses who were in preterm labor and were expected to deliver within 24 hrs were
      randomized to phenobarbital or usual care. They were treated until they deliver or the fetus
      reaches 33 wks gestation. Babies were followed until discharge and evaluated at 18-22 mos
      corrected age for neurodevelopmental outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of phenobarbital to pregnant women before delivery has been thought to
      decrease the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants. To evaluate this
      potential neuroprotective therapy further, we determined the effect of antenatal
      administration of phenobarbital on the frequency of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage and
      early death. Women who were 24 to 33 weeks pregnant and who were expected to deliver their
      infants within 24 hours were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous phenobarbital
      (10 mg/kg body weight) or placebo, followed by maintenance doses until delivery or 34 wks
      gestation. Infants less than 34 wks at birth underwent serial cranial ultrasonography to
      detect the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. The sample size of 1038 pregnancies was based
      on an intracranial hemorrhage rate of 20 percent in the placebo and less than 12 percent in
      the phenobarbital group; 90 percent power; a 5 percent two-tailed type 1 error; and an 8
      percent noncompliance rate. The twin with the highest grade of intracranial hemorrhage was
      included.

      Degree of maternal sedation was evaluated after administration of study drug. Neonatal
      ultrasound exams were performed at 3-5 days, 10-14 days, and 38-42 wks postmenstrual age;
      neonatal medications were recorded during the first week of life; treatments, and outcomes
      were recorded through death, discharge, or 120 days, whichever occurred first.
      Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 18-22 months corrected age by certified examiners
      masked to treatment status.
