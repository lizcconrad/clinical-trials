  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of fluconazole as an intravenous dose as initial
      treatment for acute cryptococcal meningitis followed by oral therapy in AIDS and non-AIDS
      patients. Both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients are eligible. The effectiveness of
      maintenance fluconazole therapy in sustaining a clinical cure in AIDS patients will also be
      evaluated.
