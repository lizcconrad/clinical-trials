      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 dosing schedules
      (once daily vs twice daily) of lamivudine (3TC) given with stavudine (d4T) and either
      indinavir (IDV) or nelfinavir (NFV) for 24 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 receives 3TC qd plus d4T plus either IDV or
      NFV. Group 2 receives 3TC bid plus d4T plus either IDV or NFV. Patients are evaluated for
      drug tolerance, medication adherence, and genotypic and phenotypic resistance.
