      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining peripheral stem cell transplantation with combinations of
      drugs may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation in
      women with stage II breast cancer with eight or more positive axillary lymph nodes and in
      women with stage III or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the curative potential of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide,
      and carboplatin followed by autologous stem cell rescue in women with breast cancer
      considered incurable by conventional therapy. II. Observe the overall response rate, survival
      rate, and toxicity associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Prior to therapy, patients undergo collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)
      on another protocol; patients with marrow involvement undergo PBSC harvest only, while all
      others may also undergo bone marrow harvest. All patients receive cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide, and carboplatin over 4 consecutive days, followed 3 days later by PBSC or bone
      marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Patients are followed for duration of
      remission and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 100-200 patients will be entered.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed invasive (stage II-IV) carcinoma of the
        breast 8 or more positive axillary nodes required for stage II disease
        Chemotherapy-responsive disease required of patients with measurable or evaluable disease
        Partial or complete response to 3 courses of standard
        cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF) or, for patients who have had CAF,
        cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) 3-month course of standard
        mitomycin/vinblastine or paclitaxel acceptable in patients clearly resistant to CAF or CMF
        Visceral response despite progression in bone will be considered on an individual basis
        Patients with no evidence of disease may be entered without evidence of a chemotherapy
        response Resectable disease must be surgically removed prior to transplantation Hormone
        receptor status: If estrogen-receptor positive, prior failure with at least 1 hormonal
        manipulation required unless patient is premenopausal or has rapidly progressing visceral
        disease No more than 20% of marrow involved with tumor

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 15 to 60 Sex: Women only Menopausal status: Not specified
        Performance status: Karnofsky 80%-100% Hematopoietic: WBC at least 4,000/mm3 Platelet count
        at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL AST less than 2 times normal
        Albumin at least 3.0 g/dL Renal: Creatinine less than 1.8 mg/dL BUN less than 20 mg/dL
        Cardiovascular: Left ventricular ejection fraction at least 55% Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, and
        FVC at least 50% of predicted pO2 at least 70 mm Hg on room air Other: No serious
        psychiatric, neurologic, or medical illness that would compromise the safety of a bone
        marrow transplant Effective contraception required of fertile women

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: See Disease
        Characteristics Endocrine therapy: See Disease Characteristics Radiotherapy: No prior chest
