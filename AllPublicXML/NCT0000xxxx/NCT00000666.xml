  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate pyrimethamine as a prophylactic agent against toxoplasmic encephalitis in
      individuals who are coinfected with HIV and latent Toxoplasma gondii.

      Toxoplasmic encephalitis is a major cause of illness and death in AIDS patients. Standard
      treatment for toxoplasmic encephalitis is to combine pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.
      Continuous treatment is necessary to prevent recurrence of the disease, but constant use of
      pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine is associated with toxicity. Clindamycin has been shown to be
      effective in treatment of toxoplasmic encephalitis in animal studies. This study evaluates
      pyrimethamine as a preventive treatment against toxoplasmic encephalitis (per 3/26/91
      amendment, clindamycin arm was discontinued).

      Patients are randomized to receive pyrimethamine or placebo three times a week. All patients
      must be on aerosolized pentamidine, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (T/S), or dapsone for
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis. Patients will be evaluated bi-weekly for the
      first month and every other month thereafter for at least 24 months.
