    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give an anti-HIV drug
      combination of indinavir (IDV) plus stavudine (d4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-infected
      children. IDV will be given either as a powder mixed into applesauce or as capsules given on
      an empty stomach.

      In this multicenter, open-label study patients receive a combined drug regimen of indinavir,
      stavudine, and lamivudine over 48 weeks. Patients are evaluated at Weeks 0, 2, 4, every 4
      weeks until Week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter until study completion. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      4/27/99: The study has been extended for an additional 48 weeks for a total of 96 weeks.]
