      To evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and clarithromycin,
      and to determine the effects of nevirapine on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity in vivo.

    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in two separate groups. Patients in Group I receive clarithromycin
      orally for 32 days and nevirapine orally for 28 days.

      Patients in Group II receive erythromycin intravenously on days 0, 14, 28, and 43 and
      nevirapine orally for 28 days.
