  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical, immunologic, and virologic effects of oral zidovudine (AZT) plus
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) versus AZT plus placebo (albumin). It is estimated that by
      1991, there may be 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children in the United States. HIV infection
      in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor prognosis. Treatment
      with antiviral therapy may be effective in changing the course of disease and decreasing
      mortality in this vulnerable population. AZT treatment has been shown to decrease mortality
      and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult AIDS patients; therefore, it
      is likely that children may also benefit from this antiviral therapy. In addition, bacterial
      infections are frequently found in HIV-infected children. Because pooled human serum
      immunoglobulin, another name for antibodies, is effective in reducing bacterial infection in
      patients with defects of immunity, it may reduce the rate of bacterial infection in
      HIV-infected children as well. In this study, AZT will be administered together with IVIG to
      determine safety, tolerance, and efficacy of the combined treatment.

      together with IVIG to determine safety, tolerance, and efficacy of the combined treatment.

      The study includes 250 children, 3 months to 12 years of age. All participants receive oral
      AZT. IVIG or intravenous placebo is administered every 28 days. Patients are followed for the
      development of serious bacterial infection, as well as for a number of factors relating to
      safety, tolerance, progression of disease, and survival. This is an outpatient study
      conducted over a minimum 100-week period. The children are evaluated every 2 weeks for the
      first 8 weeks, and monthly thereafter.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Benadryl and/or acetaminophen may be given before and during intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion in patients demonstrating mild reactions during
             infusion.

          -  Acetaminophen for short-term fever and pain.

          -  Zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Steroids.

          -  Oral or systemic (swish and swallow) nystatin.

          -  Maintenance therapy for fungal disease or tuberculosis.

          -  Prophylaxis for a previous episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) including
             the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX). The dosage is specified as TMP
             75 mg/m2 twice daily 3 times a week and SMX 375 mg/m2 twice daily 3 times a week.

          -  Recommended:

          -  Children with AIDS and / or CD4 count = or &lt; 500 cells/mm3 should receive primary PCP
             prophylaxis as described.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Blood transfusion for hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl and hematocrit &lt; 24 percent or bone marrow
             suppression.
