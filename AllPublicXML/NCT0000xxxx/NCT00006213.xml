    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-214662 in treating patients
      who have acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of BMS-214662 in patients
      with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase.

      II. Determine any preliminary evidence of antileukemia activity of this drug in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4
      weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
