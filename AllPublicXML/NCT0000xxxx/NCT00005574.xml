      This study will evaluate the antibiotic gentamicin for treating patients with muscular
      dystrophy caused by a specific genetic abnormality known as a nonsense mutation. In studies
      of mice with this type of muscular dystrophy, gentamicin treatment produced positive changes
      in muscle tissue.

      Patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations by may be
      eligible for this 2-week study. Before starting treatment, patients will have evaluations of
      muscle strength and general well being. Two muscle tissue samples will be taken by needle
      biopsy, under local anesthetic and sedation. Because of potential risks of hearing loss and
      kidney toxicity associated with gentamicin, patients will also have a hearing test and blood
      and urine tests for kidney function before starting treatment. (Currently, gentamicin is
      commonly prescribed for serious infections of the lungs, heart, and digestive and urinary
      tracts; adverse effects of hearing loss and kidney toxicity can occur with excessively high
      drug doses.)

      Patients will be hospitalized during drug treatment. Gentamicin will be given intravenously
      (through a vein) once a day for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected daily to monitor
      drug levels and determine dosage adjustments, if necessary. Urine samples will be collected
      to assess kidney function. Hearing tests will be done on days 7 and 10.

      On the last day of the study, hearing, kidney function, and muscle strength will be tested
      and the results compared with pre-treatment levels. Blood and muscle samples will also be
      taken again for pre-treatment comparison. Hearing, blood, urine, and muscle strength tests
      will be repeated one month after treatment ends for comparison with previous results.

    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal disease of progressive muscular weakness for
      which there is currently no effective treatment. The disease is caused by mutations in the
      gene for dystrophin. A subset of these mutations includes nonsense mutations, i.e., premature
      stop codons. Previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides are effective in allowing
      translation through stop codons. Recently, gentamicin was shown to restore functional
      dystrophin in a mouse model of DMD. The objective of this protocol is to determine if
      gentamicin is also an effective treatment in patients with DMD caused by nonsense mutations.
      This will be a preliminary, non-blinded study in which levels of intravenous gentamicin
      previously established to be safe, will be administered to identified patients meeting
      inclusion criteria over a two-week period. These patients will have CLIA approved laboratory
      documented stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene. Quantitative dystrophin expression
      will be the primary outcome. Strength measurements will also be assessed before and
      immediately after the two-week treatment period. Follow-up evaluations will be made at one
      month. For this subset of patients with DMD it is anticipated that there will be a transient
      increase in dystrophin expression with a possible corresponding transient improvement in
      strength. Subsequent blinded studies to evaluate the most effective dose and dosing intervals
      would then be pursued.
