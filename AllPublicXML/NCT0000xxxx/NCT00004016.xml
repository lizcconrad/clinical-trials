      RATIONALE: Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be an
      effective treatment for melanoma and solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interferon gamma in treating patients
      with recurrent or metastatic melanoma or other solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral adenovirus vector
      containing interferon gamma in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma or
      other solid tumors. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient
      population. III. Determine the local or distant antitumor effect of this regimen in these
      patients. IV. Evaluate the biological and immunological effects of this regimen and the
      extent of local interferon gamma expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive adenovirus interferon gamma
      intratumorally on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients achieving tumoral response may receive
      additional courses of therapy at the discretion of the investigator. Cohorts of at least 3
      patients receive escalating doses of adenovirus interferon gamma until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 weeks after
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
