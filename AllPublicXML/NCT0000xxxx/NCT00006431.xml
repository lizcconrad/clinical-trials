  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and dose-limiting toxicity of administering escalating doses of dendritic
      cells transfected with autologous renal cell carcinoma RNA DC(DCRCC-RNA) will be defined. As
      a secondary endpoint, the ability of DCRCC-RNA to induce tumor-specific immune responses will
      be evaluated. Finally, the anti-tumor effects measured by clinical response criteria, their
      duration and overall survival (calculated at 2-year follow-up) will be determined in each
      patient receiving dendritic cell therapy.

      Background: Prognosis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma is poor with a median survival of
      less than one year. Although renal cell carcinoma has shown some response to immunotherapy,
      the results of systemic administration of biologic response modifiers in disseminated renal
      cell carcinoma have been poor. Growing evidence suggests that active immunotherapy,
      particularly dendritic cells (DC) based vaccines, may prove to be a viable and clinically
      effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Methods: This study will enroll patients with renal cell carcinoma Stage III (T3 N1 M0) or
      Stage IV (T4 N0 N1 M0 - any T N2 M0 - any T any N M1) after nephrectomy. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells collected through leukapheresis are processed for DC generation.
      Mononuclear cells are separated and cultured for 7 days in GM-CSF and IL-4. Harvested DC will
      be pulsed with renal tumor RNA harvested during nephrectomy. An aliquot of these cells will
      be tested for appropriate phenotype fungal and bacterial sterility as well as for endotoxin
      content prior to lot release. Renal tumor RNA transfected DC will be stored cryopreserved
      until administration.

      The first 3 patients will be enrolled at a low dose and monitored for dose limiting
      toxicities. If no dose limiting toxicities are seen, the next 3 patients will be enrolled at
      the medium dose. If no dose limiting toxicities are seen in the medium dose, 6 additional
      patients will be enrolled on the high dose and will be evaluated for dose limiting
      toxicities. If in preparation of the vaccine insufficient RNA or dendritic cells are
      available to perform the required three injections at the assigned dose level or if the
      patient is withdrawn from the study the treatment position will remain open, i.e., no dose
      fractions will be given. Patients in whom only the minimum number of DCRCC-RNA can be
      produced to deliver one I.V. and one I.D. injection will be able to receive the vaccine, even
      if he or she is assigned to a higher dose level, but will be replaced in order to assess
      toxicity.

      Data Analysis 1. To determine the short and long term toxicities associated with
      administration of DCRCC-RNA in patients with metastatic RCC. 2. To determine feasibility of
      DC vaccine generation according to the proportion of patients for whom sufficient cells are
      generated to provide treatment. 3. To determine the cellular immune response to
      administration of DCRCC-RNA. 4. To measure the clinical responses mediated by administration
      of DCRCC-RNA.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic RCC following resection of the primary renal tumor
             (Pathologic diagnosis and staging of the disease will be completed at time of
             surgery).

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 or 1 according the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria and must have an estimated life expectancy of 6 months
             and more.

          -  Patients must not have undergone any major surgery during the past 6 weeks. In
             addition no chemotherapeutic agents, (standard or experimental) radiation therapy,
             (local therapy or palliative treatment for painful bony metastases) or immunotherapy
             (i.e. IL-2, interferon-alpha, ALT therapy) can be administered 6 weeks prior to
             enrollment. Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from prior
             treatment.

          -  Adequate hematologic function with: WBC 3000 mm3, hemoglobin 9 mg/dl, platelets
             100,000/mm3

          -  Patients may be transfused to meet the eligibility criteria.

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function with: serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl, bilirubin &lt;
             2.0 mg/dl

          -  Adequate coagulation parameters with: Partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.5 x control

          -  Ability to understand and provide signed inform consent that fulfills Institutional
             Review Board guidelines

          -  Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate follow-up as required
             by this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant and nursing women are excluded.

          -  Patients after radical nephrectomy are excluded since no tumor tissue can be retrieved
             and no vaccine generated.

          -  Patients with either previously irradiated or new CNS (central nervous system)
             metastases as determined by enhanced cranial CT or MRI prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis.

          -  Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness such as pulmonary (asthma
             or COPD) or cardiac (NYHA class III or IV) or hepatic disease or other illness
             considered by the P.I. to constitute an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug
             treatment.

          -  Medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the protocol.

          -  Patients with prior history of another malignancy within the last 5 years (excluding

             infection, HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot), viral hepatitis
             (as determined by HBsAg and Hepatitis C serology) and surgical site infection
             following nephrectomy. Any postoperative complication rendering experimental therapy
             unduly hazardous i.e. deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism will exclude
             eligibility from study.

          -  Patients on steroid therapy (or other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or
             cyclosporine A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients
             must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with serum calcium &gt;12 mg/dl or symptomatic hypercalcemia. Documented active
             treatment for hypercalcemia is allowed.

          -  Patients with inadequate peripheral vein access to perform leukapheresis.
