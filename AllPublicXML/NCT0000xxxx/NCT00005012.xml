  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective to give PEG-Intron (PEG-IFN) to
      HIV-infected patients who are not doing well with their current anti-HIV drug combination
      (HAART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At entry, patients undergo HIV genotypic/phenotypic analysis. Patients continue their current
      antiretroviral regimen but are randomized to receive one of four doses of PEG-IFN or PEG-IFN
      placebo administered subcutaneously once per week until results of HIV genotyping/phenotyping
      are available (approximately 4 weeks). Patients who respond with a 0.5 log or greater
      decrease in HIV RNA at Week 4 have optimized HAART added to their ongoing PEG-IFN regimen and
      are followed for 24 weeks in an observational study.
