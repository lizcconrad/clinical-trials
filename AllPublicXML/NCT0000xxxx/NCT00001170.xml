  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is the continuation of a study started more than 20 years ago. The study
      was designed to explore the effect that depressed parents have on their children and to
      better understand the factors that contribute to depression development and maintenance.

      The study will continue to investigate if children have certain characteristics in early and
      middle childhood that predict the later development of psychological disorders.

      In addition, the study will continue looking at the processes responsible for the development
      of children of parents with and without affective (mood) disorders.

      The psychological development of offspring of parents with and without affective disorder is
      assessed from early childhood to young adulthood. Parents with a diagnosis of major
      depression or bipolar illness and well parents and their children are studied (SADS-L, RDC,
      and SCID, DSM-III). A sibling pair is studied in each family. Parent-child interaction is
      investigated through direct observation of behavior in naturalistic and controlled settings.
      Family history information is obtained through parent interviews. Behavioral observations,
      standard tests, physical examinations, and psychiatric interviews, and MRI procedures provide
      multiple assessments of the offspring. The study has been completed through preadolescence,
      adolescence, and late adolescence. Follow-up in young adulthood continues.
