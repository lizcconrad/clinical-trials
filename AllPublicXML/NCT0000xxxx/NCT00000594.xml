  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether lowering of cholesterol with cholestyramine in a population with Type II
      hyperlipidemia led to a decreased rate of progression (a regression of coronary artery
      disease) as demonstrated by death, myocardial infarction, or progression of disease on
      angiography.

      BACKGROUND:

      There is overwhelming evidence that increased cholesterol levels are associated with
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This study examined whether lowering of cholesterol
      through drug therapy in people who had coronary artery disease as determined by angiography
      led to regression of the disease, again as indicated by angiography and reduction in
      mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The study should be contrasted with the Coronary
      Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT), which determined whether lowering cholesterol through a
      combination of drug and diet therapy resulted in decreased cardiovascular mortality. It
      should be noted that patients in the CPPT did not have known preexisting coronary heart
      disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A randomized, double-blind trial, with single experimental and control groups. The
      experimental group received drug therapy (cholestyramine); the control group received
      placebo. Both groups received diet therapy. The endpoints were a significant difference in
      the progression of coronary disease as shown by angiography or a significant difference in
      new myocardial infarction or death. Patients were followed under therapy for at least 5
      years.
