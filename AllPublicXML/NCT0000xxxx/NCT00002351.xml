  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and plasma concentration profiles of indinavir sulfate
      ( MK-639; Crixivan ) in HIV-seropositive older children and adolescents. To compare the
      plasma concentration profile after the initial dose with data from a historical group of
      adults. To obtain preliminary data on antiviral activity of MK-639.
