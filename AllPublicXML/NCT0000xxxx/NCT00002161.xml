      To evaluate the anti-HIV activity, safety, and tolerance of adefovir dipivoxil ( bis-POM PMEA
      ) in combination with standard antiretroviral therapy for 48 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive either adefovir dipivoxil or placebo daily for 24 weeks,
      after which all patients will receive open-label drug for an additional 24 weeks. Study drug
      is administered in combination with a current antiretroviral regimen for the entire 48 weeks.
      Patients are followed every 4 weeks during the first 24 weeks of study, then every 8 weeks
      during the last 24 weeks.
