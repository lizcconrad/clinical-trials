  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 5-azacytidine and phenylbutyrate for
      treating thalassemia major. Patients with this disease have abnormal production of hemoglobin
      (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), which leads to red blood cell destruction.
      As a result, patients require frequent red cell transfusions over many years. Because of
      these transfusions, however, excess iron is deposited in various body organs-such as the
      heart, liver, thyroid gland and, in men, the testes-impairing their function.

      Fetal hemoglobin-a type of hemoglobin that is produced during fetal and infant life-can
      substitute for adult hemoglobin and increase the levels of red cells in the body. After
      infancy, however, this type of hemoglobin is no longer produced in large quantities.
      5-azacytidine can increase fetal hemoglobin levels, but this drug can damage DNA, which in
      turn can increase the risk of cancer. This study will try to lessen the harmful effects of
      5-azacytidine by using only one or two doses of it, followed by long-term therapy with
      phenylbutyrate, a drug that may be as effective as 5-azacytidine with less harmful side
      effects.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with severe thalassemia major may be eligible for this
      study. Before beginning treatment, candidates will have a medical history and physical
      examination, blood tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), bone marrow biopsy (removal
      of a small sample of bone marrow from the hip for microscopic examination) and whole-body
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the biopsy, the area of the hip is anesthetized and a
      special needle is inserted to draw bone marrow from the hipbone. For the MRI scan, a strong
      magnetic field is used to produce images that will identify sites where the body is making
      red blood cells. During this procedure, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder
      containing a magnetic field. Earplugs are placed in the ears to muffle the loud thumping
      sounds the machine makes when the magnetic fields are being switched.

      An intravenous (IV) catheter (flexible tube inserted into a vein) is placed in a large vein
      of the patient's neck, chest or arm for infusion of 5-azacytidine at a constant rate over 4
      days. Patients who do not respond to this first dose of 5-azacytidine will be given the drug
      again after about 50 days. If they do not respond to the second dose, alternate treatments
      will have to be considered. Patients who respond to 5-azacytidine will begin taking
      phenylbutyrate on the 14th day after 5-azacytidine was started. They will take about 10 large
      pills 3 times a day, continuing for as long as the treatment is beneficial. All patients will
      be hospitalized for at least 6 days starting with the beginning of 5-azacytidine therapy.
      Those who are well enough may then be discharged and continue treatment as an outpatient.

      Patients will be monitored with blood tests daily for 2 weeks and then will be seen weekly
      for about another 5 weeks. Bone marrow biopsies will be repeated 6 days after treatment
      begins and again at 2 weeks and 7 weeks. MRI will be repeated 7 weeks after treatment begins.
      After 7 weeks, patients will be seen at 3-month intervals. Bone marrow biopsies will be done
      every 6 months for the first 3 years after treatment. Patients will have red cell
      transfusions as needed and chelation therapy to remove excess iron.

      Individuals with homozygous beta-thalassemia are either severely anemic or dependent on blood
      transfusion to sustain life. Deficient synthesis of the beta chain leads to imbalanced chain
      synthesis with an excess of alpha globin. This alpha globin precipitates, causing ineffective
      erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. In patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia,
      enhanced gamma globin synthesis could partially compensate for the deficient synthesis of
      beta globin rendering chain synthesis more balanced and reducing the relative excess of alpha
      chains. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that induction therapy with
      5-azacytidine, followed by maintenance treatment with oral phenylbutyrate will enhance gamma
      globin synthesis, increase red cell production and partially or substantially correct the
      anemia in patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Thalassemia major with progressive disease or complications of iron overload despite
        traditional transfusion and iron chelation therapy

        Thalassemia major in which standard transfusion therapy or iron chelation therapy is
        contraindicated

        ECOG performance status must be less than or equal to 2

        NYHA less than or equal to class II status

        Progressive disease is defined as 1) an increasing transfusion requirement or difficulty in
        maintenance of hemoglobin levels greater than 7g/dl as a consequence of autologous or
        allogeneic antibodies or 2) increasing extramedullary hematopoiesis causing compression
        phenomena.

        Complications of iron overload despite iron chelation therapy is defined as difficulty in
        achieving negative iron balance when complications of iron overload exist. Complications of
        iron overload include heart failure, or decreased cardiac ejection fraction, endocrinopathy
        and evidence of progressive liver dysfunction.
