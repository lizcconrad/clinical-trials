      This multicenter clinical trial tested whether minimal ventilation decreases death or BPD.
      Infants with birth weight 501g to 1000g and mechanically ventilated before 12 hours were
      randomly assigned to minimal ventilation (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO(2)] target
      &gt;52 mm Hg) or routine ventilation (PCO(2) target &lt;48 mm Hg) and a tapered dexamethasone
      course or saline placebo for 10 days, using a 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary outcome was
      death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Blood gases, ventilator settings, and FiO2 were
      recorded for 10 days; complications and outcomes were monitored to discharge. The infants'
      neurodevelopment was evaluated at 18-22 months corrected age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lung disease (CLD), also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in very premature
      infants has been associated with mechanical ventilation and relative adrenal insufficiency.

      This multicenter clinical trial tested whether minimal ventilation decreases death or BPD.
      Infants with birth weight 501g to 1000g and mechanically ventilated before 12 hours were
      randomly assigned to minimal ventilation (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO(2)] target
      &gt;52 mm Hg) or routine ventilation (PCO(2) target &lt;48 mm Hg) and a tapered dexamethasone
      course or saline placebo for 10 days, using a 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary outcome was
      death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Blood gases, ventilator settings, and FiO2 were
      recorded for 10 days; complications and outcomes were monitored to discharge.

      The trial was terminated by the Steering Committee when the interim analysis for the Data
      Safety and Monitoring Committee showed a higher rate of spontaneous gastrointestinal
      perforations in the dexamethasone-treated infants.

      Neurodevelopment was assessed at 18-22 months postmenstrual age.

  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The trial was halted because of unanticipated nonrespiratory adverse events related to
    dexamethasone therapy.
