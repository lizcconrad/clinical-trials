      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to
      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and response to intensive chemotherapy followed by
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's disease or
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have received prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -9 to -6 and cyclophosphamide
      IV over 2 hours on days -5 to -2. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day
      0. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven Hodgkin's disease OR Histologically proven
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Intermediate grade OR Large cell immunoblastic (high grade)
        Refractory to standard therapy or relapsed following initial complete remission Must have
        received radiotherapy to the extent that no longer eligible for involved field radiation,
        cyclophosphamide, or total body irradiation No CNS disease A new classification scheme for
        adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or
        &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or
        &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.

        infarction in the last 3 months No significant arrhythmia requiring medication Pulmonary:
        No significant nonneoplastic pulmonary disease No chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
        Diffusing capacity at least 50% predicted OR FEV1 and/or FVC at least 75% predicted (unless
