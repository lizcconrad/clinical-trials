        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

        - Prophylaxis or treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) consisting of either
        trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, aerosolized pentamidine, pyrimethamine / sulfadoxine, or
        dapsone allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Any immediately life-threatening infection or medical condition present at the time of
             study entry.

          -  Any active opportunistic or other infection requiring chronic therapy at the time of
             study entry. Patients with PCP may be randomized to study medication following a
             minimum 7-day course of therapy resulting in stabilization of their disease. Patients
             with stabilized disease must have a fever &lt; 39 C for at least 48 hours, pO2 (on room
             air ) = or &gt; 60 mm, and an Arterial/alveolar gradient = or &lt; 30 mm.

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS Dementia Complex.

          -  Received more than 4 weeks of antiretroviral therapy or who previously discontinued
             antiretroviral therapy due to drug related toxicity.

          -  Diseases and conditions listed in Exclusion Co-existing Conditions.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Seropositive for HIV infection documented by any federally licensed ELISA and
             confirmed by Western blot.

          -  Advanced HIV disease or AIDS-related complex.

          -  Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  AIDS with malignant disease likely to require cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS Dementia Complex.

          -  Impaired renal function ( Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine
             = or &gt; 2 mg/dl).

          -  Impaired hepatic function ( ALT = or &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal).

          -  Fever &gt; 39 C at entry.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any other experimental therapy.

          -  Drugs which cause significant bone marrow suppression.

          -  Cytolytic chemotherapy.

          -  Drugs which cause significant nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiation therapy (with the exception of electron beam therapy to an area &lt; 100 cm2).

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry:

        - Any other experimental therapy. Drugs which cause significant bone marrow suppression.
        Cytolytic chemotherapy. Drugs which cause significant nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity.

        Excluded within 4 weeks of entry:

        - Immunomodulating agents, including pharmacological doses of steroids for more than 10
        days (except for management of severe PCP in which case duration should not exceed 21
        days). Interferon. Isoprinosine. IL-2.

        Excluded within 8 weeks of entry:

        Antiretroviral agents including:

        - Ribavirin. Dideoxycytidine (ddC). Dideoxyadenosine (ddA). Didanosine (ddI). Foscarnet.
        Dextran Sulfate. AL-721. Retrovir (Zidovudine, AZT) for greater than 4 weeks or within 90
        days of study entry, or patients who originally discontinued Retrovir due to drug-related
        toxicity. Drugs metabolized by hepatic glucuronidation may alter the metabolism of Retrovir
        and should not be used chronically.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiation therapy (with the exception of electron beam therapy to an area &lt; 100 cm2)
             within 2 weeks of study entry.

        Known active drug or alcohol abuse.
