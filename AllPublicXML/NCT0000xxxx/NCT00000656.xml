  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and to evaluate the anti-HIV effect of low-, moderate-, and high-dose
      schedules of zidovudine (AZT) plus didanosine (ddI) versus ddI alone in asymptomatic
      HIV-infected patients. Because of the failure with long-term (more than 1 year) use of,
      frequency of toxicity from, and drug resistance to AZT, drug combinations need to be
      developed to enable lower, less toxic doses of AZT to be used and to slow or prevent the
      development of resistance, while providing at least the same effectiveness.

      toxic doses of AZT to be used and to slow or prevent the development of resistance, while
      providing at least the same effectiveness.

      Enrollment during the first 8 weeks of the study is restricted to hemophiliacs and sexual
      partners of hemophiliacs with asymptomatic HIV disease. After the initial 8 weeks this
      restriction is lifted. Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms with dosing of
      AZT plus ddI or ddI alone.
