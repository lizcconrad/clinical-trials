      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy following
      surgery in treating patients with advanced bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of sequential dose intensive adjuvant
      systemic therapy consisting of gemcitabine, then doxorubin, followed by paclitaxel and
      cisplatin with filgrastim (granulocyte colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) for patients with
      completely resected, locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. II.
      Assess the disease free and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 for a total of 6
      doses. A 1 week rest period occurs after the third dose of gemcitabine. At least 14 days
      after the last dose of gemcitabine, during the ninth week, patients receive doxorubicin at 2
      week intervals (weeks 9, 11, 13, and 15) for a total of 4 doses. Filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each cycle
      of doxorubicin. At least 14 days after the last dose of doxorubicin, during week 17, patients
      receive the combination of paclitaxel IV (3 hour infusion) and cisplatin, at 2 week intervals
      (weeks 17, 19, 21, and 23) for a total of 4 doses. G-CSF is again administered on days 3-10
      of each of these cycles. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6
      months for the next 3 years, then annually until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 25-30 patients in 1.5-2 years.
