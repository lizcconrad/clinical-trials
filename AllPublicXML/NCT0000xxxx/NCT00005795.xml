      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate of response (complete or partial remission), duration of
      response, relapse free survival, and overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or untreated older patients or those with secondary AML when
      treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Evaluate the toxicities of this agent in this patient
      population. III. Measure degree of apoptosis induced and/or differentiation in pretreatment
      and posttreatment AML cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for up to 60 days, or
      until bone marrow blasts are less than 5%, followed by 4-6 weeks of rest. After the first
      course, additional courses of arsenic trioxide last 25 days. Treatment continues for a
      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      with a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional 25 day course after achieving CR. Patients
      are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months,
      and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Documented acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) including secondary
        AML and biphenotypic leukemia Secondary AML may be either chemotherapy induced or evolving
        from a myelodysplastic syndrome Bone marrow evidence of AML must include the following:
        Cellularity of 20% or greater Minimum of 20% leukemic cells Signs of bone marrow failure

        than 1,500/mm3) Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3) Must not be any of
        the following: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia
        Acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) Prior induction therapy using any conventional induction
        chemotherapy regimen required In first or second relapse after successful induction therapy
        OR Failed 1 attempt at reinduction relapse OR Refractory to at least 1 prior induction
        therapy No prior induction therapy allowed in secondary AML or in newly diagnosed AML in
        patients at least 65 years old

        contraception No active infection and afebrile Afebrile, stable, and completing antibiotics
        allowed Febrile not from infection but from blood products allowed
