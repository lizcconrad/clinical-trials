      RATIONALE: Interferon-alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Giving
      interferon-alfa following chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be an
      effective treatment for Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b
      following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent
      or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa-2b in reducing the relapse rate in
      patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in second
      remission following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. II.
      Compare the time to disease progression and survival in this patient population treated with
      interferon alfa-2b vs no further treatment. III. Assess the tolerability of these treatment
      regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      lymphoma subtype. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive no further therapy following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
      transplantation. Arm II: Beginning 4 weeks after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem
      cell transplantation, patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously three times a week.
      Treatment continues for 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4-5 years.
