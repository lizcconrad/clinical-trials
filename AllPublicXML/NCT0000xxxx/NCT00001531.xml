  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the susceptibility of subjects to
      atherosclerosis is influenced by prior CMV exposure, whether the susceptability to
      endothelial dysfunction in patients with and in patients without atherosclerosis is
      influenced by prior CMV exposure.
