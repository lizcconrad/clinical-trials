      To administer colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced AIDS
      related complex (ARC) patients who have been receiving zidovudine (AZT) therapy, in order to
      obtain data on short-term effectiveness, safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and tolerance of
      combined treatment with the two drugs.

      Persons infected with HIV virus may undergo a long latency or persistent virus blood levels
      which may be present before any symptomatic illness. These individuals could, therefore,
      benefit from therapy with an effective antiretroviral agent. AZT, which is a powerful
      inhibitor of human retrovirus, has been approved for management of patients with symptomatic
      HIV infection. GM-CSF not only stimulates the bone marrow, it enhances the function of mature
      blood cells and has been found to enhance the ability of AZT to suppress HIV replication in
      vitro (test tube). Combination therapy with GM-CSF and AZT may lower complications as well as
      the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection.

      Colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is administered subcutaneously, once a day or every other
      day, for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced ARC patients who have been receiving and will continue
      to receive a constant dose of AZT. Treatment is on an outpatient basis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Modest doses of acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-prescription doses of ibuprofen may be
             used with caution for fever control and mild analgesia. Prolonged use more than 72
             hours is not advised without dose supervision.

        All patients should have a documented history of positive HIV antibody by ELISA test.
        Patients should qualify for zidovudine (AZT) treatment for the following reasons:

          -  Patients with a prior episode of cytologically confirmed Pneumocystis carinii
             pneumonia (PCP).

          -  Patients with a prior episode of any AIDS-defining opportunistic infection and less
             than 200 T4 cells.

          -  Patients with advanced ARC as defined by mucocutaneous candidiasis and/or unexplained
             weight loss and less than 200 T4 cells and fever more than 100 degrees F of more than
             3 weeks duration; clinical diagnosis of hairy leukoplakia; herpes zoster infection
             within 3 months of entry; or unexplained diarrhea.

          -  All patients must have received at least 8 weeks of AZT prior to enrollment and must
             not have required a dose adjustment for the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent statement.

        Required:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) for at least 8 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        The following patients will be excluded:

          -  Patients receiving zidovudine (AZT) while enrolled in another protocol.

          -  Patients with other life-threatening and uncontrolled opportunistic infection.

          -  Patients with evidence of lymphoma or neoplasm other than indolent Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Dementia that would prevent giving appropriate informed consent.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Acetaminophen or products containing acetaminophen.

          -  Drugs that are nephrotoxic, are cytotoxic, or decrease blood cell number or function
             may increase the risk of toxicity.

        Probenecid may inhibit excretion of zidovudine (AZT). Some experimental nucleoside analogs
        should be avoided.

        The following patients will be excluded:

          -  Patients receiving zidovudine (AZT) while enrolled in another protocol.

          -  Patients with other life-threatening and uncontrolled opportunistic infection.

          -  Patients with evidence of lymphoma or neoplasm other than indolent Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Dementia that would prevent giving appropriate informed consent.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 8 weeks of study entry:

          -  Prior systemic therapy with an antimetabolite, cytotoxic drug, interferon,
             immunomodulator, corticosteroid, or nucleoside analog other than zidovudine.
