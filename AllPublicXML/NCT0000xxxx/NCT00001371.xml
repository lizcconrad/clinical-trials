  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot trial designed to evaluate topical antiflammin-2, a phospholipase A2
      (PLA2) inhibitor, in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Antiflammin-2 in an ointment
      base, or the vehicle alone will each be applied four times per day to a single plaque in a
      randomized, double-blinded fashion.
