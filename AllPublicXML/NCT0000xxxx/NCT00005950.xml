    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have recurrent
      or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or T-cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of
      patients with recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma when treated with 506U78.

      II. Assess the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or
             peripheral T-cell lymphoma

               -  Indolent B-cell lymphoma will include Waldenström's macroglobulinemia,
                  lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma,
                  and follicular small cleaved-cell or mixed cell lymphoma; patients with prior or
                  concurrent evidence of transformation to large cell lymphoma or with follicular
                  large cell lymphoma are ineligible

               -  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma will include all entities described in the REAL
                  classification; patients with B-cell ALCL are ineligible; patients with cutaneous
                  T-cell lymphoma and all its variants and/or histologic transformation of
                  cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are not eligible for this protocol, because they will
                  be instead eligible for a separate protocol

               -  Relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphomas include all those achieving and maintaining
                  a complete or partial response during initial therapy; refractory includes those
                  achieving all other responses during initial therapy; since the response rate of
                  indolent B-cell lymphomas to up-front therapy exceeds 90% this distinction is not
                  meaningful there

          -  No more than 2 prior chemotherapy and one prior immunotherapy regimens; if
             chemoimmunotherapy was used, the limit will be 3 prior regimens

          -  Performance status =&lt; 2 Zubrod

          -  Staging work-up within 3 weeks and bidimensionally measurable disease

          -  No anti-cancer treatment within the past three weeks

          -  ANC &gt;= 1,000/ul; may be included if in the judgment of the study chairman lower counts
             are explained by marrow or splenic involvement by lymphoma

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul; may be included if in the judgment of the study chairman
             lower counts are explained by marrow or splenic involvement by lymphoma

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x normal

          -  SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x normal values

          -  Estimated endogenous creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  HIV negative; the patients are excluded because the expected opportunistic infections
             will render study toxicity difficult to interpret; in addition the possible effects of
             506U78 on CD4 cells may be dangerous to these patients; furthermore, indolent B-cell
             lymphomas and aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas are extremely rare in the setting
             of HIV infection

          -  No active CNS disease

          -  No other malignancy within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             or in-situ cervical carcinoma treated with curative intent

          -  Females must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must be practicing adequate
             contraception; this is because 506U78 may be harmful to the developing fetus and
             nursing newborn or infant

          -  No preexisting sensory or motor neuropathy of grade ≥ 2, no history of seizures

          -  No prior stem cell or bone marrow transplantation; no prior 506U78

          -  All patients, including women or members of a minority that fulfill criteria for study
             entry will be eligible for treatment; no one fulfilling all these criteria for entry
             will be denied treatment solely on the basis of sex or minority status

          -  Patients with medical, psychiatric, or social conditions that make compliance with
             treatment or follow-up unlikely are not eligible

          -  No history of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction or pericardial effusion
