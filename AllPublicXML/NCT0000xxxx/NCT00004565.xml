      This study will explore whether different forms, or variants, of genes are related to a
      person s risk of developing breast cancer. The genes that are looked at have no clinical
      significance today, and thus will not impact your personal healthcare at this time. However,
      these results may help researchers better understand why some people develop breast cancer
      and others do not. The study will try to determine:

      if people with breast cancer have different gene variants from people without the disease;

      if these genetic differences influence a person s susceptibility to breast cancer when they
      are exposed to certain environmental substances, such as nicotine and estrogen; and

      if breast cancer that occurs in families is related to a grouping of these variants.

      The study will also look for certain proteins, cells, or other substances in fluid aspirated
      (by the use of gentle suction; no needles) from the nipple that might represent a pattern, or
      &quot;fingerprint,&quot; indicating increased risk for breast cancer.

      Study participants will complete questionnaires on cancer risk factors, diet, and family
      history. A small blood sample (3 tablespoons) will be drawn for study of genetic differences
      between people with breast cancer and people who are cancer-free. Nipple aspirations, a
      noninvasive method to obtain fluid from a women s breast, will be attempted 4 to 6 times,
      over a 4 6 week period. For this procedure, the subject places a warm moist towel over the
      breasts for about 20 minutes. The breasts are then cleansed with a rubbing alcohol pad. The
      subject compresses the breast with both hands and a small plastic cup is inverted over the
      breast. Suction is applied to a small syringe (no needles) attached to the cup for about 15
      seconds. The procedure may be repeated up to 5 times on each breast. Any drops of fluid
      obtained from the nipple will be collected in a glass tube.

    <textblock>
      Cancer risk, even among those with similar environmental exposures is not uniformly
      distributed. Although we have been able to identify genetic factors whose variants appear to
      significantly alter an individual's risk of developing breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2), these
      genes are likely involved with less than 10% of breast cancer cases. Perhaps more applicable
      to the general population are genes which, while not directly involved with the oncogenic
      process, may have variants (polymorphisms) which act indirectly by increasing the risk of an
      oncogenic change within a cell.

      It is the goal of this proposal to look at genes, environment, clinical co-factors, and, if
      possible, any interactions in breast cancer. The ultimate objective of these studies is to
      establish an effective way of identifying individuals at greatest risk for cancer. We will
      evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in
      estrogen metabolism and action. We will also evaluate the association of breast density and
      polymorphisms in genes associated with estrogen metabolism and action. In addition, we will
      also evaluate nipple aspirate fluid and breast duct lavage fluid as another potential source
      of promising biomarkers of risk.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Case Populations:

        Individuals with breast cancer are being ascertained from among the patient population at
        National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) as well as other referring institutions. Individuals
        from the Clinical Center may also be eligible. There will be three groups of participants,
        which include a control group, individuals with a documented history of breast cancer, and
        individuals identified to be at high risk of developing breast cancer. The purpose of the
        high risk group is to look for potential similarities and differences between the cancer
        and control populations that may start to be exhibited in the high risk group. This will
        potentially allow the research team to identify high risk women by markers of risk. After
        providing informed consent, individuals are asked to donate a blood sample, undergo nipple
        fluid sampling, and complete epidemiological, dietary and family history questionnaires and
        grant access to their medical records. The questionnaires will be completed and/or reviewed
        by the research team.

          1. . Individuals with a documented history of invasive breast cancer.

          2. . Individuals with a documented history of ductal carcinoma in situ.

        Control and High Risk Populations:

        We will use two primary methods for establishing risk status in individuals who are not
        affected with cancer.

          1. . Individuals found to harbor a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face up to a 50-85 percent
             lifetime risk for developing breast cancer as well as an increased risk for ovarian
             and other cancers that vary dependent on the gene involved. Therefore, individuals
             with a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will be assigned to the high risk population
             group.

          2. . For all participants without a history of breast cancer and no documented BRCA1 or
             BRCA2 mutation, the computerized Pedigree Assessment Tool (PAT) will be used to
             establish control or high risk group assignment. The PAT is capable of identifying
             women from families with features suggesting transmission of an autosomal dominant
             breast cancer susceptibility allele. The PAT is a simple point scoring system which
             assigns point values for each case of breast or ovarian cancer within a family.

        Pedigree Assessment Tool Scoring System

        Diagnosis Points Assigned

        Breast Cancer at age 50 or higher 3 Breast cancer prior to age 50 4

        Ovarian Cancer at any age 5

        Male Breast Cancer at any age 8

        Ashkenazi Jewish heritage 4

        The PAT score is calculated by adding the points assigned to every family member with a
        breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis, including 2nd and 3rd degree relatives. A separate
        score is calculated for both the maternal and paternal lineage and the higher of the 2
        scores is assigned to the participant. Validation data from this model demonstrate that the
        PAT score was more accurate than the modified Gail model at identifying women with a
        hereditary risk of breast cancer. Area under the ROC curve for the PAT was 0.9625 compared
        to 0.389 and 0.5861 for 5-year and lifetime Gail estimates respectively. a PAT score of
        greater than or equal to 8 provided the most accurate discrimination between &quot;high risk&quot;
        and &quot;not high risk&quot; women with a sensitivity of 100 percent specificity of 93 positive
        predictive value of 63 percent and negative predictive value of 100 percent.

        Control Populations:

        The control participants have been ascertained from among the low risk screening
        population, and from non-cancer clinics and practices of the NNMC and must meet both of the
        following criteria.

          1. Individuals with no prior history of any malignancy excluding skin cancers (except
             melanoma) and cervical cancer in situ.

          2. A PAT score less than 8.

          3. Gail risk less than 1.67.

        High Risk Population:

        In order for individuals to be in the high-risk for breast cancer group a subject must
        satisfy criterion 1 AND at least one of criteria 2 through 6.

          1. Have no prior history of any malignancy excluding skin cancers (except melanoma) and
             cervical cancer in situ.

          2. Gail Model - an estimated risk of greater than 1.66 of developing breast cancer over
             the next five years.

          3. A documented deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

          4. A PAT score greater than or equal to 8 .

          5. History of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).

          6. History of atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inability to give informed consent.

        Individuals with any active infection or superficial inflammation of the breast, or who are
        currently lactating or who are less than 6 months post-lactation will not be eligible to
        undergo nipple fluid sampling, however they may still participate in the rest of the study.
