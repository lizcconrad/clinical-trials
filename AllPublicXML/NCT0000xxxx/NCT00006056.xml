      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in the treatment of patients with life threatening hemophagocytic disorders.

      II. Determine the rate of disease free survival, incidence of graft failure, and incidence of
      graft versus host disease in these patients after undergoing this treatment regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive oral busulfan twice a day on days -9 to -6;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2; etoposide IV over 4 hours on days -5 to -3;
      and anti-thymocyte globulin IV twice a day on days -2 and -1 and days 1 and 2. Patients
      undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
      administered subcutaneously beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.
      Patients receive graft versus host disease prophylaxis with methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
      and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1-4 hours (orally once the patients resumes eating) every 12
      hours (every 8 hours for pediatric patients) starting on or prior to day -3 and continuing up
      to 1 year.

      Patients are followed at days 28 and 100, at 6 months and 1 year, and then annually for 5
      years.
