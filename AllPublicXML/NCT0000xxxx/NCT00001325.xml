      This study is designed to use positron emission tomography to measure brain energy use.
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional activity
      of the brain. The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal processes of the brain
      (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without
      physical / structural damage to the brain.

      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar
      (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and
      water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain
      activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also.

      Researchers can label a sugar with a small radioactive molecule called FDG
      (fluorodeoxyglucose). As areas of the brain use more sugar the PET scan will detect the FDG
      and show the areas of the brain that are active. By using this technique researchers hope to
      answer the following questions;

      4. Are changes in brain energy use (metabolism) present early in the course of epilepsy

      5. Do changes in brain metabolism match the severity of patient's seizures

      6. Do changes in metabolism occur over time or in response to drug therapy

      We propose to study children with recent onset partial epilepsy, cryptogenic infantile
      spasms, and idiopathic Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome with serial FDG-PET to elucidate the natural
      history and evolution of metabolic abnormalities associated with such epilepsies. The
      severity of the seizure disorder, and cognitive impairment, when present, will be correlated
      with the presence and extent of focal and global cerebral metabolic abnormalities.
