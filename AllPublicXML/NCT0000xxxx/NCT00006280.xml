  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's primary goals are to test the safety and effectiveness of Tobramycin for
      Inhalation (TOBIr) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who are between 6 months and 6 years of
      age. This drug is an antibiotic that is inhaled into the lungs by the patient. It has already
      been studied and approved by the FDA for treatment of CF patients 6 years and older. Lung
      fluid will be examined for bacteria before and after the 28-day treatment. The amount of
      bacteria before and after treatment will be compared. This will indicate whether the
      antibiotic was effective in killing bacteria in the lungs. Once treatment begins, patients
      will be monitored every 2 weeks throughout the study (5 exams in 56 days). Half of the
      patients will receive TOBIr, half will receive a placebo (a substance that looks like TOBIr
      but contains no medication).
