      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to receive antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone or placebo.

      Patients receive thyrotropin-releasing hormone or placebo intravenously over 20 minutes every
      8 hours for 4 doses.

      Infants are assessed for survival and chronic lung disease until day 28 after birth, and
      again at 36 postmenstrual weeks.
