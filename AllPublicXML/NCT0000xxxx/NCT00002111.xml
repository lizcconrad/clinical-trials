  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the toxicity, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected
      patients receiving 16 weeks of oral saquinavir mesylate ( Ro 31-8959 ) at one of two doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts of 16 patients receive 1 of 2 doses of Ro 31-8959 for 20 weeks. Administration of the
      higher dose will proceed only after 2-week safety data for the first eight patients on the
      lower dose has been reviewed.
