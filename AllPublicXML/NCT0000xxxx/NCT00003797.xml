      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine and trastuzumab in treating
      patients who have metastatic cancer of the pancreas that overexpresses HER2/neu.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
           and overexpression of HER2/neu treated with gemcitabine and trastuzumab.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly during weeks 1-7. Patients
      receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes once during week 1 and trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes once weekly during weeks 2-8.

      Patients with stable or responding disease receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly
      during weeks 1-3 and trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes once weekly during weeks 1-4. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 41 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24 months.
