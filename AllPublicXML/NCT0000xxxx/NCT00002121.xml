      To perform preliminary clinical testing of diethylhomospermine (DEHSPM), a polyamine
      analogue, for refractory AIDS-related diarrhea.

      Possibly, DEHSPM will reduce stool volume and frequency in patients with refractory
      AIDS-related diarrhea.

      Possibly, DEHSPM will reduce stool volume and frequency in patients with refractory
      AIDS-related diarrhea.

      Patients are initially hydrated for 24 hours, followed by a 3-day baseline period. They then
      receive intravenous infusions of DEHSPM three times per day for 3 days, followed by
      observation for 3 days.
