    <textblock>
      Deficient or inappropriate healing of bone impacts clinical decision-making and treatment
      options in orthopedics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery and periodontics.
      While a number of auto- and allografting techniques have been used to regenerate craniofacial
      defects caused by infective, neoplastic or trauma-induced bone loss, each method has
      significant limitations. Our research group in the Craniofacial and Skeletal Diseases Branch
      of NIDCR has developed methods to culture and expand cell populations derived from mouse bone
      marrow stroma. We believe that an important next step is to apply the information gained in
      animal studies to treat osseous defects in humans. We propose to examine the potential of
      cultured human bone marrow stromal cells to serve as an abundant source of osteoblastic
      progenitor cells. These cells will ultimately be used to graft craniofacial osseous defects.
      In the course of this study we will: (1) develop methods for the propagation and enrichment
      of osteoblastic progenitor cells from bone marrow stroma; (2) test various vehicles for the
      transfer of bone marrow stromal cells to osseous defects in recipient animals; (3) determine
      optimal culturing and transplantation conditions for the eventual transplantation of bone
      marrow stromal cells into human recipients. These studies will define the parameters of bone
      marrow stromal cell transplantation and will generate models for future therapeutic
      strategies.
