      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of infusing a chemical called muscimol
      into the brain to control seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy (frequent seizures
      that persist despite therapy). Muscimol, which is similar to a naturally occurring brain
      chemical called GABA, has been shown to reduce seizures in rats. After the infusion study,
      patients will undergo a standard surgical procedure for controlling seizures.

      Patients 18 years of age or older with intractable epilepsy may be eligible for this study.
      Before entering protocol 00-N-0158, candidates will be screened under protocol 01-N-0139,
      Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Epilepsy, with a medical history, physical and
      neurologic examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests,
      electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.

      Patients enrolled in this study will have the following procedures:

        1. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to guide
           catheter/electrode placement (see #2).

        2. Depth catheter/electrode placement into the presumed location of the seizure focus (the
           part of the brain where the seizures originate) - A small hole is drilled through the
           skull. A depth electrode with a hole in the center of the tubing is passed through the
           brain into the structures usually involved in intractable epilepsy. MRI will be done to
           check electrode placement. Video-EEG monitoring will continue for 5 days for this part
           of the study. Patients will be tested for their ability to understand and produce
           speech, see normally, move their arms and legs, distinguish sharp and dull objects, and
           put pegs in a pegboard. They will be questioned about headache, weakness, numbness or
           sleepiness. The electrode will be left in place for muscimol infusion (see #3).

        3. Muscimol infusion - Into the seizure focus, patients will be given two infusions-one of
           saline (salt water) alone and one of muscimol diluted in saline. Each infusion will be
           given over a period of one-half to 5 1/2 days, infused at the rate of 0.1 ml (1/50th of
           a teaspoon) per hour. During the infusions video-EEG recordings will continue and
           patients will be interviewed and examined as described in #2 above).

        4. Blood testing - About 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn daily during the testing
           period and for the first 2 days after surgery (see #5).

        5. Surgery - Temporal lobectomy or topectomy (removal of a small, specific area of brain
           tissue) is the standard surgical treatment for medically intractable epilepsy whose
           seizure focus is not in a critical brain region, such as an area that controls language,
           movement, or sensation. If the patient's seizures arise from one of these areas, an
           alternative procedure called multiple subpial transection will be offered. In this
           procedure, vertical cuts are made in the seizure focus to prevent neurons (nerve cells
           that transmit electrical impulses) in the focus from spreading the seizure to the rest
           of the brain.

        6. Surgery follow-up - Patients will be monitored in the surgical intensive care unit for
           24 to 48 hours and then in the NINDS nursing unit for 4 to 8 days before being
           discharged to home. Another visit in the NINDS outpatient clinic will be scheduled for
           6-12 weeks after surgery.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to test the hypotheses that direct infusion of
      the brain (convection enhanced delivery) with neurotransmitter receptor agonists is 1) safe
      and 2) can be used to study the basic pathophysiology of the epileptic focus in human
      subjects. The approach described may be a new approach for precise localization of a seizure
      focus. It may also prove to indicate the distribution of suppression (in space) required for
      elimination of seizure activity in individual patients and, by doing so, may more accurately
      define the minimum treatment area that is required for success. Finally, the data obtained
      may support the treatment of patients with medically intractable epilepsy with
      neurotransmitter-specific agents infused directly into the epileptic focus.

      Study Population: The study population will include adult patients with medically intractable
      epilepsy who are candidates for surgical resection of their epileptic region.

      Design: Adult patients who are candidates for standard surgical care for medically
      intractable epilepsy will undergo standard noninvasive evaluation to identify the location of
      the seizure focus. After surface EEG confirms the side and approximate location of the
      seizure focus, a depth electrode with a central lumen will be placed in the seizure focus for
      the purpose of this research study. The lumen in the depth electrode will be used to deliver
      vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) or muscimol, a neurotransmitter (gamma-aminobutyric
      acid, GABA) receptor agonist that suppresses neuronal activity. During the infusion trials,
      patients will be monitored by neurologic examination and by video-EEG. Following the trials,
      the epileptic focus will be resected, which is standard care for medically intractable
      epilepsy, and the surgical specimen will be examined for any histological changes caused by
      the infusions.

      Outcome Measures: Basic pathophysiology of the epileptic focus will be examined by assessing
      the effect of the infusion on seizure frequency (the primary end point), EEG recordings,
      motor function, and visual object naming. Safety will be assessed by neurologic examination
      and by pathologic examination (gross and microscopic) of the resected surgical specimen
      (presence or absence of infusion-induced injury).
