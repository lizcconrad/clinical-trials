      This study is for women who have already decided to undergo liposuction at Georgetown
      University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. To take part in this study, a woman must first
      meet with the plastic surgeons there, and be accepted by them to have liposuction. This study
      will investigate whether large volume liposuction improves risk factors for heart disease in
      overweight women with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated
      blood insulin levels. Large volume liposuction is the surgical removal of at least 10 pounds
      (4.5 kg) of body fat, usually from the abdomen, hips or chest. Risk factors for heart disease
      include high blood pressure and elevated levels of blood lipids (cholesterol and
      triglycerides), blood glucose (sugar), and blood insulin. Subjects who participate in all
      parts of this study will receive a total of $930.00.

      Overweight women 18 years or older with high blood insulin levels, impaired glucose
      tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, who are planning to have large volume liposuction performed at
      Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study. For
      a subject to be accepted into this study, she must first meet with the plastic surgeons at
      Georgetown University Medical Center, and they have to agree to perform large volume
      liposuction. The decision that someone is suitable for liposuction is not under the control
      of the NIH or of any NIH investigator.

      Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures at four separate times - before
      undergoing liposuction, 4 weeks after surgery, 4 months after surgery and 1 year after
      surgery:

        -  Body measurements - taken with calipers to measure several skinfold thicknesses (the
           width of a fat fold) and with a tape measure to measure the circumference of parts of
           the body.

        -  Urine sample and 6-hour urine collection - to test for pregnancy and to evaluate kidney
           function.

        -  Glucose tolerance test - measures insulin sensitivity and how the body uses sugar, how
           well insulin works, and insulin sensitivity. The procedure involves placement of two
           catheters (thin, flexible tubes) through a needle into a vein in each arm. Sugar water
           is infused into one catheter and 20 minutes into the test a small amount of insulin is
           injected. Blood samples are drawn from the other catheter at frequent intervals for a
           total of 5 hours.

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography - measure the heart's electrical activity
           and function.

        -  Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan - produces images for measuring body fat in
           the abdomen. (not done at the 4-week visit). Takes about half an hour to complete.

        -  DXA X-ray - measures body fat, muscle and bone mineral content. Takes about half an hour
           to complete.

        -  Bod Pod - capsule-like device used to determine the proportion of body weight composed
           of fat and non-fat tissue. Takes less than 10 minutes

        -  Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measures the proportions of body fat based on
           electrical conduction of a small electric current. Takes 2-3 minutes.

        -  24-hour blood pressure monitoring - a device attached to a blood pressure cuff strapped
           to the arm measures blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes continuously for 24 hours.

        -  Vascular reactivity tests - a blood pressure cuff is inflated for about 4 minutes before
           deflating, providing information on the function of the small blood vessels in the skin,
           as well as an idea of the function level of small blood vessels elsewhere in the body.
           Takes half an hour.

        -  Blood samples - collected to evaluate kidney and liver function and to measure body
           lipids, such as cholesterol, minerals, and other substances.

      Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often
      associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has
      been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that
      includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are
      racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with
      non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of
      overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.

      Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal
      (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding
      the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the
      limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that
      attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However,
      despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less
      visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent
      metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant
      role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated
      with obesity.

      With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial
      quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the
      complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but
      one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five
      African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume
      liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have
      hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the
      effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing
      studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume
      liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after
      liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function,
      dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles.

        Volunteers with uncontrolled, significant or evolving psychiatric/psychological syndromes
        which in the opinion of the investigators would place the patient at increased risk during
        the course of the study or would impede competence and/or ability to complete the study are
        not eligible.

        Volunteers with current history of illicit substance abuse and/or alcoholism based on
        reported history and the CAGE questionnaire are not eligible.
