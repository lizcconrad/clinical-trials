  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of combination anti-HIV drug
      therapy (with protease inhibitors [PIs] or without) in patients with early HIV infections.
      This study also looks at whether a drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2) can boost the immune
      system of these patients.

      Doctors are not sure which anti-HIV drug combination is best to use in patients who have
      early HIV infection and have never received anti-HIV treatment. PIs are anti-HIV drugs that
      decrease viral load (level of HIV in the blood). However, PIs can cause serious side effects
      in some patients. Doctors would like to know if a drug combination that does not contain a PI
      is just as good as one that contains PIs.

      Studies have suggested that an antiretroviral drug regimen of the non-nucleoside agent
      efavirenz (EFV) in combination with two nucleoside analogues is effective at achieving
      maximal viral suppression. This provides an alternative treatment to that of the more toxic
      PI-containing regimen. This trial examines whether a nonPI regimen with EFV is more
      beneficial than a PI-containing regimen when each is used in combination with the same two
      nucleoside analogues. A second part of the study looks at whether the addition of IL-2 may
      offer immunologic benefits as a co-administered drug.

      Patients are randomized to initiate antiretroviral therapy of a PI-based
      (stavudine/didanosine/ritonavir [RTV]/indinavir [IDV]) or nonPI-based
      (stavudine/didanosine/EFV) regimen. Within these treatment arms, they are stratified
      according to a positive or negative p24 antigen result. At Week 16, patients not achieving
      maximal viral suppression (lower than 50 copies/ml) have the option to add abacavir (ABC) or
      other drugs as intensification therapy. Those achieving virologic suppression (less than 50
      copies/ml) are randomized either to receive IL-2 or not. At study entry, and after 12 months,
      tissue samples of CSF, lymph node, and genital secretions are obtained, with permission.
      Patients have physical exams, women of child-bearing potential have pregnancy tests, and
      blood samples are drawn at clinic visits 12-16 times a year over 3 years so that virologic
      and immunologic evaluations may be performed. Compensation for time and transportation is
      given.
