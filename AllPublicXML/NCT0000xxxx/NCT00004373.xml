      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the benzodiazepine alprazolam reinforces self-medication
      behavior in anxious patients with varying histories of using other drugs.

      II. Establish outpatient methods for the study of self-medication and drug reinforcement in
      patients vulnerable to prescription drug abuse or dependence.

      III. Evaluate the influence of alcohol and other non-prescription drug use as determinants of
      vulnerability in these patients.

      IV. Identify personality, attitudinal, or other variables that might predict different
      patterns of self-medication.

      V. Assess the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on alprazolam self-medication.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This protocol involves different experiments examining self-medication with
      anxiolytic medications in selected patients, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety.
      Capsules are color coded and taken under double-blind conditions. Compliance is monitored
      with the Medication Event Monitoring System, which automatically registers the date and time
      each bottle is opened.

      The physician directs therapy administration, using some combination of the following: blind
      choice test, antianxiety agent(s), placebo, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.
