      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether chronic hypercortisolemia is specifically toxic to
      hippocampal cells and causes structural reduction of hippocampal volume in patients with
      Cushing's syndrome.

      II. Determine whether reduced hippocampal volume is associated with specific memory
      dysfunction.

      III. Examine the relationships of adrenal androgen to hippocampal volume and memory
      dysfunction.

      IV. Examine the reversibility of hippocampal structural changes and cognitive dysfunction
      after cortisol levels are normalized.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo a psychiatric evaluation for mood and cognition during
      confirmation of diagnosis. Neuropsychologic exams include pencil and paper test and a
      cognitive assessment.

      Endocrine studies include dexamethasone and corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation
      tests. The hippocampal complex volume is assessed with coronal magnetic resonance imaging.

      There is a follow-up 1 year after the initiation of treatment.
