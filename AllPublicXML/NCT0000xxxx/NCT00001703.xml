  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 27,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are diagnosed every year in the United
      States. 11,000 of these cases will die from the disease. More than half of patients present
      with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited role.
      Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed. Cancers in humans are
      commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes. These genes produce
      mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells. Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) gene which is
      associated with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and cloned, and
      it is found to be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas.

      Data in mice have shown the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) that are capable of detecting endogenous cytoplasmic peptide
      derived from mutated oncogenes. In addition, we have recently demonstrated, by conducting
      different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate cancer patients with mutated Ras or
      p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients harbor in their tumors, that in some
      patients we can generate immunological responses represented by the generation of lymphocytes
      (CD4+ and/or CD8+). In the current study, we would like to extend our observations to test
      whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be immunologically targeted by vaccination. We have
      identified specific epitopes along the amino acid sequence of the VHL protein, which
      represent known specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I binding motifs. These amino
      acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point mutation hot spots.
      Therefore, we propose to treat patients with sporadic RCC who carry VHL mutations in their
      tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination. This vaccination will be done
      either by using pulsed-autologous peripheral mononuclear cells with the peptides, or peptides
      administered subcutaneously alone or in combination with cytokines.

    <description>The immunological response was assessed by in-vitro T cell cytokine production enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT). From each patients, post-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were compared to pre-vaccination as a baseline. A positive ELISPOT result for the patients was defined as a total number of experimental spots in the post-vaccination sample of more than twofold above the total spots in the pre-vaccination sample.</description>

From each patients, post-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were compared to pre-vaccination as a baseline.
