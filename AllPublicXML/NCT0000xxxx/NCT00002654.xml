      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known if radiation therapy plus chemotherapy is more effective than
      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus
      cisplatin with radiation therapy alone in treating patients with advanced head and neck
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the time to treatment failure (local and regional) in patients with
      moderately advanced and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (no distant
      metastases) when treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy with vs. without 2 courses of
      simultaneously administered cisplatin. II. Assess the time to distant metastatic relapse,
      overall survival, and toxicity in patients receiving these treatments. III. Evaluate whether
      the potential tumor-doubling time is an indicator for risk of treatment failure in patients
      receiving these treatments.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy followed, as
      indicated, by Surgery. Hyperfractionated external-beam tumor irradiation using photon
      energies of 4-6 MV or electrons of 6-12 MV (interstitial brachytherapy boost to lesions of
      the oral cavity allowed); plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; followed, in patients with
      persistent disease (at the discretion of the surgeon), by resection of primary tumor or
      involved nodes. Arm II: Hyperfractionated radiotherapy followed by Surgery. Tumor irradiation
      as in Arm I; followed by resection as in Arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 400 patients will be accrued over 5 years. Interim analyses to
      allow for early stopping will be carried out after entry of 50 and 100 patients.
