  <brief_summary>

      To determine the safety and tolerance of methotrexate in HIV-infected patients. To determine
      the dose effective in modulating key markers of immune activation. To determine a dose
      suitable for Phase II or III evaluation in HIV-infected patients.

      In HIV infection, complete immunological clearance of the foreign antigen does not occur,
      resulting in chronic immune activation. Because chronic immune activation may contribute to
      disease progression in HIV infection, immunomodulators may have therapeutic value in early
      HIV disease prior to development of opportunistic infections. The clinical benefits of
      methotrexate appear to derive from an anti-inflammatory effect; thus, it may reduce the state
      of chronic immune activation.

      In HIV infection, complete immunological clearance of the foreign antigen does not occur,
      resulting in chronic immune activation. Because chronic immune activation may contribute to
      disease progression in HIV infection, immunomodulators may have therapeutic value in early
      HIV disease prior to development of opportunistic infections. The clinical benefits of
      methotrexate appear to derive from an anti-inflammatory effect; thus, it may reduce the state
      of chronic immune activation.

      Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate at Dose 1 or 2 (low doses) for 12 weeks, with
      8 weeks of follow-up. If interim safety monitoring and viral burden results for the two
      cohorts support continuation, a third cohort of patients receive methotrexate starting at
      Dose 2 for the first 2 weeks, then at Dose 3 for the next 2 weeks, and at Dose 4 for the
      remaining 8 weeks, with 8 weeks of follow-up.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 1/10/97:

      The Dose 1 (the lowest dose) has been eliminated; the first 10 patients are now assigned to
      the next higher dose. Depending upon the results of interim safety data, the next cohort will
      be entered on the escalating dose regimen.

      Also per this amendment, all patients will receive zidovudine and lamivudine for 30 days
      prior to the initiation of methotrexate, during the 12 weeks of methotrexate administration,
      and for the 8 weeks of follow-up.

             entry). [AS

        PER AMENDMENT 1/10/97:

          -  Combination zidovudine/lamivudine or zidovudine alone.]

        Patients must have:
