      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus topotecan in treating
      patients who have non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan and chest irradiation in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the degree of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan and thoracic radiotherapy.

      Beginning on day 1, patients receive topotecan IV continuously for 3-6 weeks and thoracic
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2, 3, or 6 weeks. Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of topotecan and thoracic radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each
      therapy is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Six additional patients are treated at the MTD.
      Patients who fail to achieve complete remission (CR) and continue to have measurable disease
      at 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy receive topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21
      at 1 dose level preceding the MTD as determined by the ongoing Protocol NYU-9123. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
