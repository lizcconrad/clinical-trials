      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as CT scans help the doctor in detecting cancer or the
      recurrence of cancer. Increasing the number of times a CT scan is given may improve the
      ability to detect stage I testicular cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to determine if there is a different result from two
      different schedules of CT scans in treating patients with stage I testicular cancer after
      undergoing orchiectomy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether there is a difference between two schedules of CT scan surveillance in
           respect to stage of disease at relapse, survival, the investigation determining relapse,
           and incidence of second malignancies in patients with stage I testicular teratoma after
           orchidectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and
      presence of vascular invasion.

      After orchidectomy, patients are randomized into two schedules (arms I and II) of CT scan
      follow up.

        -  Arm I: Patients repeat chest and abdominal CT scans no later than 3 months after
           orchidectomy and again at 12 months to confirm that the patient is clear of disease.

        -  Arm II: Patients repeat chest and abdominal CT scans at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after
           orchidectomy.

      Patients are followed monthly for the first year after orchidectomy, then every 2 months for
      the second year, then every 3 months for the third year, and then every 4-6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 400-900 patients accrued into this study over 3-6 years.

             disease:

               -  No evidence of metastatic disease on clinical examination

               -  Normal chest x-ray
