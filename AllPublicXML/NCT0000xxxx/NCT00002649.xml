    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with that of
      observation following radiation therapy, combination chemotherapy, and peripheral stem cell
      transplantation in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
      Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      cells. Giving interleukin-2 after radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the survival and disease-free survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      treated with post-transplant therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or no further treatment.
      Transplant therapy is total body irradiation (TBI), high-dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide and
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).

      II. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with post-transplant IL-2
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease grade (low vs intermediate vs high), chemosensitive disease (yes vs no), partial or
      complete response after initial induction chemotherapy (yes vs no), and performance status
      (0-1 vs 2).

      Part I: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested before study entry.
      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -8 to -5, high-dose etoposide IV
      over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -2. PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0 and then filgrastim (G-CSF) may be administered subcutaneously or IV on days 0-21.

      Part II: Within 28-80 days after PBSC transplantation and after recovery from any toxic
      effects, patients with no active recurrent or progressive disease are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 1-4 and 9-18.

      Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 275 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5-5.9
      years.

             compatible with CHF; EKG must be performed within 42 days prior to registration

          -  All patients must have a pretreatment serum creatinine of =&lt; 1.5 times the
             institutional upper limit of normal measured after completion of prior therapy and
             within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have adequate pulmonary function as measured by a DLCO &gt;= 65% of
             predicted or FEV1 &gt;= 65% of predicted measured after completion of prior therapy and
             within 120 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as measured by a bilirubin of =&lt; 1.5 x
             the institutional upper limit of normal and SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2 x the institutional

          -  Patients must have recovered from the nadir resulting from the last cancer therapy;
             this will generally be at least four weeks from prior radiation or chemotherapy, and
             six weeks from nitrosoureas

          -  Patients must have a Southwest Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Patients must have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis performed within 28 days

             with cyclophosphamide are not eligible

          -  Patients who have received prior involved field irradiation prohibiting the use of TBI
             are not eligible

          -  Patients must be negative for antibody to HIV and this test must have been performed
             within 42 days prior to registration; patients must not have an autoimmune disease or
             have had a prior allogeneic (from someone else) organ or tissue transplant

          -  If day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next
             working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or
             measurement is done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the
             Monday four weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient
             scheduling without exceeding the guidelines

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous
             cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other cancer for which the patient has

             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the statistical center in order to ensure that the current (within
             365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered
             into the database

          -  REGISTRATION # 2 (RANDOMIZATION)

          -  Patients who are less than 28 days or more than 80 days after PBSCT will not be
             registered for randomization

          -  Patients known to be ineligible for registration step #1 may not be registered to
             registration step #2

          -  Restaging radiographic studies are not required between PBSCT and registration #2
             (randomization), however, patients with known active recurrent or progressive disease
             are not eligible for randomization
