    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Hormones can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy may
      fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of hormone
      therapy and radiation therapy is more effective for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of
      hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of moderate-duration (28 weeks) neoadjuvant total androgen
           suppression (TAS) and radiotherapy (RT) with short-duration (8 weeks) neoadjuvant TAS
           and RT, as related to disease-specific survival, in patients with intermediate-risk
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Compare these regimens, in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, time to
           local tumor progression or distant failure, time to first biochemical failure,
           hormone-refractory state, and treatment-induced morbidity, in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      prostate-specific antigen level (no greater than 10 ng/mL vs greater than 10 but no greater
      than 20 ng/mL vs greater than 20 ng/mL), tumor stage (T1b-2 vs T3-4), Gleason score (2-4 vs
      5-6 vs 7-10), and prior hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive total androgen suppression for 8 weeks prior to the initiation
           of radiotherapy and throughout radiotherapy. A luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
           (LHRH) agonist is administered every 1-3 months AND bicalutamide OR flutamide is given
           orally daily for a total duration of 16 weeks. Beginning with week 9, patients undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive total androgen suppression for 28 weeks prior to the initiation
           of radiotherapy and throughout radiotherapy. An LHRH agonist AND bicalutamide OR
           flutamide are administered as in arm I for a total duration of 36 weeks. Beginning with
           week 29, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,540 patients (770 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.

    <description>Disease-specific survival time is measured from date of randomization to death due to prostate cancer based on study chair review, with prostate-cancer death defined as (1) primary cause of death certified as due to prostate cancer, (2) complication of therapy, irrespective of disease status, (3) disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy, or (4) a 1.0 ng/ml-exceeding-rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurs during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy. Death due to other causes is considered a competing risk. All others are censored. DSS is estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Ten-year rate is reported.</description>

    <description>Time to distant metastasis measured from date of randomization to date of documented distant metastasis; competing risks are BF, LRP, and death without DM; all others are censored. Time to locoregional progression measured from date of randomization to date of documented local or regional progression; competing risks are BF [protocol definition- first of (1) the midway date between the last non-rising PSA and the first rising PSA of three consecutive rises or (2) the date of the initiation of salvage hormone therapy], DM, and death without LRP; all others are censored. LRP and DM are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Ten -year rates are reported.</description>

Phoenix definition: Time to BF measured from date of randomization to first of (1) the date of documented rise of 2 ng/ml above the post-treatment(RT end date) nadir or (2) the date of the initiation of salvage hormone therapy; competing risks are LRP, DM, and death without BF; all others are censored.

    <description>Time to SBF measured from date of randomization to the date of PSA increase of ≥1.0 ng/mL (from the nadir PSA after completion of protocol-specified therapy) after salvage androgen suppression was started; competing risks LRP, DM, and death without SBF; all others are censored. SBF is estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Ten-year rates are reported.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-induced Morbidity (Highest Grade Toxicity Reported Per Patient)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 10 years. (Patients are followed until death or study termination, whichever occurs first.)</time_frame>
    <description>Acute drug therapy and radiation (&lt;= 90 days from start of RT) toxicity was graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) v.2.0 criteria; late toxicity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring schema. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The CTC v2.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild toxicity, Grade 2 Moderate toxicity, Grade 3 Severe toxicity, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling toxicity, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity. The highest grade acute and late toxicity was determined for each patient.</description>

             but not palpable, will not alter T stage):

               -  Clinical stage T1b-4, Gleason score 2-6, and prostate-specific antigen &gt;10 but ≤

               -  Clinical stage ≥T2 and Gleason score ≥ 8 (any prostate-specific antigen).

          2. Patients at low risk for disease relapse as determined by:

             • Clinical stage ≤T2, Gleason score ≤ 6, and prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10.

          3. Clinical stage Tx, T0, or T1a.

          4. Histologic or radiologic evidence of tumor involvement of regional lymph nodes (N1) or
             the presence of metastatic disease (M1).

          5. Pretherapy serum prostate-specific antigen level &gt; 100.

               -  Pelvic external beam radiation therapy.

               -  Radionuclide prostate brachytherapy.

               -  Prostatectomy or prostatic cryosurgery.

                  before randomization, and (2) Casodex or Eulexin was (or will be) started no more
                  than 14 days before or after the date that the LHRH agonist injection was given.
                  Any finasteride therapy administered for prostatic hypertrophy must be
                  discontinued.

               -  Chemotherapy for prostatic carcinoma.

          8. Previous or concomitant invasive cancer, other than localized basal cell or squamous
             cell skin carcinoma (AJCC Stage 0-II), unless continually disease free for at least 5
             years.

          9. Major medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, would

Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity.
