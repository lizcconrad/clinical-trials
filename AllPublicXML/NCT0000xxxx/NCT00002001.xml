          -  It is intended that patients developing new opportunistic infections during the course
             of the study will continue study participation, unless required therapy is associated
             with significant neurologic or hematologic toxicities, in which case the study
             medication may be temporarily discontinued.

          -  Ganciclovir.

          -  Chloramphenicol.
