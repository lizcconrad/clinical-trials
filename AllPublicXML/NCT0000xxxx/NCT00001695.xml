  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simultaneous use of alternative or complementary medical therapies by cancer patients
      undergoing conventional medical treatment is extremely common and may not always be disclosed
      to the patient's treating physician. Cancer patients undergoing Phase I therapy on clinical
      trials constitute a special population of patients, since by definition, their prescribed
      therapy is scientifically unproven in terms of efficacy. Phase I patients are closely
      monitored for adverse effects in order to identify and characterize the toxicities and to
      define a tolerable dose of their experimental treatment. Thus, the unrecognized use of
      alternative therapies by patients actively enrolled in phase I trials may potentially
      confound rational drug development by causing adverse side effects or by contributing to drug
      interactions. Examples of clinical toxicities induced by alternative medical treatments
      include liver dysfunction or renal failure caused by herbal preparations, or hematologic
      abnormalities, such as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome caused by tryptophan food supplements.
      Therefore, it is important to document and determine the prevalence of alternative therapy
      use in this specific patient population; however, this issue has not previously been examined
      in a scientifically rigorous manner. We propose to conduct a survey and interview study of
      phase I cancer patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute
      to determine the prevalence of alternative therapy use in this population. This study will
      also examine patient attitudes and perceptions regarding their use of alternative therapy as
      compared with their scientifically-sanctioned phase I experimental therapy. This information
      has important implications for drug development.
