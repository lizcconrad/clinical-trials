  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and antiretroviral effectiveness of combined oral
      zidovudine (AZT) and intermittent intravenous foscarnet therapy in stable AIDS or AIDS
      related complex (ARC) patients who have already received AZT for 8 - 52 weeks.

      It is hypothesized that the maximum AZT antiretroviral effect, which occurs at 8 weeks of
      therapy, will be enhanced by 2 weeks of foscarnet treatment, given at the same time by
      intermittent intravenous infusion. In addition, the further lowering of serum p24 antigen
      concentration that should occur during combined therapy might continue when oral AZT therapy
      is continued without foscarnet.

      It is hypothesized that the maximum AZT antiretroviral effect, which occurs at 8 weeks of

      intermittent intravenous infusion. In addition, the further lowering of serum p24 antigen
      concentration that should occur during combined therapy might continue when oral AZT therapy
      is continued without foscarnet.

      There is a 4-week prestudy monitoring period during which AZT alone is administered on an
      outpatient basis, followed by a 2-week study period during which both intravenous foscarnet
      and oral AZT are administered in the hospital. During the subsequent 6-month follow-up
      period, oral AZT is administered and patients receive clinical evaluations. AZT is held for
      48 hours on days before hospitalization and for 24 hours at the end of the hospitalization.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Received zidovudine (AZT) 200 mg every 4 hours (q4h) continuously for 8 - 16 weeks
             without Grade 3 or higher toxicity.

          -  Detectable p24 antigen in serum on at least 2 occasions during the prestudy period.
             All serum p24 antigen concentrations measured during the prestudy period must be at
             least twice the concentration cutoff value of the assay.

          -  Capability of giving informed consent.

          -  Per amendment of 890721, patients must enter the study period by September 30, 1989.

          -  History of Grade 3 or 4 toxicity with AZT.

          -  Current Grade 2 or higher AZT toxicity.

          -  Osteomalacia, neoplasm metastatic to bone, or other known bone disease.

          -  Active opportunistic infection requiring myelosuppressive or nephrotoxic therapy.
