  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research participants will be asked to undergo complete medical history, physical examination
      and blood tests. The purpose of these tests is to determine whether persons are predisposed
      to develop diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation and also to make an early diagnosis
      if a patient develops diabetes mellitus. Medical information collected as part of the
      standard transplant evaluation and posttransplant medical care may be incorporated into this
      study. It is important to realize that research subjects will not be given an experimental
      drug as part of this study.

      After kidney transplantation, research subjects will be followed in the posttransplant clinic
      visits. The study will last up to 6 months. During this time the subjects may be asked to
      participate in clinical assessment visits (medical history and physical examination), and
      also during the third or fourth month after transplant will be asked to do a repeat glucose
      tolerance test.
