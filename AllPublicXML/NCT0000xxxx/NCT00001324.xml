  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate activity in areas of
      the brain. The PET technique allows researchers to study the normal processes in the brain
      (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without
      physical / structural damage to the brain.

      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar
      (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and
      water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain
      activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity also increases. This is known
      as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive
      water (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow.

      In this study researchers plan to investigate the changes in regional cerebral blood flow
      (rCBF) as patients participate in different activities. The activities are designed to
      stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for voluntary motor activity and sensation. By
      comparing the results of PET scans performed in different conditions, researchers can locate
      regions of the brain responsible for specific tasks.

      This study should provide new information about voluntary movements in humans and the
      preparation involved in controlling them.

      The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology
      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place
      during disease. To this end, we will investigate changes in regional cerebral blood flow
      (rCBF) as an index of regional neuronal activity, associated with various motor and sensory
      tasks using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The rCBF will be obtained by measuring the
      distribution of the cerebral radioactivity during emission scans following the intravenous
      bolus injection of 15O-labeled water. The very short half-life of 15O (2 minutes) allows us
      to measure rCBF repeatedly under different task conditions (see methodology and experimental
      procedures). With the comparison between PET scans performed in different conditions, we can
      detect the specific task-related activated regions. PET images will be coregistered to high
      resolution Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to get more accurate anatomical information
      regarding the activated areas. The results will be correlated with that from other
      physiological approaches including Electroencephalography (EEG), Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy (MRS). These studies should provide new information not only about the executive
      component of the voluntary movements in humans but also the different organizational aspects
      of the preparatory processes that control them.
