      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating adults with
      newly diagnosed primary malignant glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of temozolomide in adults with newly diagnosed
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Define the relationship between tumor O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity and
           tumor response in these patients.

        -  Define the relationship between tumor DNA mismatch repair activity and tumor response to
           temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive temozolomide orally once daily on days 1-5. Treatment courses are
      repeated every 28 days. In the absence of disease progression and toxicity, patients receive
      up to 4 courses of treatment prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, patients
      demonstrating partial or complete response may receive an additional 12 courses of treatment.

      Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 50 patients.
