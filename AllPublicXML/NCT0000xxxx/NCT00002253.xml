  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the relapse rate in patients with
      AIDS-related diarrhea who were found to be &quot;Responders&quot; in a previous placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study of Sandostatin (Study #D203 - FDA 102A).

      The secondary objectives include: 1) To evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of open-label
      Sandostatin in patients who were &quot;Non-Responders&quot; in Study #D203 - FDA 102A; 2) To evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Sandostatin during prolonged open-label treatment in &quot;Responders&quot;
      from Study #D03 - FDA 102A.
