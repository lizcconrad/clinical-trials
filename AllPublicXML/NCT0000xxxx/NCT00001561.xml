      Multiple Myeloma remains a largely incurable disease with current therapy. Allogeneic bone
      marrow transplantation provides an opportunity to add the potential antitumor effect of
      marrow grafts to those of high dose chemotherapy. One potential strategy for enhancing a
      graft vs. tumor effect without aggravating graft vs. host disease would be to selectively
      target an immune response against a defined tumor-specific antigen. The idiotype of the
      rearranged immunoglobulin gene product of a myeloma can serve as a unique tumor-specific
      antigen for vaccine development. We are testing the hypothesis that tumor antigen-specific
      immunity can be adoptively transferred to BMT recipients by active immunization of marrow
      transplant donors with purified myeloma idiotype protein, conjugated to a carrier protein
      (KLH) and administered with GM-CSF as an immunological adjuvant.

      Patients under age 60 with an HLA-matched sibling donor, with minimal prior treatment,
      defined by less than six months prior chemotherapy, and who are in a minimal residual disease
      state prior to allogeneic BMT, as defined by the achievement of at least a PR, are eligible.
      HLA matched sibling donors receive a series of three vaccinations during an eight week period
      prior to bone marrow harvest. Recipients concurrently receive vaccinations pre-BMT, as well
      as three booster vaccinations at weeks 12, 16, and 24 post-BMT. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is
      administered s.c. GM-CSF (250 micrograms/m(2)) is administered s.c. locally with the vaccine
      on the day of vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination. The
      objective of this protocol is to induce cellular and humoral immunity in marrow transplant
      donors and recipients against the unique idiotype expressed by the recipient's myeloma.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patient Selection:

        Patients with IgG or IgA multiple myeloma who attain at least a PR before transplantation
        are eligible for thsi protocol.

        Patients may only have received 3-4 courses of VAD, high dose cyclophosphamide and one
        autologous transplant before entering the study.

        All previous therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry.

        Patients should have recovered from all hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity of
        previous therapy.

        Steroid must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to vaccination.

        Only patients less than 60 years are eligible for this protocol.

        Patients must meet the following criteria:

        A. Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70 percent.

        B. Life expectancy greater than 8 weeks and absence of co-existing medical problems which
        would significantly increase the risk of the transplant procedure in the judgment of the
        bone marrow transplant attending physicians (e.g., the MUGA left ventricular ejection
        fraction has to be greater than 50% and DLCO greater thant 50% of the expected value when
        corrected for Hb).

        Creatinine less than 2x normal and not rising for at least 2-4 weeks before
        transplantation. If creatinine is elevated, then creatinine clearance must be greater than
        40 ml/min.

        Direct bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl, SGOT less than 4x top normal, and none of these
        parameters increasing, for at least 2-4 weeks before transplantation.

        Patients must be HIV-negative, HBsAg-, and Hepatitis C antibody Negative.

        Not pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method
        of contraception.

        M-protein concentration in the harvested plasma must be greater than 90 percent of the
        total Ig of the corresponding isotype.

        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

        Donor criteria:

        Any consenting healthy individual who fulfills the donor criteria will be considered for
        the marrow donation.

        HLA-identical sibling donors.

        HLA, A and B and DR phenotypically identical family donors.

        HIV, hepatitis B or C seropositive.

        Complete blood count, platelets, and PT, PTT within normal limits.
