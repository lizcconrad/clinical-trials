      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of treatment medications (methadone,
      buprenorphine, LAAM, naltrexone, naltrexone microcapsules, and methoclocinnamox) on I.V. and
      smoked heroin self-administration.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abuse of prescription opioid medications has increased dramatically in the U.S. during the
      past decade, as indicated by a variety of epidemiological sources. However, few studies have
      systematically examined the relative reinforcing effects of commonly abused opioid
      medications. The current inpatient study was designed to compare the effects of intravenously
      delivered fentanyl , oxycodone, morphine, buprenorphine and heroin in morphine-maintained
      heroin abusers. All of the participants received all of the drugs tested; drugs and doses
      were administered in non-systematic order.
