  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving nandrolone decanoate (a hormonal drug) will
      cause weight gain in HIV-positive women who have HIV-associated weight loss (wasting).

      Wasting has become an AIDS-defining condition. In the past, most studies that examined
      wasting treatments were limited to men. However, it appears that wasting in HIV-positive men
      is linked to levels of testosterone (a hormone which affects men's bodies more than women's).
      This study has been designed for women only, in order to best treat wasting in HIV-positive
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body wasting is an increasingly frequent AIDS-defining condition and it is becoming evident
      that women are not exempt from this complication of HIV. Although multicenter trials of
      megestrol acetate, dronabinol and growth hormone have not specifically excluded women, women
      have generally been underrepresented in these trials. This study hopes to generate data that
      will be substantial enough to perform an analysis that might determine whether there are
      gender-based differences in anabolic potential.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either nandrolone decanoate or placebo every 2 weeks
      for 12 weeks of the study. All patients who complete the first 12 weeks of the study will be
      eligible to receive open-label nandrolone for the subsequent 12 weeks.
