  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy alone is more effective than radiation
      therapy plus chemotherapy in treating cancer of the nasopharynx.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy works compared to radiation therapy alone in treating patients with previously
      untreated cancer of the nasopharynx.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the clinical response, distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall
           survival in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, nonmetastatic
           nasopharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy alone vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy
           followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients are randomized to receive radiotherapy alone (arm I) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (arm II).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 times a week for 7 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6-8 hours for 4 consecutive days every 3
           weeks for 3 courses. Concurrent radiotherapy is given once daily 5 times a week over the
           7 week treatment period. This chemoradiotherapy is followed 3 weeks later by adjuvant
           chemotherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV and fluorouracil IV over 6-8 hours for 4
           consecutive days every 4 weeks for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
