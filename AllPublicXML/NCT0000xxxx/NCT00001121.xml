  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term consequences of HIV-1 infections that
      occurred in association with known, but discouraged, high-risk behaviors in persons who have
      received HIV candidate vaccines or placebo in HIVNET 014. Doctors need to look at how these
      patients respond to HIV infection in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments
      for HIV and AIDS.

      Patients who receive HIV vaccines are sometimes protected from HIV infection. More often,
      these patients become HIV-positive but experience a boost in their immune system that helps
      their bodies fight HIV. Doctors need to look at how these patients respond to HIV infection
      in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS.

      There are many possible outcomes of HIV-1 infection among persons who receive experimental
      HIV-1 vaccines. In the best-case scenario, these vaccines may prevent infection (sterilizing
      immunity). However, current viral vaccines are thought to limit, but not prevent, virus
      replication after infection. In the latter case, it is important to document the effect of
      the immune response on the disease course as reflected by viral load, the evolution of the
      viral quasi species, and clinical symptoms over time. Understanding the evolution of the
      immune response in vaccinees after subsequent exposure and HIV infection will potentially
      result in valuable information for the subsequent design of preventive and therapeutic
      vaccines. This will be studied here using HIVNET 014 participants at higher risk for HIV-1
      infection.

      Participants discontinue HIVNET 014 vaccinations upon confirmation of HIV-1 infection and are
      enrolled in this study. Participants undergo clinical and laboratory examinations every 3
      months for the first year of follow-up and every 6 months for at least 4 years thereafter.
      Additionally, HIV-infected partners of HIVNET 014A participants undergo clinical and
      laboratory examination at enrollment, and may be asked to donate additional specimens at a
      later time. Study endpoints include various virologic, immunologic, and clinical parameters,
      such as viral load, cellular immune response, and virus phenotype and genotype.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Become infected with HIV while participating in HIVNET 014, or if they are an
             HIV-positive partner (sexual or needle-sharing) of a HIVNET 014A participant.

          -  Are able and willing to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have a serious psychiatric or psychological disorder that would prevent them from
             completing the study.
