      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose interleukin-2 in treating
      patients with metastatic or recurrent kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
           treated with low-dose intravenous interleukin-2.

        -  Assess the toxicity associated with this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose intravenous interleukin-2 every 8 hours for a maximum of
      15 doses in week 1 and again in week 3. Stable and responding patients receive a second
      course beginning approximately 2 months after initiation of the first course. Responding
      patients may continue therapy every 2 months provided toxicity is limited.

      Patients whose diseased kidney comprises the bulk of the tumor burden at entry undergo
      nephrectomy.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
