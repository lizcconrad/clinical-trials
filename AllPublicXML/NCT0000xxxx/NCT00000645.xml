  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypericin, to define the types of toxicities
      that may be observed, and to determine what doses of the drug are associated with
      improvements in virological and immunological surrogate markers of HIV infection. To
      determine the bioavailability of synthetic hypericin given in 2 percent benzyl alcohol
      solution.

      Hypericin is unlike other drugs presently being used to treat AIDS patients. Hypericin shows
      anti-HIV activity in test tube experiments.

      Hypericin is unlike other drugs presently being used to treat AIDS patients. Hypericin shows
      anti-HIV activity in test tube experiments.

      Each group of eight patients receives a given dose of hypericin by intravenous infusion.
      Doses are given three times per week for 8 weeks. When all eight patients at a dose level
      have been entered and four of the eight patients have completed 3 weeks of therapy without
      evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, additional patients may begin to receive drug at the next
      dose level. Concurrently, six patients wll participate in an oral-dosing bioavailability
      study. NOTE: The initial study was stopped secondary to an MTD being reached.
