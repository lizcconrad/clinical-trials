  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of three dose treatment plans of oral
      ganciclovir during a 28-day dosing period. Other purposes of the study are to determine in a
      population of HIV seropositive persons with cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, the safety,
      tolerance, and patient acceptability of oral ganciclovir given for 28 days, to collect
      preliminary laboratory evidence for antiviral activity and effectiveness of three dose
      regimens of oral ganciclovir based on blood and urine cultures of CMV, and to relate
      antiviral activity to dosage and to serum ganciclovir levels.

      CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects about
      10 to 15 percent of people with AIDS. A previous study has shown that treatment with
      ganciclovir resulted in a significant delay in time to first retinitis progression compared
      to untreated controls. More studies are warranted to evaluate effects at different doses.

      CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects about
      10 to 15 percent of people with AIDS. A previous study has shown that treatment with
      ganciclovir resulted in a significant delay in time to first retinitis progression compared
      to untreated controls. More studies are warranted to evaluate effects at different doses.

      In group A, 36 HIV seropositive patients with CMV viruria receive a single dose of
      intravenous ganciclovir followed by one of three oral dose regimens for 28 days. Twelve
      individuals are treated at each dose level. In group B, 12 patients with AIDS and CMV
      retinitis receive oral ganciclovir therapy. These 12 patients must have received an induction
      course of intravenous ganciclovir for 4 weeks prior to study entry and must have stable CMV
      retinitis. Measurements for both groups include pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance
      (history, physical examination, hematology, and serum chemistry), and CMV blood and urine
      cultures. In addition, there are weekly ophthalmologic evaluations for individuals in the
      group B study.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Topical acyclovir.

        There are two groups of patients. Group A must have:

          -  Confirmation of HIV infection by HIV antibody testing, p24 antigen, or culture of HIV.

          -  A positive urine culture for cytomegalovirus (CMV) within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  Not received prior ganciclovir therapy.

        Group B must have:

          -  A diagnosis of AIDS by CDC criteria.

          -  CMV retinitis diagnosed on funduscopic evaluation by an ophthalmologist.

          -  Completed 4 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir with an improvement or stabilization of
             retinitis. The course of therapy should include a minimum of 24 days total of
             intravenous ganciclovir.

          -  Patients in both groups must understand the nature of the study, agree to the tests
             required in the protocol, and must understand and sign an informed consent form
             approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by Syntex.

        Required:

        Group B:

          -  4 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir which should include a minimum of 24 days total of
             intravenous ganciclovir.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:
