  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of and immune response to vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope
      glycoprotein (gp160) at a dose of 200 mcg in human volunteers; to evaluate duration of
      antibody response and its relationship to the dose and frequency of inoculation.

      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently
      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that the ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently
      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that the ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Healthy, adult volunteers without identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV-1 infection are
      randomly assigned to receive three injections of either 200 mcg gp160 vaccine or a placebo.
      At each participating site, four volunteers receive vaccine and two volunteers receive
      placebo. Primary immunization and two booster immunizations at day 30 and day 180 are done in
      an outpatient setting. Volunteers are closely monitored for the first 2 weeks
      postimmunization (primary and boosters), and extensively followed for 2 years. Volunteers may
      be offered an additional booster of the same preparation at 12 months.
