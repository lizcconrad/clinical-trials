      RATIONALE: Drugs like liposomal amphotericin B may be able to relieve fungal infection which
      can be a side effect of chemotherapy. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may
      increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a
      person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known
      whether receiving liposomal amphotericin B plus sargramostim is more effective than receiving
      liposomal amphotericin B alone in treating patients with invasive fungal infection.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of liposomal
      amphotericin B with or without sargramostim in treating patients with invasive fungal
      infection.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the benefit of the cytokine sargramostim (GM-CSF) in resolving
      suspected or proven fungal infections in patients treated with systemic antifungal therapy
      (liposomal amphotericin B) who have been entered on protocols MRC-LEUK-AML11, AML12 or
      UKALLXII. II. Assess, in vitro, the effect of GM-CSF on monocyte function on cells taken from
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a double blind, supportive care study for patients on MRC-LEUK-AML11, AML12,
      or UKALLXII (or their successors). Patients are stratified according to proven or suspected
      fungal infection. Patients receive daily doses of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B based
      on stratification. All patients are then randomized to also receive either sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) (arm I) or a placebo (arm II) by subcutaneous injections (intravenous infusion over
      4-6 hours is permitted if subcutaneous route is unacceptable). Treatment continues for 42
      days. Some patients with localized lesions that clinically improve should be considered for
      surgical removal of the residual lesion. Patients may continue therapy after 42 days at the
      physician's discretion. Patients are assessed weekly until the end of study (particularly on
      day 28 and at end of study).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 200 patients (100 in each arm) accrued into this study.
