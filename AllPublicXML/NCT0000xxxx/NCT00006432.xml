  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some consensus that high fat diets can contribute to the development of obesity and
      type 2 diabetes in humans and animals. An increase in dietary fat has been shown to produce
      obesity and diabetes in mice; such diet-induced diabetes can be reversed by reducing the fat
      in the diet. In humans, there is some evidence that low-fat diets can produce acute
      improvements in blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes-even in the absence of weight loss. In
      most human studies, however, dietary fat reduction has been accompanied by a reduction in
      total calorie intake. It is thus not possible to separate the effects of these 2 metabolic
      changes. The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary information on the effect of a
      very-low-fat diet on blood metabolism in persons with type 2 diabetes. The design
      incorporates controlled feeding procedures, and 30 men and women with type 2 diabetes will be
      given all foods for 4 weeks--a 2-week diet standardization period (diet composition: 35% fat,
      15% protein, 50% carbohydrate), followed by a 2-week experimental diet period. The
      experimental diet conditions are A) continuation of the moderately-high-fat standardization
      diet, or B) a very-low-fat diet composed of 10% fat, 15% protein, 75% carbohydrate. Outcomes
      will be measured after the standardization and the experimental periods. The primary outcome
      variable is fasting plasma glucose; secondary outcomes are fasting insulin, carbohydrate
      (meal) tolerance, insulin secretion and blood lipids. In addition, we will gather descriptive
      data on the potential acceptability and utility of a very-low-fat diet constructed using the
      fat substitute, olestra (sucrose polyester). There are no results yet.
