      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of three different regimens
      of combining paclitaxel and carboplatin plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have
      stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed during surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival of patients with stage IIIA or IIIB unresectable non-small
      cell lung cancer treated with one of three different combined modality regimens of
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy. II. Compare the safety and toxicity of these
      treatment regimens in these patients. III. Compare the relapse free survival rate in these
      patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks for 2 courses, followed by radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7
      weeks beginning on day 42. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I
      followed by radiotherapy 5 times a week, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes weekly for 7 weeks beginning on day 42. Arm III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes weekly and radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7
      weeks beginning on day 1, followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes every 3 weeks for 2 courses beginning 3 weeks after concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 264 patients (88 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 20 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung
        cancer (NSCLC) Stage IIIA (T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-2, M0) if not medically operable Stage
        IIIB (any T, N3, M0 or T4, any N, M0) Radiographic evidence of mediastinal lymph nodes at
        least 2.0 cm in the largest diameter sufficient to stage N2 or N3 disease If largest
        mediastinal node is less than 2.0 cm in diameter and is the basis for stage III disease,
        then at least one node must be histologically or cytologically confirmed positive Any of
        the following histologies allowed: Squamous cell carcinoma Adenocarcinoma (including
        bronchoalveolar cell) Large cell anaplastic carcinoma (including giant and clear cell
        carcinomas) Poorly differentiated NSCLC No metastatic disease Patients with tumors adjacent
        to a vertebral body allowed if all gross disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost
        field (boost volume must be limited to less than 50% of the ipsilateral lung volume)
        Pleural effusions that are a transudate, cytologically negative, and non-bloody are allowed
        if tumor can be encompassed within reasonable field of radiotherapy Pleural effusions that
        can be seen on chest CT but not on chest x-ray and are too small to tap are allowed No
        brain metastases by MRI or CT scan No prior total surgical resection
