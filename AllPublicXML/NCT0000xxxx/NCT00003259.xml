      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of vinorelbine in patients with metastatic
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of vinorelbine in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the quality of life of these patients, and correlate quality of life
      with PSA response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 5-10 minute intravenous infusion of vinorelbine on day 1 and day
      8 of a 21-day course. Patients with stabilization of their disease, partial response, or
      complete response, receive a maximum of 12 courses of treatment. Patients showing disease
      progression or severe toxic side effects discontinue treatment. Quality of life and pain are
      assessed prior to treatment, at days 1 and 8 of each course, and at end of the treatment.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
