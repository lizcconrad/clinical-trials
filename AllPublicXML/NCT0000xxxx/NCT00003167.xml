      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients with advanced
      bladder cancer. Inserting the p53 gene into a person's bladder cancer cells may improve the
      body's ability to fight cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) gene therapy in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.

      II. Measure infection with Ad-p53 and confirm expression of p53 after infection.

      III. Characterize clinical response of measurable tumor in these patients. IV. Determine the
      duration of effect of this treatment in these patients. V. Define the time course of
      elimination of vector from urinary bladder.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Group 1 patients receive adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) intravesically on days 1 and 4. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 patients in group 1 receive escalating doses of Ad-p53. In the absence of grade
      3 or worse toxicity in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 3 patients each
      receive escalating doses of Ad-p53 on the same schedule. If 1 of 3 patients experiences grade
      3 toxicity, an additional 3 patients are treated at that dose level and dose escalation
      continues. If 1 of 3 patients experience grade 4 toxicity or 2 of 3 patients experience grade
      3 toxicity, dose escalation ceases and the MTD is defined as the previous dose level. Group 2
      patients receive Ad-p53 at the MTD on days 1-4, and group 3 patients receive Ad-p53 at the
      MTD on days 1-4 and 8-11.

      Patients are followed on day 28, then every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study (3-12 patients for
      group 1; 3-6 patients for group 2; and 6 patients for group 3).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  TCC of the bladder which is muscle-invasive and has demonstrated resistance to
             platinum-based chemotherapy, or tumor stage T1 that has either failed BCG or has
             concomitant CIS

          -  Patients will be eligible if they are if they are inappropriate for cystectomy because
