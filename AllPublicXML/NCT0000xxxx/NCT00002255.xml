  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and biological activity of filgrastim (recombinant
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) given by daily subcutaneous injection prior to
      and concomitantly with erythropoietin (EPO) and zidovudine (AZT) in patients with AIDS or
      severe ARC. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and biological activity of recombinant EPO
      given three times weekly by subcutaneous injection concomitantly with G-CSF and prior to and
      concomitantly with AZT in patients with AIDS or severe ARC. To study the safety and tolerance
      of three dose levels of AZT given concomitantly with G-CSF and EPO in patients with AIDS or
      severe ARC. To study the effects of G-CSF on neutrophil function and number in patients with
      AIDS or severe ARC. To study the effect of G-CSF alone and in combination with EPO on HIV
      replication in vivo as measured by circulating HIV p24 antigen, plasma HIV viremia, and
      semiquantitative HIV cocultures.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Radiotherapy or laser therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma lesions provided dose does not
             exceed 3000 rads to any one lesion group and/or greater than 10 cm total body surface
             area.

          -  Opportunistic infection requiring ongoing therapy with known bone marrow-suppressive
             agents. (Exception:

          -  patients may take ganciclovir for treatment of CMV infections.)

          -  Evidence of a primary hematologic or infectious disorder unrelated to infection with
             the HIV virus.

          -  HIV-related dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent.

          -  More than 50 cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma lesions or progression of Kaposi's sarcoma

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Known bone marrow-suppressive agents such as trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole or
             Fansidar for PCP prophylaxis.

          -  Any other non-FDA approved agent that may have antiretroviral activity.

             days) use of Zovirax (acyclovir), and/or &gt; 3 g/day oral vitamin C.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  History of cardiovascular disease or seizures.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within the previous 4 weeks for Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Investigational drugs within the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Prior colony stimulating factor (CSF).

          -  Any non-FDA approved drug within the previous 2 weeks.
