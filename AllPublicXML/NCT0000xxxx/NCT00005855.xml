      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of efaproxiral when
      given with carmustine and to see how well they work in treating patients with progressive or
      recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of efaproxiral (RSR13) when
           administered concurrently with carmustine in patients with progressive or recurrent
           malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RSR13 when administered with carmustine in
           this patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Estimate the efficacy of this regimen at the MTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      efaproxiral (RSR13).

      Patients receive RSR13 IV over 30 minutes followed 30 minutes later by carmustine IV over 1-2
      hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of RSR13 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 or 5 of 12
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are accrued to receive treatment with RSR13 and carmustine at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study. A maximum of 47 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
