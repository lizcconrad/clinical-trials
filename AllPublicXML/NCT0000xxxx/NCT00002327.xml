  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of topical cidofovir (HPMPC) therapy for condyloma
      acuminatum in patients with HIV infection. To investigate whether topical HPMPC therapy can
      induce regression of condyloma acuminatum in patients with HIV infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four groups of 10 patients each receive topical HPMPC at 0.3 percent concentration for 5 or
      10 days total or 1.0 percent concentration for 5 or 10 days total, followed by 2 weeks of
      rest. When six patients at a given dose and schedule have completed treatment and follow-up
      without significant toxicity, subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose level.
      Patients are evaluated twice weekly during treatment and once weekly during the rest period.
      HPMPC may be extended for up to two additional courses in patients who experience no
      significant toxicity.
