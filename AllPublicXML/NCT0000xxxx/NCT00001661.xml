  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiology associated with plasticity of the
      motor system. Plasticity refers to the process by which neighboring brain cells assume the
      responsibilities of damaged or diseased brain cells.

      The mechanisms behind this process are unknown. However, researchers have several theories
      about how plastic changes take place. Possible explanations include the growth of new
      connections between brain cells and the use of previously unused connections.

      Researchers plan to use transcranial magnetic stimulation and drug intervention in order to
      determine the mechanisms responsible for specific types of plasticity.

      Previous studies have shown that certain drugs can affect the mechanisms involved in these
      changes. By using one drug at a time, researchers plan to evaluate the role of each of
      several different mechanisms in brain reorganization.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiology associated with plasticity of the
      motor system seen in a number of different circumstances. Techniques used will involve the
      combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and pharmacologic interventions. We
      propose to use drugs judged to be safe, that either potentiate GABA related intracortical
      inhibition, change presynaptic release of excitatory aminoacids like glutamate, or decrease
      the activity of the NMDA receptors (mostly antiepileptic drugs). If plastic changes expressed
      as larger motor maps or motor evoked potentials (MEP) to TMS are secondary to intracortical
      disinhibition, administration of a drug that potentiates intracortical inhibition may result
      in decreased plasticity and smaller motor maps or MEP. This finding would then identify
      intracortical disinhibition as the mechanism responsible for this type of plasticity.
      Similarly, if plastic changes decrease with a drug that inhibits release of excitatory
      aminoacids, or that antagonize the action of NMDA receptors, the mechanism underlying
      plasticity is likely to be mediated by modulation in the release of excitatory aminoacids or
      activity in NMDA-receptors.

      Results from this study will then provide information about the relative involvement of
      intracortical disinhibition, modulation in the release of excitatory aminoacids, and role of
      NMDA receptors in different settings of human plasticity.
