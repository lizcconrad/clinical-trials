      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who
      have previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the efficacy of flavopiridol in terms of response rate in patients with
           previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the time to progression and, if responses are observed, response duration in
           these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour daily for 3 days. Treatment continues every 3
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients with a
      partial response receive 2 additional courses after documented maximal tumor shrinkage.
      Patients with stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until relapse or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
