      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a
      person's white blood cells to kill leukemia or lymphoma cells. Combining these two therapies
      may be an effective treatment for leukemia and lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have leukemia or lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of a multidose regimen of humanized anti-Tac
           monoclonal antibody (HAT) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with leukemia and
           lymphoma.

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of HAT and IL-2 in a multidose schedule,
           including serum half-life of free HAT, area under the curve, and volume of distribution.

        -  Evaluate the immunogenicity of HAT.

        -  Identify immunologic parameters that correlate with efficacy.

        -  Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of HAT in these patients.

        -  Monitor patients receiving indium-111-labeled HAT for circulating infused antibody for
           pharmacokinetics, tumor imaging, and bioactivity (binding ability).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's lymphoma vs acute
      myelogenous leukemia vs chronic myelogenous leukemia).

      Patients receive humanized anti-TAC monoclonal antibody (HAT) IV over 30 minutes on day 1,
      then IV over 30 minutes every 7 days and interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily. Treatment
      continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      development of neutralizing antibodies.

      Patients are followed weekly for 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 14 each with AML and
      CML will be accrued for this study.
