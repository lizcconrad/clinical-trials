  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study which addresses the feasibility and toxicity of adding taxol to the
      two drug combination which now comprises the standard of care in newly diagnosed advanced
      stage ovarian cancer, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs will be given in a dose
      intensive fashion with the colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. Newly diagnosed patients with
      ovarian cancer will be treated with this regimen to determine the optimal dose of this
      combination. The pharmacokinetics of taxol and cisplatin DNA-adducts will be studied as well.

        All patients must have biopsy proven ovarian cancer as determined by evaluation in the
        Laboratory of Pathology, NCI.

        Germ cell and borderline histologies are specifically excluded.

        Patients must have FIGO stage III and IV disease, or FIGO Stage IIC disease with poorly
        differentiated histology, and will undergo attempted surgical debulking prior to the
        initiation of chemotherapy.

        Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy will make a patient ineligible.

        Performance status: less than or equal to ECOG 2.

        Patients must have the following end organ function:

        No brain involvement.

        No history of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias requiring

        therapy, right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock, and left bundle branch
        block.

        Renal function: creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min; patients with
        ureteral obstruction must have this corrected prior to starting therapy.

        Hepatic function: normal coagulation parameters, serum transaminases within 3 times upper
        limit of normal.

        Neurologic function: no preexisting dysfunction greater than grade 1 (exclusive of mild
        vibratory delay).

        No recent history of active GI bleeding.

        Hematologic parameters prior to starting cycle 1 of therapy: total granulocyte count
        greater than 2000 and platelet count greater than 100,000.

        Patients may not have had prior history of invasive malignancy with the exception of
        nonmelanoma skin cancer curatively treated.

        Patients must be able to give written informed consent and express a willingness to meet
        all of the expected requirements of the protocol.

        Patients must be able to begin therapy within 8 weeks of staging laparotomy and should have
        a central venous catheter placed for infusion of chemotherapy.

        All patients must be registered by calling the Orkand Corporation at 402-1732 between the
        hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM; eligibility criteria will be queried.
