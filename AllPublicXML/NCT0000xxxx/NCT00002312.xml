  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance of delavirdine mesylate ( U-90152 )
      after multiple doses given orally to asymptomatic HIV-1 positive patients who are maintained
      on a stable dose of zidovudine ( AZT ). To investigate the optimum dose regimen of U-90152
      that gives average trough concentrations &gt; 1 micromolar in combination with standard AZT
      therapy, and to examine drug interactions between the two drugs. To establish the MTD of
      U-90152 in HIV-1 positive patients on stable AZT therapy. To investigate comparative
      pharmacokinetics between HIV-1 positive men and women.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Inhaled pentamidine following completion of the inpatient pharmacokinetic portion of
             the study.

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV-1 infection.

          -  CD4 count 200 - 500 cells/mm3.

          -  Maintenance on AZT for at least 6 weeks.

          -  No active opportunistic infections.

          -  Ability to swallow numerous tablets without difficulty.

          -  Ability to have blood samples drawn.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Acute medical problems, including opportunistic infections (such as active
             cryptococcosis, pneumocystis carinii, herpes zoster, histoplasmosis, CMV) and
             nonopportunistic diseases (liver and renal disease, orthostatic hypotension,
             hypertension, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma,
             or other malignancy).

          -  Primary or secondary prophylactic medications for opportunistic infections (inhaled
             pentamidine is permitted following completion of the inpatient pharmacokinetic portion
             of the study).

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of clinically significant nervous system or muscle disease, seizure disorder,
             AIDS dementia, or psychotic disorder that might impair study compliance.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary,
             endocrine, hematologic, vascular, or collagen disease.

             TIBO, L-drugs, and HEPT).

          -  Antiretroviral agents (other than AZT) or immunomodulating agents within 15 days prior
             to study entry.

          -  Primary prophylactic drugs within 15 days prior to study entry.

          -  Any known enzyme-inducing drug or any enzyme-inhibiting agents, such as ketoconazole,
