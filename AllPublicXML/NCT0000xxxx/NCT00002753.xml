      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody in treating
      patients with recurrent gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxic effects of intracystic administration of iodine-131-labeled
      anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6. II. Identify any objective therapeutic responses to
      this treatment in patients with recurrent cystic anaplastic gliomas.

      OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy. Iodine-131-Labeled Anti-Tenascin Monoclonal Antibody 81C6,
      131I-81C6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to six patients will be entered at each dose studied.
