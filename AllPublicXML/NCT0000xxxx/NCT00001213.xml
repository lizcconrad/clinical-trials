  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is an inherited disease that results in poor growth and kidney disease, among
      other things. The damage to the kidneys and other organs is thought to be due to accumulation
      of cystine inside the cells of various body tissues. This chemical also accumulates in the
      cornea-the covering of the eye over the pupil and iris. After 10 to 20 years, the corneas of
      some patients become so packed with crystals that the surfaces may become irregular,
      occasionally causing small, painful breaks.

      Patients enrolled in a NIH study on cystinosis are receiving the drug cysteamine. Taken by
      mouth, this drug reduces cystine in some tissues, but not in the cornea. This study began in
      1986 to test whether cysteamine eye drops could prevent or reduce corneal cystine crystals in
      these patients. The drops have been very effective in removing crystals and reducing pain in
      patients who take the medication as directed. Patients who do not take the medication as
      prescribed do not benefit.

      After the effectiveness of the drops was proven, the main purpose was modified to continue to
      evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of cysteamine eye drops for treating cystine
      crystals in the corneas of patients with cystinosis until the drops are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA). When the New Drug Application (NDA) for the Sigma-Tau standard
      formulation is granted, this protocol will be terminated.

      Protocol 86-EI-0062 began as a randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5% topical cysteamine but was subsequently amended as a
      natural history protocol. Additional protocols conducted at the National Eye Institute (NEI)
      at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began after this protocol and tested various
      formulations of cysteamine topical solution for efficacy and safety in patients with
      cystinosis. Subjects from these NIH protocols testing various formulations were ultimately
      transferred to this natural history protocol for open-label treatment once it was established
      that the formulation within this study was the most effective. All subjects enrolled in this
      protocol received the most effective cysteamine topical solution formulation in both eyes.
      The control was defined as the natural course of corneal crystal accumulation in patients
      with cystinosis. The efficacy data were obtained from all of the studies conducted at NIH
      evaluating various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulations from 1986 until 2005. The
      safety data were collected from 1986 until the termination of this protocol in July 2013.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The free thiol cysteamine depletes cystinotic leukocytes and other cells of cystine, whose
      accumulation is considered the cause of organ damage in cystinosis. This organ damage
      involves most tissues of the body. Cysteamine therapy improved growth and stabilized renal
      function in pre-renal transplant cystinosis, without substantial toxicity but there was no
      noticeable effect on cystine crystal accumulation in the cornea, most likely because of
      inadequate local cysteamine concentration in the cornea. Previous studies have shown the
      safety of cysteamine 0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride and its efficacy in
      resolving the cystine corneal crystals. The main purpose of this protocol is to maintain
      topical cysteamine treatment in patients with nephropathic cystinosis until the drops are
      approved by the FDA. When the NDA for the Sigma-Tau standard formulation is granted, the
      present protocol (86-EI-0062) will be terminated.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 350 adults and children over two years old, who have a confirmed diagnosis of
      cystinosis will be enrolled.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      This is an open label treatment protocol. Eligible subjects will receive drops of cysteamine
      0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride hourly while awake in both eyes. They will
      undergo an eye examination at their baseline visit. They will take cysteamine eye drops in
      both eyes every hour during waking hours. They will return to the NIH Clinical Center for a
      follow-up safety eye examination one year after the baseline visit, and then every two years
      thereafter until the drug is available commercially.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The initial pre-specified primary outcome measure was the reduction of cystine corneal
      crystals. The post-hoc primary outcome measure (after the protocol was modified) was the
      collection of safety data.

    <description>Since efficacy of ophthalmic cysteamine was established and a New Drug Application (NDA) filed, the post-hoc primary outcome measure is the evaluation of safety information. There was no specified time frame for this outcome measure, as safety data was being collected until the drug became available for commercial purchase in May 2013.</description>

    <measure>Number of Eyes With a Corneal Cystine Crystal Score (CCCS) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Any Time Point Up to 19 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 1 in Corneal Cystine Crystal Score (CCCS) at any time on study when baseline CCCS is greater than or equal to 1, or CCCS does not increase at least 1 at any time on study when baseline CCCS is less than 1.
The CCCS is based on a library of slit-lamp photographs of corneas with increasing crystal densities (0-3). Slit-lamp photos were to be taken to assess the extent of the corneal crystal accumulation. To minimize bias when assessing the extent of corneal crystal accumulation, photos were centrally graded at the National Eye Institute (NEI) where each photo was graded independently by masked graders. If more than one CCCS was recorded in a given study year, the highest (worst) CCCS value was used for that year.
The results were obtained from a combined analyses of the NIH cysteamine studies evaluating various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulations from 1986 through 2005.</description>

          <title>Number of Eyes With a Corneal Cystine Crystal Score (CCCS) Response</title>
          <description>Response is defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 1 in Corneal Cystine Crystal Score (CCCS) at any time on study when baseline CCCS is greater than or equal to 1, or CCCS does not increase at least 1 at any time on study when baseline CCCS is less than 1.
The CCCS is based on a library of slit-lamp photographs of corneas with increasing crystal densities (0-3). Slit-lamp photos were to be taken to assess the extent of the corneal crystal accumulation. To minimize bias when assessing the extent of corneal crystal accumulation, photos were centrally graded at the National Eye Institute (NEI) where each photo was graded independently by masked graders. If more than one CCCS was recorded in a given study year, the highest (worst) CCCS value was used for that year.
The results were obtained from a combined analyses of the NIH cysteamine studies evaluating various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulations from 1986 through 2005.</description>
          <population>One hundred sixty-one (161) participants were analyzed in the pre-specified intent-to-treat population [defined as patients who received study medication (between 1986 and 2005), and had a baseline and a post-baseline CCCS value]. After 2005, all participants enrolled received open-label treatment and only safety data was obtained.</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout the study. No specified time period is noted, as participants were followed until the drug became available commercially.</time_frame>
      <desc>Cystinosis patients typically have multiple medical problems, including kidney failure. The AEs reported do not reflect these systemic problems, focusing instead on ocular AEs (e.g., renal failure is noted in only 2 of 328 patients, though the majority have been managed for kidney disease and/or failure and have received a kidney transplant).</desc>
