      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy, onset of clinical anticonvulsant activity, and
      complications of diazepam and lorazepam given intravenously as prehospital therapy to
      patients in status epilepticus.

      II. Determine the effect of prehospital therapy on the incidence of status epilepticus at the
      subsequent emergency department admission.

      III. Establish whether prehospital therapy alters hospital management of these patients and
      ultimately affects patient outcome.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified by center.

      Patients en route to the hospital in a San Francisco Department of Health Paramedic Division
      ambulance are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Informed consent is waived due to
      impaired consciousness.

      Patients receive intravenous diazepam, lorazepam, or placebo during transport. The patient is
      re-treated if the seizure is sustained after the first dose or recurs after the first dose
      without the patient regaining consciousness.

      Upon arrival at the hospital, all patients receive the standard status epilepticus treatment
      in use at that site.
