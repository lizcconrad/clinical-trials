      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from donated tumor cells treated with interferon alfa may make the
      body build an immune response to and kill pancreatic tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Colony-stimulating factors may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of
      chemotherapy. Combining these treatments may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy using donated
      tumor cells treated with interferon alfa and radiation therapy and cyclophosphamide plus
      GM-CSF in treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility, toxicity, and antitumor effects of active specific
      intralymphatic immunotherapy with allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells treated with interferon
      alfa plus low-dose adjuvant systemic sargramostim (GM-CSF) and cyclophosphamide in patients
      with incurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Assess the immunologic and biologic correlates
      of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Cultured allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells are incubated with interferon alfa for
      72-96 hours. Autologous cell lines, if established, may be used as an alternative. The cells
      are irradiated immediately prior to use. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -3 and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 0-8. On day 0, patients receive viable tumor
      cells via dorsal pedal lymphatic cannulation. Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for a minimum
      of 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 2-4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
