  <brief_summary>

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy before surgery is more effective
      than giving chemotherapy plus radiation therapy after surgery in treating patients with
      rectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy given before surgery
      to see how well it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy given after surgery
      in treating patients with rectal cancer that can be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare local recurrence free rates and quality of life in patients with operable rectal
           cancer receiving preoperative radiotherapy versus patients receiving selective
           postoperative chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine local recurrence free survival, overall survival, time to appearance of
           distant metastases, disease free survival and morbidity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by a number of
      factors including surgeon.

      Patients are randomized to receive preoperative radiotherapy (arm I) or postoperative
      chemoradiotherapy (arm II).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 1 week prior to surgery.
           Patients undergo surgery within 7 days of the last fraction of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy 4-12 weeks after surgery (if circumferential
           resection margins are histologically involved by tumor). Radiotherapy is administered in
           25 fractions over 5 weeks (5 days per week). During radiotherapy, patients either
           receive fluorouracil (5-FU) continuous infusion, 5-FU bolus IV and leucovorin calcium IV
           weekly, or a 5-day bolus schedule of 5-FU and leucovorin calcium.

      Patients may then receive adjuvant chemotherapy as per local policy.

      Quality of life assessments are made every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for
      the next 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1800 patients will be accrued into this study.
