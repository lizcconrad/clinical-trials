      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CI-1012 in late-stage HIV-1-infected patients. To
      determine the antiretroviral activity of CI-1012 when added to combination therapy. To assess
      the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic characteristics of CT-1012 when added to combination
      therapy. To assess the effect of CI-1012 on the pharmacokinetics of other antiretroviral
      agents.

      Doses are escalated based on safety assessments: As soon as a dose meets the criteria for
      &quot;tolerated&quot; or &quot;not tolerated&quot;, doses are escalated or terminated, respectively. All patients
      are treated for 2 weeks, with follow-up visits scheduled 1 week and 1 month post-treatment.
