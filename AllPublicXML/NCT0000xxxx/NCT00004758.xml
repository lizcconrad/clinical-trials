      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of surgical resection of an identifiable zone of
      cortical abnormality versus multiple drug therapy in children with infantile spasms
      refractory to standard therapy.

      II. Assess how infantile spasms interfere with development and whether this is partially
      reversible.

      III. Determine the predictors of good surgical outcome and whether surgery permanently
      controls seizures and improves development.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups. The first group undergoes sequential antiepileptic therapy with pyridoxine,
      corticotropin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and nitrazepam. The sequence of administration
      may be altered based on drugs taken prior to entry. Any drug may be omitted due to medical
      contraindications or prior use at study doses or higher.

      The second group undergoes surgical resection of the zone of cortical abnormality. A
      functional hemispherectomy is performed for hemiparesis or diffuse unihemispheric
      dysfunction.

      If seizures are controlled in the first group at 3 months, the current medication is
      maintained; if seizures are not controlled, sequential therapy continues to completion.
      Patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 6 months cross to surgery.

      Surgical patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 3 months or persistent seizures after
      taper of pre-study antiepileptics cross to drug therapy.

      All patients are followed at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        Disease Characteristics

          -  Infantile spasms or seizures with diagnosis based on the following: short muscular
             contractions leading to flexion or extension; Single or repetitive
             electroencephalogram (EEG) consistent with diagnosis, i.e., hypsarrhythmia, modified
             hypsarrhythmia, multifocal spike and wave abnormalities; developmental quotient less
             than 70

          -  Zone of cortical abnormality in 1 lobe, contiguous multilobes, or 1 hemisphere;
             confirmed by historical, neurological, and physical evidence, including EEG, closed
             circuit televised EEG, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or
             positron-emission tomography; at least 2 abnormal test/imaging results required

          -  No treatable seizure etiology such as metabolic disease or infection

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy

          -  Failed standard therapy, i.e., refractory to corticotropin (at least 40 IU/day for 14
             days) as follows: persistent infantile spasms OR recurrent spasms after
             discontinuation or taper OR complications requiring dose modification

          -  At least 1 month of standard antiepileptic drug with documented therapeutic blood
             levels

        Patient Characteristics

          -  No medical contraindication to surgery

          -  English-speaking family
