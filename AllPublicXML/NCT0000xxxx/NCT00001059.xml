  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ( DOX-SL ) alone
      or in combination with bleomycin and vincristine in the long-term treatment of AIDS-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma. To determine whether the 3-drug combination enhances progression-free
      survival and quality of life.

      Liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents increase drug accumulation in tumors, which
      permits disease palliation at relatively low doses and thus decreases some of the
      dose-limiting toxicity. Multi-agent therapy is considered to be more effective than
      single-agent therapy; therefore, DOX-SL will be combined with bleomycin and vincristine.

      Liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents increase drug accumulation in tumors, which
      permits disease palliation at relatively low doses and thus decreases some of the
      dose-limiting toxicity. Multi-agent therapy is considered to be more effective than
      single-agent therapy; therefore, DOX-SL will be combined with bleomycin and vincristine.

      Patients are randomized to receive intravenous DOX-SL alone or in combination with
      vincristine/bleomycin every 2 weeks. Filgrastim ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor;
      G-CSF ) may be given as needed for neutropenia.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 11/7/96: Based on interim review data, it is recommended that subjects
      receiving DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin have vincristine/bleomycin discontinued and
      receive DOX-SL alone unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, they are benefitting
      from the DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin regimen.
