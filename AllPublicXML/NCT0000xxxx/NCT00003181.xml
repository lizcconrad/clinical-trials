      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill
      cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF may be a more effective
      treatment for kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose interleukin-2, vinblastine,
      and GM-CSF in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) in combination with interleukin-2 and vinblastine on the
      response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Assess the potential
      toxicities of this treatment combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized study. Patients receive vinblastine as an IV
      bolus once every 2 weeks. Interleukin-2 is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5
      each week for 9 weeks. Sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
      GM-CSF) is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Each 9
      week cycle is followed by 3 weeks of rest. Patient may continue treatment for a maximum of 5
      cycles in the absence of disease progression. Patients are assessed every 12 weeks for the
      duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-35 patients will be accrued into this study.
