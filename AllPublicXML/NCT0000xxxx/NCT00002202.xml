  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if 141W94 is as safe and effective as indinavir when used
      with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for 48 weeks. This study also
      examines what effect other drugs have on how the body handles 141W94.
