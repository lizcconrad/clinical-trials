  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the relative antiviral activity and safety of zidovudine ( AZT ) and didanosine
      ( ddI ) alone and in combination, as well as in various sequences of administration.

      The relative efficacy of the approved antiretrovirals in early HIV-1 disease is unclear;
      thus, a study is needed to evaluate the ability of these various nucleoside analogs to limit
      pathogenicity.

      The relative efficacy of the approved antiretrovirals in early HIV-1 disease is unclear;
      thus, a study is needed to evaluate the ability of these various nucleoside analogs to limit
      pathogenicity.

      Patients undergo observation for 2 weeks, then are randomized to one of six treatment arms to
      receive ddI alone or in sequence or combination with AZT for 16-32 weeks, followed by 4 weeks
      of post-treatment evaluation. The regimens are: ddI alone for 32 weeks; AZT for 16 weeks
      followed by ddI for 16 weeks; AZT for 16 weeks followed by AZT/ddI combination for 16 weeks;
      ddI for 16 weeks followed by AZT for 16 weeks; AZT/ddI combination for 32 weeks; and placebo
      for 32 weeks.

      PER AMENDMENT 6/18/96: NOTE: Patients enrolled under version 3 of the study will terminate
      treatment at week 16 and have a 4 week follow up.
