  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the toxic effects of AS-101 at various doses in patients with AIDS or AIDS
      related complex. Also to determine the effect of various doses of AS-101 on immune functions
      and the occurrence of infections in these patients. AIDS is a viral disease that is
      characterized by a loss of some immune function and the development of frequent, eventually
      fatal, infectious diseases. Although zidovudine (AZT) has prolonged survival in some patients
      with AIDS, AZT is quite toxic and there is a need for more effective and less toxic drugs.
      AS-101 is a synthetic organic compound containing the metal tellurium that is being tested
      because in laboratory studies it improved immune functions.

      AIDS is a viral disease that is characterized by a loss of some immune function and the
      development of frequent, eventually fatal, infectious diseases. Although zidovudine (AZT) has
      prolonged survival in some patients with AIDS, AZT is quite toxic and there is a need for
      more effective and less toxic drugs. AS-101 is a synthetic organic compound containing the
      metal tellurium that is being tested because in laboratory studies it improved immune
      functions.

      Patients are given intravenous infusions of AS-101 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The first
      group of 6 patients receives a dose that did not cause toxic effects in a preliminary study.
      If no adverse effects occur, the next 6 patients receive a higher dose level and so on, until
      an optimum dose has been reached. The investigators will determine the optimum dose based on
      the type and severity of adverse effects experienced by the patients on the study and by the
      effect of the drug on the immune function of the patient and its effect on the HIV infection.
      Samples of blood and urine are taken periodically during the study and skin tests are
      performed 3 times to aid in the evaluation of AS-101. Patients receive standard treatment for
      any infections that develop during the study.
