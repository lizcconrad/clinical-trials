  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Refractory or Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
      provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston
      therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Refractory or Recurrent
      High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Refractory or Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      Refractory or Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients receive
      gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
      until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to12 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory or
           Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as measured by an objective
           response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Refractory or Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients with Refractory or Recurrent High-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically proven stage II, III, or IV high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has
             not responded to, or has relapsed after a standard primary chemotherapy regimen plus
             at least 1 standard second-line salvage chemotherapy regimen NOTE: A new
             classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adoptedby PDQ. The
             terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology
             of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the
             former terminology.
