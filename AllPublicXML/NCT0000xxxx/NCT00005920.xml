  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give L-743,872 to patients
      with thrush, an AIDS-related yeast infection of the mouth, that has not been cured with
      fluconazole treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to treatment with L-743,872 at one of two doses administered
      intravenously by a peripheral line once-daily. Patients are treated for 48 hours beyond
      resolution of symptoms or for a maximum of 14 days. Each patient is expected to complete the
      study, including the 14-day follow-up, within approximately 4 weeks. A physical examination
      is performed daily during the antifungal treatment period and at the follow-up visits 7 and
      14 days post-therapy. Laboratory tests of blood and urine for safety are performed every
      three days during treatment and at follow-up 7 days post-therapy. Liver enzymes are drawn at
      the 14-day follow-up visit.
