      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have advanced or recurrent lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody HuM291 in patients with
           advanced or recurrent CD3+ T-cell lymphomas.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this treatment regimen in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine the response in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuM291 IV over 3 hours on days 1-4 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial response, complete response with
      recurrence, or stable disease may receive further therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HuM291 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
