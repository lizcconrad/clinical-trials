      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of gene transfer into the nasal epithelium
      using Ad5-CB-CFTR, an E1-deleted adenovirus vector containing the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator gene, in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

      II. Determine whether ion transport abnormalities in CF airway cells can be corrected.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Groups of 3 patients receive 1 of 4 doses of Ad5-CB-CFTR, a recombinant E1-deleted adenovirus
      serotype 5 vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.
      Ad5-CB-CFTR is administered to 1 nasal cavity and the vehicle alone is administered to the
      opposite nasal cavity as the control.
