      RATIONALE: Capsaicin lozenges may be effective treatment for mucositis caused by radiation
      therapy. It is not yet known whether capsaicin lozenges are more effective than no treatment
      for mucositis caused by radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of capsaicin lozenges in
      treating patients with mucositis caused by radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of capsaicin lozenges in terms of frequency, duration,
      and severity of mouth pain caused by radiation therapy to the oral cavity. II. Evaluate the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to dentures (yes vs no), smoking history (none vs currently vs past
      only), radiation therapy (primary vs postoperative adjuvant), planned radiation dose
      (5000-6000 cGy vs greater than 6000 cGy), planned fluoride use (yes vs no), and amount of
      oral mucosa in radiation field (one- to two-thirds vs greater than two-thirds). Patients
      receive one lozenge orally of capsaicin or placebo four times daily. Treatment begins within
      the first 3 days of radiation therapy and continues during and for two weeks after radiation
      therapy is completed.
