      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the relationship between genotype variations and clinical phenotype in patients
      with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: A detailed family history is obtained from all participants. Whenever
      possible, standard growth curves of affected children are obtained.

      Participants then undergo clinical studies of antidiuretic function. A standard fluid
      deprivation-vasopressin challenge is performed with timed measurements of osmolality,
      electrolytes, creatinine, and vasopressin. The next day, blood pressure, plasma cyclic AMP,
      GMP, von Willebrand Factor, Factor VIII, and urine osmolality are measured during a water
      load desamino-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) infusion test.

      Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of congenital diabetes insipidus are then treated
      with chlorothiazide. Daily urine volume and osmolality are determined before and after
      therapy. Sodium and fluid are not restricted.

      For each family, the entire vasopressin V2 gene of at least 1 affected male, and where
      possible at least 1 obligate carrier and 1 unaffected brother of a patient is sequenced. In
      addition, a detailed Xq28 haplotype analysis is done to identify the origin of de novo
      mutations. If no mutation is found and the disorder is not transmitted in an X-linked mode,
      both alleles of the gene that codes for aquaporin-II are also sequenced. DNA is collected by
      mail from as many kindred as possible who do not participate in the clinical studies.
