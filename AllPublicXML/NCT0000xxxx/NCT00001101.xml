  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States. It is caused by the
      spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. It may exist in a chronic form and be the result of: 1)
      active infection by B. burgdorferi; 2) damage caused by the original infectious process; or
      3) the presence of co-infection with another organism transmitted by Ixodes ticks. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness, for seropositive
      patients, of intensive antibiotic treatment in eliminating symptoms of Chronic Lyme Disease
      (CLD).

      One hundred ninety-four (194) patients will be enrolled in this study. Each patient will be
      assigned to one of two groups and will be randomly selected to receive either antibiotic
      therapy or placebo; but, the assignment of medication will not be made known to the patient
      or administering doctor. Antibiotic or placebo will be given intravenously (IV) for 30
      consecutive days and then orally for the next 60 consecutive days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        You may be eligible for this study if you:

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Are seropositive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens by Western Blot at
             enrollment.

          -  Have documented history of acute Lyme disease.

          -  Have had a rash (erythema migrans) that resembles a bullseye. This skin aberration
             usually occurs after a tick bite in late spring, summer or early fall and is sometimes
             accompanied by fatigue, fever, headache, mild stiff neck, arthralgia or myalgia.

          -  Have had one or more clinical features typical of Lyme disease acquired in the United
             States (see technical summary).

          -  Have had one or more of the following symptoms and conditions that have persisted for
             at least 6 months (but less than 12 years) and are not attributable to another cause
             or condition: a) widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue that began coincident
             with or within 6 months following initial infection with B. burgdorferi. b) certain
             neurologic symptoms including memory impairment and nerve pain within 6 months
             following initial infection with B. burgdorferi.

          -  Have had a physician-documented history of prior antibiotic treatment with a currently
             recommended antibiotic regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        You will not be eligible for this study if you:

          -  Have previously enrolled in this study.

          -  Are pregnant, lactating, or unable to use birth control measures during the treatment
             period of this study.

          -  Are taking chronic medication that could interfere with evaluation of symptoms.

          -  Are taking or have taken various medications that could interfere with the evaluation
             of symptoms (see technical summary).

          -  Are hypersensitive to ceftriaxone or doxycycline.

          -  Have active inflammatory synovitis.

          -  Have another disease that could account for symptoms of acute Lyme disease.

          -  Have another serious disease or an active infection.

          -  Are unable to tolerate an IV.

          -  Have tested positive for Borrelia DNA in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid at the time of
             initial evaluation for study.
