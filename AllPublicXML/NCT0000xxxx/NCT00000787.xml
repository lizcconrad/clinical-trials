      PRIMARY: To identify factors associated with risk of HIV infection through heterosexual
      activity among urban, inner-city women.

      SECONDARY: To identify correlates of high-risk behaviors in order to provide a basis for
      future intervention studies.

    <textblock>
      At baseline and at 6-month intervals, participants are interviewed about their sexual
      behavior, drug and alcohol-related behaviors, and recent medical history, and are given a
      psychosocial assessment. They also undergo a physical exam, including pelvic exam and
      colposcopy, and have blood and urine specimens collected for HIV testing, drug screening, and
      STD evaluation. Additionally, participants are given pre- and post-test counseling and
      education, including information about social services. They are provided with basic
      gynecological care and either treatment or referral for medical problems.
