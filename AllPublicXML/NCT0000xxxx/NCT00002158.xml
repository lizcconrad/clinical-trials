  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if nitazoxanide (NTZ) can be used to treat AIDS patients
      suffering from cryptosporidiosis (diarrhea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium).

    <textblock>
      Patients receive oral nitazoxanide daily for 14 days, after which those with complete
      clinical and parasitologic response discontinue treatment. Non-responders and partial
      responders may continue therapy for an additional 14 days at the discretion of the physician.
      Non-responders who show signs of improvement or who have partial response after 28 days and
      those who relapse following complete response may continue therapy for an additional month,
      up to 60 days total. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/96: Patients receive a daily treatment for 4
      weeks, with subsequent dose escalation in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Patients who
      exhibit complete response after 2 months may continue at a maintenance dose. Patients
      enrolled after October 15, 1996 are randomized to 1 of 2 doses, with subsequent escalations
      made in the absence of toxicity. Complete responders may continue therapy at a maintenance
      dose and duration determined by the investigator. Non-responders after 6 months of therapy
      have treatment discontinued.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/5/97: All patients are evaluated at Weeks
      1, 2, 4, and monthly thereafter.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/17/99: New patients start therapy on a
      different dosage of nitazoxanide. Those who do not respond after 4 weeks of therapy will
      escalate to a higher dosage. Patients who show a complete response at 2 consecutive visits (2
      weeks apart) discontinue nitazoxanide therapy and go to follow-up.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/3/00:
      The Week 1 clinical evaluation is deleted from the study procedures.]
