  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop better methods of diagnosis, localization, and treatment
      for pheochromocytomas. These tumors, which usually arise from the adrenal glands, are often
      difficult to detect with current methods. Pheochromocytomas release chemicals called
      catecholamines, causing high blood pressure. Undetected, the tumors can lead to severe
      medical consequences, including stroke, heart attack and sudden death, in situations that
      would normally pose little or no risk, such as surgery, general anesthesia or childbirth.

      Patients with pheochromocytoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened
      with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine
      tests. Study participants will undergo blood, urine, and imaging tests, described below, to
      detect pheochromocytoma. If a tumor is found, the patient will be offered surgery. If surgery
      is not feasible (for example, if there are multiple tumors that cannot be removed),
      evaluations will continue in follow-up visits. If the tumor cannot be found, the patient will
      be offered medical treatment and efforts to detect the tumor will continue. Main diagnostic
      and research tests may include the following:

        1. Blood tests - mainly measurements of plasma or urine catecholamines and metanephrines as
           well as methoxytyramine. If necessary the clonidine suppression test can be carried out.

        2. Standard imaging tests - Non-investigational imaging tests include computed tomography
           (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sonography, and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and FDG
           (positron emission tomography) PET/CT. These scans may be done before and/or after
           surgical removal of pheochromocytoma.

        3. Research PET scanning is done using an injection of radioactive compounds. Patients may
           undergo 18F-FDOPA, 18F-DA, as well as 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT . Each scan takes up to about
           2 hours.

        4. Genetic testing - A small blood sample is collected for DNA analysis and other analyses.

      Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare but clinically important chromaffin cell tumors
      that typically arise from the adrenal gland or from extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively
      and constitute a surgically correctable cause of chronic hypertension. The clinical features
      and consequences of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma result from the release of catecholamines
      (e.g., norepinephrine and epinephrine) by the tumor. If a pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is
      undetected, stimuli that normally would not pose a hazard, such as surgery, childbirth, or
      general anesthesia, can evoke catecholamine secretion by the tumor, with clinically
      significant and even catastrophic outcomes. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma
      and its localization can be challenging, because measurements of plasma levels or urinary
      excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites as well as radio-iodinated
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning can yield false-positive/negative results in patients
      harboring the tumor. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lack
      sufficient specificity. The molecular mechanisms by which genotypic changes predispose to the
      development of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma remain unknown, even in patients with
      identified mutations. Moreover, pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas in patients with hereditary
      predispositions differ in terms of their growth, malignant potential, catecholamine
      phenotype, responses to standard screening tests, such as the clonidine suppression test,
      various imaging modalities, and different therapeutic options. This protocol focuses on
      developmental, molecular, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomics, and other types of
      studies to elucidate the bases for predisposition to develop pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas
      and for expression of different neurochemical phenotypes and malignant potentials including
      therapeutic responses. Furthermore, this protocol will also use new imaging approaches, for
      example [(18)F]-6F-dopamine ([(18)F]-6F-DA), [(18)F]-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
      ([(18F)]-DOPA), and [(68)Ga]-DOTA-Tyr-octreotate ([(68)Ga]-DOTATATE) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/CT, as well as PET/MRI scanning, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.
      Additionally, new biochemical diagnostic criteria exist for the measurement of plasma
      metanephrines and methoxytyramine for the clinical diagnosis and localization of these
      tumors. This protocol will also evaluate the benefits of histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g.
      romidepsin) pretreatment for uptake enhancement of [(123/131)I]-MIBG in
      pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumors.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients are adults or children of any age with known, sporadic or familial PHEO/PGL,
             on the basis of one or more of the following:

               1. High levels of blood or urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, methoxytyramine or
                  chromogranin A.

               2. Highly suspected presence of PHEO/PGL based on imaging studies, even with normal
                  biochemistry.

               3. Personal or family history of PHEO/PGL or genetic mutations known to predispose
                  individuals to develop PHEO/PGL.

          -  Normal volunteers over the age of 18 years, including those with normal or high blood
             pressure, are to be used for reference values regarding biochemical and imaging
             diagnosis of PHEO/PGL. Normal volunteers with high blood pressure can be on blood
             pressure medication.

          -  Patients and normal volunteers can be studied to provide blood/urine samples for
             biochemical, proteomic, and/or genetic and epigenetic analysis.

          -  Signed informed consent is required.

          -  Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up evaluation.

          -  Patients must have an outside general practitioner or endocrinologist. Patients with
             metastatic disease must also have an outside oncologist.

          -  Patients with PHEO/PGL will be accepted through clinician or self- referrals.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Potential patients will be excluded on the basis of one or more of the following:

          1. Pregnant (based on a pregnancy test done either outside the NIH or at the NIH) or
             breastfeeding women

          2. Severe cardiac dysfunction

          3. Currently on dialysis

             -A pregnancy test is performed in women of childbearing age (up to age 55). If after
             enrollment to this protocol, a patient is found to have a positive pregnancy test, her
             participation in this protocol will be terminated..

               -  Research scans are contraindicated in patients with proven myelodysplastic
                  syndrome.

               -  Patients who are not willing to return to the NIH (e.g., after surgery or an
                  initial evaluation) for more than 2 years may be removed from the protocol.

               -  Pregnant and lactating women will not be included in the protocol because their
                  participation as a demographic is not essential to this study. The information we
                  are seeking can be acquired from a cohort of non-pregnant patients. The exclusion
                  of pregnant women does not preclude these patients from receiving appropriate
                  care and management from an outside facility.

             SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR IMAGING STUDIES WITHIN OUR PROTOCOL:

             -In adult patients:

             --Imaging studies are not done in patients that have the following exclusion criteria:

             ---Pregnant and lactating women,

             ---Patients with a body weight of (Bullet)400 pounds due to weight limitations of
             PET/CT/MRI scanners or patients who are not able to enter the bore of PET/CT/MRI
             scanners due to BMI,

             Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.),

             ---Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.),

             ---Any additional medical conditions, serious illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may significantly
             interfere with study compliance.

             ---Additionally, DCE-MRI is not done in patients with acute or chronic renal
             insufficiency since gadolinium chelate injection is contraindicated in those patients.
             In patients where DCE-MRI is considered, a creatinine clearance measurement is
             performed as a clinically indicated test by the Department of Laboratory Medicine at
             the NIH Clinical Center. Patients with impaired kidney function will not undergo
             DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI is also not done in patients with severe claustrophobia or who have
             iron or metal in the MRI scan site, in patients with pacemakers or defibrillators, or
             in patients with an allergy to gadolinium. Very rarely, gadolinium at the site of
             injection or the dosed limb can cause skin and soft tissue necrosis, thrombosis,
             fasciitis, and compartment syndrome requiring surgical intervention.

             -In pediatric patients:

             --Inclusion criteria for research PET imaging in children

             ---Children over 10 years old with very high suspicion of sporadic or familial
             pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (e.g. the presence of new onset of hypertension or
             hypertensive episodes, sweating, headaches, pallor, palpitations, drug resistant
             hypertension, etc.) family history of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma or genetic
             mutations known to predispose individuals to develop these tumors, or the presence of
             a tumor on conventional imaging /ultrasounds, CT, MRI.

               -  Children must give written informed assent and be willing to return to the NIH
                  for follow-up.

               -  Female patients of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test on the
                  day of the enrollment into this protocol and within 24 hours of any treatment or
                  test involving radioactivity or radiation exposure. They should be abstinent or
                  use appropriate contraception while taking part in the study, which involves
                  radiation.

                  --Exclusion criteria for research PET imaging in children

               -  Children of less than 10 years of age,

               -  Children with impaired mental capacity that precludes informed assent,

               -  Pregnant or lactating female adolescents,

               -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, turbulent
                  children, severe claustrophobia, etc.).
