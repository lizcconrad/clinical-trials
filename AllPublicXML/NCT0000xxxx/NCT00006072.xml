  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathies cause weakness and sensory loss that can produce severe disability.
      Some neuropathies are immune-mediated and associated with antibodies. It has been postulated
      that Rituxan treatment may reduce the level of antibody production limiting the loss of
      muscle strength and hence improve activities of daily living. The purpose of this open-label
      study (all participants get Rituxan and not placebo) is to determine the safety and
      effectiveness of Rituxan in the treatment of polyneuropathies associated with serum IgM
      autoantibodies in those who have already been treated with one course of Rituxan. Subjects
      will be treated on the in-patient Clinical Research Center with Rituxan for two treatments
      one week a part and then individual treatments every 10 weeks for one year. The effectiveness
      of Rituxan will be followed by looking for increases in muscle strength and decreases in the
      serum IgM autoantibodies.
