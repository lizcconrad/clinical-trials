      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not responded to fludarabine or alkylating agents.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the anticancer efficacy of 506U78 in patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia refractory to fludarabine and alkylator therapy. II. Determine the
      safety (including incidence of infection) of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of 506U78 and ara-G, and assess the intracellular pharmacokinetics of
      ara-GTP in patients receiving multiple treatment courses (at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
      only). IV. Determine the response rate, time to maximal response, and duration of response in
      patients treated with this drug. V. Determine two-year survival and progression-free survival
      of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cellular type of
      disease (B cell vs T cell). Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 2
      months for 2 years until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-100 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia Evidence of
        active disease after fludarabine or alkylator therapy Must meet one or more of the
        following criteria for active disease: Minimum of one of the following disease-related
        symptoms: Weight loss of 10% or more within the previous 6 months Extreme fatigue (e.g.,
        unable to work or perform usual activities) Fevers greater than 100.5 degrees F for 2 weeks
        or more without evidence of infection Night sweats without evidence of infection Evidence
        of progressive marrow failure manifested by the development or worsening of autoimmune
        anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroid therapy Massive
        (e.g., greater than 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive splenomegaly Massive
        nodes or clusters (e.g., greater than 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive
        lymphadenopathy Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month
        period or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months Ineligible if marked
        hypogammaglobulinemia or development of monoclonal protein in the absence of the above
        criteria for active disease Must have one of the following resulting from prior fludarabine
        or alkylator-containing therapy: Disease progression during therapy Failure to respond or
        obtained less than a partial response to therapy Disease progression within 6 months of the
        last course of therapy after an initial response Failure to respond or disease progression
        allowed at any time after the final dose if alkylator agent was not the most recent therapy

        2 or higher No history of significant neurologic toxicity (grade 2 or greater motor or
        sensory impairment) due to prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy No history of seizure
        disorder No active infection No other malignancy within the past 2 years (except adequately
        treated non- melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ) that would preclude study No
        systemic nonmalignant comorbid disease that would preclude study No psychological,
        sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude study

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
        cell transplantation Recovered from prior immunotherapy At least 4 weeks since prior
        biologic therapy and recovered Concurrent growth factors allowed Chemotherapy: See Disease
        Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
        mitomycin) and recovered No prior 506U78 therapy No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine
        therapy: See Disease Characteristics No concurrent corticosteroid therapy greater than 10
        mg/day of prednisone equivalent No concurrent corticosteroids as antiemetics Concurrent
        hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives allowed Concurrent hydrocortisone as
