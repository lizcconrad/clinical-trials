      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of two doses of folic acid in normalizing plasma total
      homocysteine concentration in patients with end stage renal disease receiving regular
      hemodialysis therapy resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia.

      II. Determine the requirement of co-supplementation with extra pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and
      cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) daily in these patients.

      III. Assess the safety and tolerability of this therapy in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified
      according to prestudy homocysteine levels (above or below average). Patients are randomized
      to receive placebo or one of two doses of oral folic acid, with or without pyridoxine and
      cyanocobalamin.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Arm II: Patients receive oral pyridoxine,
      cyanocobalamin, and oral placebo daily.

      Arm III: Patients receive oral pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid daily.

      Arm IV: Patients receive oral pyridoxine and cyanocobalamin plus a higher dose of folic acid
      daily.

      Arm V: Patients receive oral placebo and oral folic acid daily. Arm VI: Patients receive oral
      placebo and higher dose folic acid daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks.
