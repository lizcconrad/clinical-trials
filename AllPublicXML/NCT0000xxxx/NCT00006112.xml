      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil with or
      without mitomycin in treating patients who have peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of adjuvant systemic fluorouracil with intraperitoneal
      mitomycin vs systemic fluorouracil alone in terms of survival in patients with peritoneal
      cancer originating from the colorectum.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center
      and mode of surgery. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      undergo complete resection of tumor on day 0. Patients then receive mitomycin
      intraperitoneally (IP) over 23 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IP over 24 hours on days 2-5.
      Patients then receive one of three systemic chemotherapy regimens for 6 months: Regimen I:
      Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days
      1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks. Regimen II: Patients receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously for 7 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks. Regimen III: Leucovorin calcium
      and fluorouracil are administered as per standard procedure. Arm II: Patients receive
      treatment as in arm I but without early intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 90 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
