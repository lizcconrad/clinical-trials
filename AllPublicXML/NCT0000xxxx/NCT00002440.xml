  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give 1592U89 plus certain
      protease inhibitors (PIs) to HIV-infected patients who never have been treated with anti-HIV
      drugs. This study also examines how the body processes these drugs when they are given
      together.

    <textblock>
      In this Phase II, open-label study patients (16 per treatment group) are randomized to
      receive 1592U89 in combination with one of five protease inhibitors: indinavir, saquinavir,
      ritonavir, nelfinavir, or 141W94 for up to 48 weeks.
