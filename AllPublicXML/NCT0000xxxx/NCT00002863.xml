      RATIONALE: Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      cryosurgery with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery with or without chemotherapy
      in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and morbidity associated with cryosurgical ablation in
      patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo 1 session of cryoablation. Patients with high-grade sarcoma
      receive systemic chemotherapy 10-14 days after cryoablation at the discretion of the
      consulting medical oncologist, and undergo surgery 2-3 weeks following chemotherapy. Patients
      with low-grade sarcoma and those with high-grade sarcoma who do not receive chemotherapy
      undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after cryoablation. Surgery for all patients consists of en bloc
      resection or amputation, with limb salvage attempted when feasible. Patients are followed
      weekly for 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (approximately 6 patients with low-grade, high-risk
      sarcoma and 6 with high-grade sarcoma) will be entered over approximately 6 months. The study
      will be suspended for the following: vascular complication that requires surgical
      intervention for correction in 2 patients; any neuropraxia that shows no evidence of
      resolution after 3 months in 2 patients; any wound complication that requires surgical
      correction in 4 patients; or any deep wound infection that requires surgical drainage in 4
      patients.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Biopsy-proven soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremity Review by
        Pathology Department of the University of Southern California CT or MRI required prior to
        biopsy Disease in one of the following categories: High-grade tumor Low-grade tumor at high
        risk for local recurrence, i.e.: Adjacent to bone or vital neurovascular structures and
        able to be removed with a minimal surgical margin (i.e., plane of dissection goes through
        reactive zone of tumor) Lesion more than 5 cm in diameter The following tumors exclude:
        Primary sarcoma of the bone Metastatic carcinoma STS of the head and neck Visceral STS,
        e.g., breast, uterus, spermatic cord, mediastinum chest wall STS of the pelvis or
        retroperitoneum
