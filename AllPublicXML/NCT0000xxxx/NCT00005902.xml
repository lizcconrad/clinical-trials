    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the growth of brain and spinal cord tumors
      and cysts that develop in association with them in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.
      It will examine how fast the tumors grow and try to determine what factors (for example,
      puberty , pregnancy, menopause, blood proteins, etc.) affect their growth.

      Patients between the ages of 8 and 75 years who are enrolled in NIH s study of von
      Hippel-Lindau disease may be eligible for this 5-year study. Participants will have magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord and a thorough neurological history and
      examination at the start of the study. A blood sample will be taken for analysis of factors
      (hormones or other proteins) that may predict tumor growth. Follow-up clinic visits every 6
      months will include a physical and neurological examination, blood tests, and MRI scans of
      the brain and spine. If symptoms or tumor growth requires more frequent follow-up, scans will
      be done at 3-month intervals.

      Surgical removal of brain and spinal cord tumors is currently the treatment of choice when
      these lesions cause neurological problems. A better understanding of which tumors are likely
      to grow and which will remain stable may help guide physicians in treatment decisions and
      avoid unnecessary procedures.

    <textblock>
      Hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord are frequent tumors in
      patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Rarely, these lesions also affect the
      cerebrum. Patients often have multiple lesions, many of which are associated with cysts or
      syrinx. The current treatment for symptomatic lesions is surgical resection. Focused
      radiation is also being used in selected cases in an attempt to provide tumor control. The
      natural history of central nervous system (CNS) lesions in patients with VHL has not been
      addressed in a prospective study. It is not clear at which point these lesions will begin to
      grow, or develop cysts in the cerebellum or syrinx in the spinal cord, and systemic factors
      that influence tumor growth have not been identified. By identifying factors that predict or
      influence tumor progression or cyst development, we can more accurately recommend surgical or
      medical intervention at appropriate times and avoid unnecessary treatment for stable lesions.
      This study will collect prospective radiological and clinical data on growth of the central
      nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas and associated cysts. We will also prospectively
      collect information on systemic processes that may influence tumor progression, such as
      puberty, menopause, pregnancy, effects of hormone therapy, tumor load, serum VEGF levels,
      hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and erythropoietin.
