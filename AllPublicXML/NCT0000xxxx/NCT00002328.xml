        hydration may receive IV azithromycin after approval by the clinical monitor. Patients
        whose disease worsens despite a minimum of 2 weeks of oral therapy or patients whose
        disease shows no improvement after 4 weeks of oral therapy will also be considered for a
        trial period of intravenous azithromycin.

          -  Eligibility and current treatment at a medical center performing study 066-143,
             another study of azithromycin for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients.
