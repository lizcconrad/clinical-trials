      This is a trial to test whether treadmill training can be used to improve the &quot;walking&quot; of
      patients with partial spinal cord injury. While on the treadmill, patients will be partially
      supported through the use of a specially designed harness attached to an overhead lift (also
      called Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training, BWSTT). Patients who enroll in this study
      will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which receives 12 weeks of this
      specialized treadmill training with regular physical therapy, or to the control group, which
      receives 12 weeks regular physical therapy. The ability of the patients to &quot;walk&quot; will be
      measured before and after treatment as well as 6 and 12 months later, using standard tests
      that examine mobility independence and speed of ambulation. The trial takes place across five
      sites in the US and Canada. Patients eligible for this trial will have had a traumatic spinal
      cord injury within 8 weeks of trial entry.

      This is a 5-site randomized clinical trial of a task-oriented locomotor intervention for
      acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The intervention, body weight-supported treadmill training
      (BWSTT), partially supports the weight of the patient via an overhead lift attached to a
      harness. Therapists train the patient to walk on a treadmill by correcting gait deviations
      and manipulating sensory input that enhance control of the stance and swing phases of walking
      at increasingly higher speeds and less weight support. 100 patients with incomplete SCI (from
      below C4 to T10/11) and 100 patients with lesions at T12 to L3 will be randomly assigned to
      12 weeks of conventional therapy programs for mobility versus the same intensity and duration
      of a combination of conventional therapy plus BWSTT. The primary outcome measures are the
      level of independence for ambulation and the maximal speed for walking 50 feet. Patients will
      be tested by masked examiners before and after the 12 weeks of therapy, and 6 and 12 months
      after entry into the study.
