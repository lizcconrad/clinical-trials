      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have recurrent or refractory acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia,
      lymphoma, or myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of arsenic trioxide on the remission rate in patients
      with recurrent or refractory acute leukemia, blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia,
      myelodysplasia, lymphoma, or myeloma. II. Determine the time to progression and survival in
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into 1 of 8 categories: first relapse no greater than 6
      months after complete response vs second relapse or refractory vs prior hematologic disorder
      vs myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia vs lymphoid leukemia vs lymphoma vs
      myeloma vs myelodysplasia. Patients receive IV arsenic trioxide over 2-3 hours for 5
      consecutive days with 2 days of rest. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression until complete response or 90 days is reached. Upon achieving complete response,
      treatment is discontinued for 30 days. Patients exhibiting complete response receive a second
      28 day course of consolidation therapy while in remission starting no sooner than 31 days
      after the end of induction therapy. Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients per lymphoma and myeloma stratum and a total of
      31 patients per leukemia stratum will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
