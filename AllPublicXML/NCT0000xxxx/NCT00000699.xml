  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of treatment with ribavirin (RBV) plus isoprinosine
      (INPX) in preventing the development of AIDS in patients infected with the AIDS virus (HIV).
      Also to determine the maximal dose of RBV that can be tolerated by HIV-infected patients when
      RBV is given with INPX. The patients may or may not have generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome
      (LAS). RBV has prevented the development of AIDS in some HIV-infected patients with LAS and
      INPX has stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights
      infections in the human body, and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the
      immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that
      clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients, but there is no reliable information
      on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients.

      RBV has prevented the development of AIDS in some HIV-infected patients with LAS and INPX has
      stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights
      infections in the human body, and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the
      immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that
      clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients, but there is no reliable information
      on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients.

      All patients take INPX capsules 4 times a day and RBV capsules 2 or 3 times a day. The first
      group of patients take the dose of RBV shown to be effective in an earlier trial and
      subsequent groups take higher doses until toxic effects occur. The planned treatment period
      is 3 months, but further treatment may be allowed for patients showing improvement. Blood
      samples are taken from an arm vein and used to evaluate possible changes in the patient's
      immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the blood and possible changes in
      the presence of HIV in the blood.

        Allowed:

          -  Systemic medications not listed in the Exclusion Concurrent Medications field
             considered necessary for the patient's medical management and which would not
             interfere with the study may be used, but such use must be documented.

          -  Any other medication felt to be immunomodulatory or felt to exhibit significant
             hepatotoxicity or hematologic or renal toxicity by study investigators.
