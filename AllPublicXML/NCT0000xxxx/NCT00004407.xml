      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on recovery time of
      patients with proximal diabetic neuropathy.

      II. Determine whether rate of response is dose dependent in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to treatment with low dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), high dose IVIg, or
      placebo.

      Patients must first complete baseline evaluation. Patients receive IVIg or placebo on days 1,
      2, 3, and 5, biweekly at weeks 2-4, weekly at weeks 5-8, and every other week at weeks 9-12.

      Patients are assessed at 6, 12, 36, 52, and 104 weeks.
