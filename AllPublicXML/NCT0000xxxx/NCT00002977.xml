      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan and thiotepa followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with stage III or stage IV
      epithelial ovarian cancer in complete remission.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxic effects of combined high dose melphalan and thiotepa
      chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue in patients with stage III or IV ovarian epithelial
      cancer in complete remission. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of thiotepa that can
      be given with melphalan in these patients. III. Evaluate the interpatient blood level
      variability and pharmacokinetics of melphalan given intravenously.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of thiotepa. Patients receive cytoreduction and
      mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) with filgrastim (G-CSF) and
      cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide/etoposide or
      cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin within 30-90 days of last dose of standard therapy. PBSC
      are then collected. Patients then receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -6 and -5 and
      thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. G-CSF is
      administered on days 0-21. Cohorts of 5-15 patients each receive escalating doses of thiotepa
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is determined as the dose at which
      2-5 of 4-15 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 100 days,
      then at 6, 12, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
