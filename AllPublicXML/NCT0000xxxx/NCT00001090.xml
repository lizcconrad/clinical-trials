      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of live recombinant canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 in
      combination with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      at 80 microg and 250 microg. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99: To study the safety of following 4
      ALVAC immunizations with a nucleic acid gag/pol HIV-1 immunogen (APL-400-047, Wyeth-Lederle).
      To assess the ability of this sequence of immunization to boost the LTL, T-helper cell, and
      antibody response.] ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccines have induced HIV-specific CTL responses in
      more than half of recipients in some protocols. Depending on the HIV-1 gene products
      expressed by the particular ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccine, volunteers have generated
      anti-Envelope (vCP125, vCP205, and vCP300), anti-Gag (vCP205 and vCP300), and anti-Nef
      (vCP300) CTL activity. Although 3 to 4 immunizations with the different ALVAC-HIV
      experimental vaccines induce anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a portion, often the
      majority, of volunteers, the geometric mean titers of these antibodies are modest, usually
      less than 50. This study will determine whether there is an increase in the anti-HIV antibody
      titers when GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant with ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and will also examine the
      kinetics and magnitude of the HIV-specific CTL response.

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV
      vCP205 at 10^6.3 TCID50 or placebo and GM-CSF or placebo by intramuscular injection at Months
      0, 1, 3, and 6 as follows:

      Group A: vCP205 plus GM-CSF placebo (10 volunteers) Group B: vCP205 plus 80 microg GM-CSF (10
      volunteers) Group C: vCP205 plus 250 microg GM-CSF (10 volunteers) Group D: vcP205 placebo
      plus GM-CSF placebo (6 volunteers). [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/30/99: Boosting with APL-400-047
      HIV-1 gag/pol DNA is added for volunteers who have received all scheduled immunization in the
      original protocol. Volunteers in Groups A, B, and C will receive booster intramuscular
      injections of DNA vaccine at Months 0 and 1, those in Group D will receive DNA control
      (bupivacaine carrier alone) at Months 0 and 1].

        Inclusion Criteria

        Volunteers must have:

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV within 8 weeks prior to immunization.

          -  CD4 count of 400 cells/mm3 or higher.

          -  Normal history and physical examination.

          -  Viable EBV line prior to initial immunization. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99:
