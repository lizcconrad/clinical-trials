      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of carboplatin plus
      vincristine in treating children and adolescents with low grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Develop a standardized scheme of therapy for children and adolescents with low
      grade glioma. II. Determine the effectiveness of carboplatin and vincristine in treating
      children aged less than 5 years with severe or progressive symptoms or unequivocal imaging
      evidence of tumor growth.

      OUTLINE: A complete resection of tumor is performed on patients with low grade glioma with or
      without neurofibromatosis type 1. Surgery is reconsidered following tumor relapse,
      progression, or clinical deterioration. Every effort is made to obtain a biopsy from patients
      not receiving debulking surgery. Nonoperative patients and postoperative patients who are not
      candidates for second surgery receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Postoperative patients
      receive radiotherapy following surgical wound healing and within 28 days of resection.
      Children less than 5 years old receive chemotherapy first, then radiotherapy if the tumor
      subsequently progresses or recurs. All other patients receive radiotherapy, then
      chemotherapy. The latter treatment is conducted in the presence of tumor progression.
      Chemotherapy is given in 2 parts, first an initial intensive phase (phase 1), then a later
      continuation phase (phase 2). In phase 1, patients receive vincristine IV weekly for 10 weeks
      and carboplatin IV every 3 weeks. In phase 2, patients receive vincristine IV and carboplatin
      IV every 4 weeks for a total treatment time of 52 weeks. Chemotherapy continues until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive radiotherapy daily 5 times a week.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
