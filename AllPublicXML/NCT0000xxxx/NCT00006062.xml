      This is a phase I study of the experimental anticancer drug oxaliplatin. It is designed to
      establish the maximum dose of the drug that can be given safely to patients with cancer who
      have impaired liver function and to determine the drug's side effects. It will also examine
      how liver function affects the drug's elimination from the body. The liver plays an important
      role in the elimination of many anticancer drugs, and patients with impaired liver function
      should not take certain drugs or should take them in reduced doses.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with cancer that has metastasized (spread from the
      original tumor site) and for whom standard treatment is not available or is no longer
      effective may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with various tests and
      procedures that may include physical examination, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans, chest X-rays, and blood and urine tests.

      Participants will be given oxaliplatin in doses determined according to their level of liver
      function. Patients may have normal liver function or mildly, moderately or severely impaired
      liver function, or may have had a liver transplant. Oxaliplatin will be infused intravenously
      (through a vein) over two hours on the first day of 21-day treatment cycles-that is, once
      every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue as long as the cancer is under control and side
      effects do not require stopping the drug. Urine will be collected over 48 hours after the
      infusion to determine how much of the drug is eliminated in urine. Blood tests will be done
      to monitor safety of the treatment, and imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT and MRI scans,
      will be done periodically to evaluate the tumor's response to treatment.

      Special blood tests will also be done to study how oxaliplatin is eliminated from the body.
      With the first dose of the drug, blood samples will be collected just before the infusion
      begins, just before it ends, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after
      the infusion, and again 1 week and 3 weeks later. Additional blood samples may be collected
      at the third treatment cycle.

      Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane platinum derivative with known anticancer activity in
      solid tumors. The recommended single-agent dose of oxaliplatin in adult cancer patients is
      130 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours every 3 weeks. Hepatic metabolism is the major
      route of drug elimination for many anti-cancer agents. Although there is limited safety and
      pharmacokinetic data for oxaliplatin in patients with renal impairment, there is currently no
      data regarding its disposition in patients with liver dysfunction. This phase I and
      pharmacologic study of a single agent oxaliplatin is being conducted in adult cancer patients
      with advanced malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. Patients will be
      stratified into five groups based upon their degree of liver dysfunction as assessed by liver
      function tests. Group A will consist of patients with normal hepatic function to serve as
      pharmacologic controls. Group E will consist of patients who have received a liver
      transplant. The remaining 3 groups will start at different doses of oxaliplatin based on
      hepatic dysfunction and dose escalation in these groups will proceed in a manner in
      accordance with standard phase I trial with 3 patients per dose level until dose limiting
      toxicity is observed. Pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed in all patients on study.
      The goals of this trial are to define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of single agent
      oxaliplatin in this patient population and to determine recommended doses of oxaliplatin in
      patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment.

        which standard curative or palliative treatments do not exist or are no longer effective.

        Must have had 3 or fewer previous regimens (may have included prior platinum therapy).
        Previous radiation allowed but should have included less than or equal to 30% of bone
        marrow.

        At least 18 years old.

        Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%. Patients should have an expected
        survival of at least 2 months.

        than or equal to 1,500/micro liter; or platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/micro
        liter, creatinine within normal institutional limits; or measured creatinine clearance
        greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
        normal.
