      A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce
      substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the
      vessel. This regulating activity of the endothelium is dysfunctional in several diseases of
      the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol.

      Previous research has pointed toward a decrease in the action of nitric oxide (NO) as the
      cause of this abnormality. Nitric oxide is a substance produced by the cells of the
      endothelium that plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels.

      In this project researchers plan to study blood flow through the blood vessels in patients
      forearms after receiving four different drugs: sodium nitroprusside, acetylcholine, L-NMMA,
      and aspirin. These four drugs act on the blood vessels of the forearm through different
      mechanisms. Acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside are drugs that open the blood vessels of
      the forearm and increase blood flow through the vessel. L-NMMA is a drug that blocks
      production of nitric oxide (NO). Aspirin's role in controlling blood flow is unknown.

      Patients participating in this research study will not directly benefit from it. However, the
      study will contribute to researchers understanding of diseases of the blood vessels and
      heart.

      The endothelium modulates vascular tone by the release of constricting and relaxing
      substances that act on the underlying smooth muscle. This regulatory activity of the
      endothelium is dysfunctional in a number of cardiovascular conditions, including essential
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies from our group have implicated a
      decreased action of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) as the mechanism responsible for
      this abnormality. Whether this reduced bioactivity of NO is related to vasoactive prostanoids
      remains uncertain.

      We propose to test the hypothesis that an increased production of vasoactive prostanoids by
      the cyclooxygenase (COX) system is responsible for the reduced bioactivity of NO in essential
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We will investigate the effect of COX inhibition by
      aspirin (ASA) on resting vascular tone, and on both endothelium-dependent and independent
      vasodilation in normal subjects, hypertensive patients, and hypercholesterolemic patients.

      For this purpose, we propose to analyze the regional vascular responses to acetylcholine
      (ACH) and to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) before and after the administration of ASA. We will
      also analyze the basal forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to increasing doses of ASA
      infusion. We will employ infusion of drugs into the brachial artery and we will measure the
      responses of the forearm vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography.
