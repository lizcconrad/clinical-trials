  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin-1 in treating patients with recurrent
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response to bryostatin 1 (BRYO) administered weekly for 3 weeks in patients
      with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Assess the toxic effects of this treatment. III. Establish the correlation between PKC
      isoenzyme activity and BRYO function in lymphoma cells and normal lymphocytes.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BRYO and its relationship to pharmacodynamics.
