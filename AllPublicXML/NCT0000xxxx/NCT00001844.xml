      This study will evaluate new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) methods using a MRI machine
      more powerful than those in most hospitals. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a large magnet
      and radio waves to produce images of the human body. It can also provide information about
      brain chemistry and physiology. This study will use the new MRI hardware and methods to
      measure blood flow and metabolism in regions of the brain during simple tasks, such as
      listening to tones or watching flashing checkerboards.

      Healthy normal volunteers will undergo MRI scanning. For this procedure, the person lies on a
      stretcher that is moved into a MRI machine, which produces a strong magnetic field. A special
      lightweight coil is placed on the person's head to obtain better pictures. The scan time
      ranges from 20 minutes to 2 hours, with the average scan lasting between 45 and 90 minutes.

      During the MRI, the person may be asked to perform simple tasks, such as listening to tones
      or watching a screen, tapping fingers or moving a hand. More complex tasks may require
      thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons.

      The images produced in this study will be compared with those produced using standard MRI.
      The results will be used to develop improved imaging methods for better patient care and
      research.

      Technical advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
      (MRS) has provided researchers with the opportunity to study functional and metabolic changes
      of the central nervous system (CNS) in both healthy controls and individuals with
      neurological diseases in response to sensory, motor or cognitive stimulation. While MRI is in
      common usage in radiology departments and clinics MRI and MRS techniques and hardware are
      continually being upgraded and designed for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the CNS at 3.0 Tesla. We will evaluate new
      sequences on volunteers and for potential use in patients with CNS pathology. These studies
      are required in order to develop and implement new imaging techniques for research and
      clinical applications.

             preclude their participation for technical development (e.g. claustrophobia)

          4. Subjects will be excluded if they present unnecessary risk (e.g. Brain surgery of
             uncertain type, etc.).
