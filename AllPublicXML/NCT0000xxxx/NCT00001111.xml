      Monotherapy phase: To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and
      preliminary activity of nevirapine administered alone in mildly to moderately symptomatic
      HIV-infected children ages 2 months to less than 18 years; to evaluate and compare the
      safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in HIV-infected children ages 1 day to
      less than 2 months. Combination therapy phase: To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerance,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of nevirapine administered in combination with
      zidovudine (AZT) in mildly to moderately symptomatic HIV-infected children ages 2 months to
      less than 18 years.

      Compounds with reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity that are more potent and less toxic
      than the nucleoside analogues are needed. Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) has shown in vitro
      inhibitory activity against HIV-1reverse transcriptase and has shown a synergistic inhibition
      of HIV-1 replication when combined with zidovudine (AZT) in a plaque reduction assay.

      Compounds with reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity that are more potent and less toxic
      than the nucleoside analogues are needed. Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) has shown in vitro
      inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and has shown a synergistic
      inhibition of HIV-1 replication when combined with zidovudine (AZT) in a plaque reduction
      assay.

      Sixty mildly to moderately symptomatic HIV-infected children (five patients in each of four
      age groups) will receive oral nevirapine at 1 of 3 doses for 168 days. If preliminary
      activity is demonstrated and toxicity is acceptable after 84 days of treatment in the three
      oldest age groups (ages 2 months - less than 2 years, ages 2 years - less than 13 years, and
      ages 13 years - less than 18 years), children ages 1 day - less than 2 months will receive
      one of the three doses of nevirapine. Additionally, 15 additional patients (five in each of
      three age groups) will receive zidovudine in combination with nevirapine. At the end of 24
      weeks of combination therapy, patients discontinue zidovudine for 2 weeks while remaining on
      nevirapine, in order for pharmacokinetic sampling to be done. Children will be enrolled
      sequentially by decreasing age and increasing nevirapine dose.
