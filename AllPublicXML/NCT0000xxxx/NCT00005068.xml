      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of two different regimens of
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable solid
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin calcium (Saltz regimen vs Mayo regimen) plus oxaliplatin (arm I vs arm II) in
      patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. II. Determine the effect of irinotecan
      on the disposition of oxaliplatin in these patients. III. Assess the development of
      peripheral neuropathy in these patients on the Mayo regimen. IV. Determine the activity of
      these regimens in patients with metastatic solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are entered to one of two treatment arms:
      Arm I (Saltz regimen): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV,
      and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days
      1 and 15. Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Arm II (Mayo regimen): Patients receive irinotecan IV
      over 90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, followed by leucovorin calcium IV
      and fluorouracil IV over 90 minutes on days 2-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil (one of two treatment doses for arm II),
      and one of two treatment doses of irinotecan and oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-14 months.
