      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may allow
      the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus bone marrow
      transplantation in treating patients with metastatic melanoma that has not responded to
      previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic malignant
      melanoma who have failed first-line therapy when treated with match-related allogeneic bone
      marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive a preparative regimen of busulfan and
      cyclophosphamide. Busulfan PO is administered every 6 hours on days -7 to -4.
      Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on days -3 to -2 followed by one day of rest. Bone marrow
      infusion occurs on day 0. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180.
      Methotrexate IV is administered on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor is administered as a continuous IV every 2 hours starting on day 12 and continuing
      until absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1,000 g/dL for 2 consecutive days. Patients
      receive weekly follow up for the first 180 days and monthly thereafter. Patients are followed
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6 patients with melanoma will be accrued.
