      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and effectiveness of budesonide in patients with primary
      sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cirrhosis experiencing a suboptimal response to
      ursodeoxycholic acid.

      II. Estimate the efficacy of this therapy in these patient groups as a means of evaluating
      the feasibility of a long-term randomized trial.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive budesonide by mouth 3 times daily for a minimum of 6 months. If liver
      biochemistries become normal, dosage is reduced to once daily. Treatment discontinues after 1
      year.
