      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan and
           capecitabine when given in combination with a fixed dose of oxaliplatin in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor response of these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan and capecitabine.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by irinotecan IV over 30
      minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days
      1-5 weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and capecitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15
      months.
