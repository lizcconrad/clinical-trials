      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan and thiotepa plus bone marrow
      or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory
      solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of melphalan and thiopeta in patients
      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the overall survival and response
      rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 4 or 24 hours on day 2, followed by daily filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing through day 7 or until WBCs are greater than
      100,000 cells/mm3. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow is collected
      on days 5-7. At 30-50 days following mobilization, patients receive melphalan IV over 15-60
      minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2, followed by
      autologous bone marrow transplantation or PBSC infusion on day 0. Sequential dose escalation
      of melphalan is followed by sequential dose escalation of thiotepa. Dose escalation in
      cohorts of 5 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4, 3 of 7, 4 of 11, or 5 of 15
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 60 days and at 12
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
