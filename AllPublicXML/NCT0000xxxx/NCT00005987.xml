      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to
      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Colony-stimulating
      factors such as filgrastim and sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side
      effects of chemotherapy. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is
      not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of filgrastim with that of
      sargramostim plus chemotherapy, peripheral stem cell transplantation, and interferon alfa in
      treating patients who have multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare disease control and extended survival in patients with multiple myeloma when
           treated with either filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) plus high-dose
           chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation
           followed by interferon alfa.

        -  Determine whether these priming treatments induce sufficient mobilization of circulating
           PBSC to allow their collection by leukapheresis for subsequent use in autologous
           transplantation in these patients.

        -  Determine whether these treatments induce complete response in conjunction with rapid
           hematopoietic recovery and modest transplant-associated morbidity and mortality in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine whether interferon alfa, given as maintenance immunostimulatory therapy for
           patients achieving significant cytoreduction post transplantation, can prevent or delay
           malignant relapse in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: In the priming phase, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 1,
           mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-2, and dexamethasone IV every 12 hours
           beginning on day 1 for a total of 4 doses. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           IV over 2 hours or subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 48 hours after the last dose of
           mitoxantrone and continuing until completion of leukapheresis. Peripheral blood stem
           cells (PBSC) are collected daily on days 11-13 after neutrophil recovery.

        -  Arm II: In the priming phase, patients receive the same treatment as in arm I except
           these patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 15 minutes or SC in place of GM-CSF.

      In the transplant phase, patients who have not received prior radiotherapy receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily on days -6 and -5 and total body irradiation twice
      daily on days -3 through -1. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients also receive
      GM-CSF IV over 2 hours daily and G-CSF IV over 15 minutes daily beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until day 28 or until blood counts recover.

      Patients who have received prior radiotherapy receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily
      on days -6 through -3, carmustine IV over 1 hour on day -6, and etoposide IV over 4 hours
      every 12 hours for a total of 6 doses on days -6 through -4. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0. Patients also receive GM-CSF IV over 2 hours daily and G-CSF IV over 15 minutes daily
      beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 28 or until blood counts recover.

      All patients then receive interferon alfa SC 3 times weekly starting on day 28 and continuing
      until relapse or disease progression.

      Patients may also undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks for residual bony lesions
      measuring greater than 2 cm.

      Patients are followed at days 28 and 100, and at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
