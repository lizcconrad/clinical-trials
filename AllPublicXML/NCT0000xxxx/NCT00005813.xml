      RATIONALE: Bispecific antibodies plus white blood cells may be able to locate tumor cells and
      either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bispecific antibodies with
      white blood cells in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes
           in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the response, time to tumor progression, and overall survival of these
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo maximal surgical debulking of the tumor at the time of reservoir placement.
      Within 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive one treatment of intratumoral bispecific
      antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes. Stable or responding patients may receive a second
      treatment 1 month later.

      Cohorts of 1 or 3 patients receive escalating doses of bispecific antibody MDX447 and
      activated monocytes until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study.
