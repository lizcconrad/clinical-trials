  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients with
      refractory ovarian or abdominal cancers. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping
      blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a persons's white blood cells to kill cancer
      cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose of recombinant human interleukin-12 (rhIL-12)
      administered by intraperitoneal infusion in patients with chemotherapy refractory advanced
      ovarian cancer and other diffuse abdominal carcinomatosis.

      II. Determine the immunopharmacologic profile of rhIL-12 in this patient population.

      III. Evaluate the biologic response in selected patients to rhIL-12 administered through
      intraperitoneal infusions.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of intraperitoneal recombinant human
      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) administered weekly for 9 weeks. If a patient tolerates rhIL-12 and
      shows evidence of objective response or stable disease, patient may receive up to 9
      additional weeks of treatment. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression. Dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      All patients are followed for survival.
