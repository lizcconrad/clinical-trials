      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of genistein in treating
      patients who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of genistein in patients with stage
      II, III, or IV prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral genistein twice daily.
      Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 3 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
