    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis is a disease which affect the kidneys. Occasionally these diseases can
      progress to a loss of kidney function in some patients. Glomerulosclerosis or focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one form of glomerulonephritis.

      The cause of FSGS is unknown and often occurs on its own (idiopathic), or it can be
      associated with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). FSGS occurs more commonly among black
      patients than Caucasian or Hispanic patients. Researchers believe that environmental factors
      may interact with genetic mutations to cause FSGS, at least in some patients.

      This study will attempt to identify genetic factors associated with the development of FSGS.
      The study population will be made up of 600 total subjects divided into 3 groups. Group one
      will be 200 African-Americans with FSGS. Group two will be 200 African-Americans with HIV but
      without FSGS. Group three will be 200 non-African-Americans with FSGS.

      Study participation requires that researchers obtain 20 ml (2 tubes of blood). The genetic
      material (DNA) will be prepared from the white blood cells and analyzed. The results of each
      group will be compared with the results from the other groups to determine if one or more
      genes predisposes to FSGS. In the long run, studies that demonstrate a genetic basis for FSGS
      may help us identify patients earlier and may lead to improved therapies....

      Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and a related condition, collapsing glomerulopathy,
      are chronic renal diseases affecting the glomerular podocytes. Currently, over thirteen
      genetic mutations are associated with FSGS. We are interested in expanding our understanding
      of these and other genes that may cause FSGS and collapsing glomerulopathy. We will study
      individuals with affected family members. We will also study sporadic cases; the rationale
      for studying this population is that FSGS and collapsing glomerulopathy are significantly
      more common among individuals of African descent. The latter observation suggests that
      particular FSGS-susceptibility alleles may be more common among African Americans. In the
      present study, we are addressing the hypothesis that genetic variation contributes to the
      pathogenesis of idiopathic FSGS and collapsing glomerulopathy, both idiopathic and HIV
      associated variants.

      We are studying the following groups:

        1. African-Americans with idiopathic or HIV-associated collapsing glomerulopathy. We will
           exclude post-adaptive FSGS, associated with glomerular hyperfiltration, and medication
           associated FSGS.

        2. Other patients with idiopathic FSGS&lt;TAB&gt;

        3. African Americans with HIV and without kidney disease (hyper-normal controls)

        4. African descent controls (controls).&lt;TAB&gt;

        5. Healthy European and Asian descent controls (controls).&lt;TAB&gt;

        6. Relatives of patients with familial FSGS

        7. Kidney donors

        8. Tamils

      We are taking three methodologic approaches. First, we are examining known FSGS risk genes or
      candidate genes, looking for disease-causing mutations and for disease-susceptibility
      haplotypes. Second, we have undertaken a genome scan, in the African descent population. We
      may also undertake a whole genome scan in European and Asian descent. Evidence of linkage
      disequilibrium among these markers will be sought between patients with and without FSGS.
      Third, when we identify families with multiple affected individuals and which lack known
      genetic mutations affecting FSGS genes, we will pursue positional cloning.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, BY GROUP:

               1. African-descent with FSGS: renal biopsy showing FSGS or collapsing
                  glomerulopathy, including HIV-associated collapsing glomerulopathy
                  (HIV-associated nephropathy). We will include adult and pediatric patients. We
                  will exclude patients with hyperfiltration FSGS.

               2. Other patients with FSGS (similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as in group
                  1).

               3. African descent with HIV and without kidney disease (controls). We will include
                  adult patients who have had serologically confirmed HIV-1 infection for at least
                  8 years and lack clinical renal disease, as evidenced by normal creatinine and
                  urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt;0.5 or 24 hour urine protein excretion &lt;500 mg/d.

               4. African descent (controls). We will include adults only. Exclusions will include
                  HIV-1 infection, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease.

               5. European and Asian descent (controls). These samples represent DNA already
                  obtained by Dr. Winkler s group under IRB approved protocols and these patients
                  will not be recruited as part of the present study.&lt;TAB&gt;

               6. Relatives of patients with FSGS. In selected families (in which a patient has
                  been found to have a mutation in an FSGS risk gene whose pathologic role has not
                  been established), we will obtain individual histories of renal disease
                  (hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, nephrolithiasis) and will measure serum
                  creatinine and urine protein excretion. We will include adults with and without
                  renal disease and children with renal disease. We will evaluate children &lt;18
                  years by obtaining a urine sample; if urinalysis and urine protein excretion are
                  normal, we will not request a blood sample unless blood is being obtained for a
                  clinical indication.

               7. Kidney donors. We will include NIH kidney donors only. We will obtain individual
                  histories that provide information as to age, sex, race, surgical and medical
                  histories, and family history. Our purpose is to examine whether particular
                  genetic variants, including those in MYH9, influence the ability of the kidney to
                  undergo hypertrophy following renal donation or the propensity to manifest
                  albuminuria as a sign of glomerular stress. These findings have the potential to
                  extend our understanding of the biology of MYH9 and might have clinical relevance
                  for selecting kidney donors.

               8. Tamil population. We will recruit from a Tamil population. A Tamil will be
                  defined as anyone that identifies themselves, their parents and their
                  grandparents as Tamilian. We will ask these patients about their family history.
                  We will exclude subjects under 18 and multiple subjects within the same family.
                  We will draw blood for genetic testing. Our purpose is to determine whether
                  particular genetic variants, including those in MYH9, are prevalent in a Tamilian
                  population. If prevalence is indicated, we hope to study how these variants
                  influence the progression of kidney disease in this population.

               9. Women who are pregnant will be excluded from participating in the apheresis
                  component of this protocol.
