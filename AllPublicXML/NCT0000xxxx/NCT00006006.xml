    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide plus interferon alfa in treating
      patients who have progressive liver cancer that cannot be surgically removed. Thalidomide may
      stop the growth of liver cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Interferon alfa may
      interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining thalidomide and interferon alfa may
      kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and activity of thalidomide in patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity of thalidomide in these patients. III. Assess the use of interferon
      alfa in patients who develop disease progression while being treated with thalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Patients on a stable dose of thalidomide for at
      least 4 weeks with evidence of progressive disease receive interferon alfa subcutaneously
      twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression after initiation of
      interferon alfa therapy or unacceptable toxicity.
