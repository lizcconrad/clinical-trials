  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to determine the best time to begin a smoking cessation program in
      individuals who undergo intensive treatment for alcohol dependence. The goal of this trial is
      to determine whether a smoking cessation program is more effective if it occurs at the same
      time as or after treatment for alcohol dependence. The study also will attempt to determine
      the effect of smoking cessation programs on the outcome of treatment for alcohol dependence.
