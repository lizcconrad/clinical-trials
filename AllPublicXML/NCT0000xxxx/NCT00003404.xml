      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Radiation therapy
      following surgery may be effective in treating patients with phyllodes tumor of the breast.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works after surgery in
      treating women with phyllodes tumor of the breast.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the local recurrence rate in women with phyllodes tumors of the breast
           previously treated with local excision with negative margins and are now treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Within 12 weeks after prior local excision or breast reexcision, patients undergo
      adjuvant radiotherapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 treatments.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      6-7 years.
