  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define the safety and efficacy of sibling-supplied, HIV antigen-pulsed dendritic cells in
      increasing the immune response in HIV-infected patients.

      Dendritic cells are a type of white blood cell used by the body to fight infection. They are
      instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system. Since
      dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients, infusion of dendritic
      cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system to
      recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

      Dendritic cells are a type of white blood cell used by the body to fight infection. They are
      instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system. Since
      dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients, infusion of dendritic
      cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system to
      recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

      Dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling are obtained and treated with various viral
      proteins (HIV vaccines) or immunomodulators. The treated dendritic cells are infused into the
      HIV-infected patient monthly for 6 months. Siblings must be able to donate on multiple
      occasions, and patients are followed every 2-4 weeks during the study. Patients are screened
      over 3 months prior to study entry.
