      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients with
      advanced cancer of the cervix.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of docetaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. II. Assess the tumor
      response, toxic effect, and survival rate of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3
      weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months posttreatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
