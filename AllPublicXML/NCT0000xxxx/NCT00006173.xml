  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is a potentially curable disease affecting 0.5-5 percent of
      patients with hypertension. The current diagnostic work-up of RVH involves a complex
      algorithm which includes doppler ultrasound, captopril renography and conventional
      angiography. Because of the expense, risk and inconvenience of this workup, patients may not
      be correctly diagnosed.

      Advances in MR technology present the opportunity to develop a single comprehensive test.
      This would combine an MR angiogram that provides anatomic information about the renal
      arteries, and an MR renogram that provides information about the functional impact of a
      stenosis as a cause of hypertension. Our main purpose is to test MR renography with and
      without an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with MR angiography
      against the reference standard of captopril radionuclide renography. Secondary goals of this
      study are to test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidneys affected by RVH is detectable by T2
      weighted (Blood oxygen level dependent or BOLD) MRI. This is considered of value since such a
      test of oxygenation would further shorten and simplify the diagnostic MR test. Information
      gained from this study could lead to important changes in the diagnostic and pathophysiologic
      understanding of RVH.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Healthy volunteers or patients with significant clinical suspicion of renovascular
        hypertension.

        Subjects able to understand the informed consent for this study.

        Subjects must be able to hold their breath for 20 second intervals.

        Patients must be clinically stable and be judged by their physician able to tolerate the MR
        study of 1.5-2 hour duration.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Any contraindication for MR study including: pacemaker or other implanted electronic
        device; cochlear implants; metal in the eye; embedded shrapnel fragments; cerebral aneurysm
        clips; or medical infusion pumps.

        Allergy to gadolinium, iodinated contrast media, ACEIs, or sulphur-containing medication.

        Patients have a hematocrit at or below 30. Severe anemia may predispose to hypotension
        after captopril.

        Patients with hyperkalemia (plasma potassium: above 5.0 mmol/L), because of the risk of
        arrhythmia.

        Clinically unstable patients and those unable to tolerate a 1-2 hour MR study. Examples of
        medical conditions that would lead to exclusion include unstable angina, dyspnea at rest,
        severe pain at rest, or severe back pain.

        Pregnancy.

        Nursing mothers.

        Subjects who are claustrophobic and are unable to tolerate MR imaging.

        Patients with a serum creatinine concentration above 4mg/dl.

        Bilateral renal stents.

        Healthy subjects must not have an abnormality detected on dipstick urinalysis, or a
        systolic BP above 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP above 90 mmHg on screening examination or an
        abnormal BUN or creatinine level in the blood.
