  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to add a new protease
      inhibitor (PI), 141W94, to an anti-HIV regimen that includes 2 nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, pediatric study, 210 patients are randomized to
      receive 2 NRTIs plus either 141W94 or placebo. Enrollment of patients is sequential: patients
      13 to 18 years of age are enrolled first, followed by children &lt; 13 when the appropriate
      pediatric dose has been determined. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules will be
      accrued when a liquid formulation becomes available.
