      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of eflornithine may be an effective way to
      prevent the recurrence of or further development of cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in
      preventing cervical cancer in patients who have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of eflornithine versus placebo in causing regression in
      patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Compare the qualitative and
      quantitative toxicities of these treatment regimens in these patients. III. Establish the
      biochemical tissue markers of DNA content, PCNA, the ras oncogene, EGFR, and keratin and
      involucrin as intermediate biomarker end points for squamous carcinogenesis in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      one of three treatment arms. Arm I-II: Patients receive one of two different doses of oral
      eflornithine daily. Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment continues for 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at
      28 days, and then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
