  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol facilitates the development of methods for determining whether transplant
      recipients have developed immune hyporesponsiveness or tolerance towards their allograft.
      These methods will involve the study of peripheral blood or biopsy tissue obtained at regular
      intervals from patients receiving kidney or combined kidney-pancreas allografts at the Warren
      G. Magnuson Clinical Center. In addition, patients that have previously received a kidney or
      combined kidney-pancreas allograft will be evaluated using assays requiring peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and/or biopsies. Assays developed under this protocol will be used in
      subsequent protocols to assess the effects of immune modulating treatment regimens and may
      eventually be used to direct clinical care or guide the withdrawal of immunosuppressive
      agents. However, patients enrolled in this protocol will not have any change in treatment
      based solely on the assays developed without being enrolled in an additional study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Candidates for a kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplant performed at the National
        Institutes of Health, or non-uremic healthy volunteers who are not on immunosuppressive
        medications.

        Previous recipients of kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplants.

        Recipients of kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplants interested in participation in
        the Recurrent Disease Allograft Registry.

        Willingness and legal ability to give informed consent or permission from a legal guardian.

        Willingness to travel to the Clinical Center for protocol specific samples to be taken, or
        in some cases, the ability to send samples via overnight mail.

        For transplant patients, availability of donor tissue for testing. This could include
        splenic or peripheral blood lymphocytes from a cadaveric donor or a willing living donor
        enrolled on the Clinical Center Living Donor Protocol who consents to periodic phlebotomy
        for peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol monitoring and therapy, including, among
        others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where compliance with protocol
        requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel restrictions, access to
        urgent medical services, or access to anti-rejection drugs after the research protocol is
        completed.

        Any active malignancy. Patients with primary, cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancers
        may be enrolled providing these are appropriately eliminated prior to transplant.

        Significant coagulopathy or requirement for anticoagulation therapy that would
        contraindicate protocol allograft biopsies.

        Platelet count less than 100,000/mm(3).
