      To test the hypothesis that the incidence of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular
      mortality could be accurately predicted by the presence of coronary calcific deposits
      detected by cardiac fluoroscopy.

      BACKGROUND:

      Because of its low cost and non-invasive nature, fluoroscopy was thought to be a potentially
      powerful screening tool for coronary heart disease if its efficiency could be demonstrated.
      The utility of exercise testing for screening had been limited by its relatively low
      sensitivity since it could only detect atherosclerotic plaque large enough to significantly
      impede coronary flow.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Asymptomatic high risk subjects were screened with cardiac fluoroscopy and exercise testing
      at baseline and followed for six years with annual visits. The sensitivity and specificity of
      fluoroscopy in relation to the incidence of coronary heart disease and the incidence of
      cardiovascular mortality was determined and compared at 3.5 and 6 years of follow-up. The
      predictive utility of fluoroscopy and exercise testing, in relation to the incidence of
      coronary events, was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Multivariate analysis was also
      performed on baseline risk factors.
