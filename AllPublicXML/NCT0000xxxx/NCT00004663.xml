      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether pregnancy is an independent risk factor that affects disease
      activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.

      II. Evaluate whether maternal disease activity is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy
      outcome.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study. Intensive data collection begins when a
      patient becomes pregnant.

      Pregnant women are evaluated with interval pregnancy/exposure history and a clinical exam,
      including the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). Assessments are scheduled every 3
      months as follows: visit 1 when the pregnancy is confirmed, visit 2 during the second
      trimester, visit 3 during the third trimester, visit 4 at 3 months postpartum, and visit 5 at
      6 months postpartum. Visits 4 and 5 include an infant exam for growth and morphologic
      parameters; these visits occur on the same schedule if there is a miscarriage or stillbirth.

      Patients not currently pregnant are randomly chosen to be followed as controls. These
      patients undergo a review of current pregnancy status and measures of disease activity,
      including SLAM, every 3 months for 5 visits.
