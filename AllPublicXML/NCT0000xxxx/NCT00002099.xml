  <brief_summary>

      To determine the tolerance and side effects of a combination of lentinan and didanosine (ddI)
      in comparison with ddI alone. To determine whether the combination of lentinan and ddI
      produces a significant immunorestorative effect within the study observation period (6-12
      months) as measured by an increase in one or more of the following: neutrophil count and
      activity, T-cell subsets, and a decrease in p24 antigen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with daily oral ddI for 6 weeks, then are randomized to ddI in
      combination with intravenous lentinan or placebo (administered once weekly) for 26 weeks.
      Patients who are already stabilized on 400 mg/day ddI will proceed directly to randomization.
      Following completion of the combination therapy, patients may be offered 26 additional weeks
      of therapy on an optional basis.
