  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected from patients who have leukemia
      or lymphoma or other medical conditions involving altered lymphohematopoietic stem cell or
      immunological function. These PBMC will be assessed for cellular markers by flow cytometry
      and will be studied for in vitro T helper, effector and suppressor cell functions, to
      determine whether cell mediated immunity is involved in the condition, or indicative of
      therapeutic efficacy or is predictive for outcome. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from
      untreated donors and from cytokine treated donors will be assessed for cellular markers and
      in vitro growth characteristics that might be useful for identifying normal stem cell
      populations.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)
      will be collected from patients who have leukemia or lymphoma or other medical conditions
      involving altered lymphohematopoietic stem cell or immunological function. These PBMC will be
      assessed for cellular markers by flow cytometry and will be studied for in vitro T helper,
      effector and suppressor cell functions, to determine whether cell mediated immunity is
      involved in the condition, or indicative of therapeutic efficacy or is predictive for
      outcome. PBSC will be assessed for cellular markers and in vitro growth characteristics that
      might be useful for identifying normal stem cell populations. Furthermore the capacity of
      stem cells to reconstitute the T lymphocyte lineage will be assessed using ex vivo explant
      cultures established with thymic or secondary lymphoid tissues.
