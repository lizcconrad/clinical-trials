      Group A:

      To compare the time to confirmed virologic failure (2 consecutive plasma HIV-RNA
      concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more) between the treatment arms: abacavir (ABC) or
      placebo in combination with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and indinavir (IDV). To
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/16/99: To
      compare the time to confirmed treatment failure, permanent discontinuation of treatment, or
      death between the treatment arms.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed
      follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only information pertinent to Group A is applicable.]

      Group B:

      To compare the proportion of patients who achieve plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500
      copies/ml, as assessed by the standard Roche Amplicor assay at Week 16, or to compare the
      absolute changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations at Week 16 across the treatment arms: ABC
      or approved nucleoside analogs and nelfinavir (NFV) or placebo in combination with efavirenz
      (EFV) and adefovir dipivoxil. To compare the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms.

      Group C:

      To monitor plasma HIV-1 RNA trajectory over time and determine the time to a confirmed plasma
      HIV-1 RNA concentration above 2,000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive determinations for patients
      treated with ZDV or stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC and IDV.

      Group D:

      To evaluate plasma HIV-1 RNA responses at Weeks 16 and 48. To evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the treatment arms: ABC, EFV, adefovir dipivoxil, and NFV.

      This study explores new treatment options for ACTG 320 enrollees (and, if needed, a limited
      number of non-ACTG 320 volunteers) who have been receiving ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC and IDV and
      are currently exhibiting a range of virologic responses. By dividing the study into the
      corresponding, nonsequential cohorts (Groups A, B, C, D), different approaches to evaluating
      virologic success, i.e., undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and virologic failure, i.e.,
      plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 500 copies/ml or more [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: 200 copies/ml or
      more], are explored while maintaining long-term follow-up of ACTG 320 patients. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only
      information pertinent to Group A is applicable. This study will examine the question of
      whether intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose
      plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations have been below the limits of assay detection on ZDV (or d4T)
      plus 3TC plus IDV.]

      information pertinent to Group A is included. This study will examine the question of whether
      intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose plasma

      Rollover patients from ACTG 320 are given enrollment priority and permitted to enroll in all
      4 study groups; non-ACTG patients are permitted to enroll in Groups A and B if accrual
      objectives are not met with ACTG 320 patients.

      GROUP A:

      Patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500 copies/ml are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms and stratified according to their participation in ACTG 320 (original
      randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The 2 treatment arms are as follows:

      ARM A1: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus ABC. ARM A2: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus
      ABC placebo. Patients who achieve a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of 500 copies/ml or more on 2
      consecutive determinations may continue their assigned arm in a blinded fashion, or seek the
      best alternative therapy selected by the local investigator or primary care physician.

      GROUP B:

      Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA
      plasma concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms and
      stratified by plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (above versus below 15,000 RNA copies/ml) and
      participation in ACTG 320 (original randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The
      treatment arms are as follows:

      ARM B1: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. ARM B2: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir
      dipivoxil plus NFV placebo. ARM B3: 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (or
      1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or didanosine [ddI]) plus EFV plus adefovir
      dipivoxil plus NFV.

      ARM B4: 2 NRTIs (or 1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or ddI) plus EFV plus
      adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV placebo.

      GROUP C:

      NNRTI-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500-2,000 copies/ml at screening
      may elect to be randomized to a treatment arm in Group B or continue with their current ACTG
      320 regimen as follows:

      ARM C: ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV. Patients who elect this treatment are randomized in
      Group B if their plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations are confirmed to be above 2,000 copies.

      GROUP D:

      NNRTI-experienced, ACTG 320 patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500
      copies/ml or more receive open-label treatment as follows:

      ARM D: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/29/98: Enrollment
      to Group B is closed to accrual. Group A patients with HIV-1 RNA of 200 copies/ml or more on
      2 consecutive determinations may continue their assigned treatment or seek best alternative
      antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC. Group B patients with plasma HIV-1
      RNA of 500 copies/ml or more may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available
      antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC, EFV, and adefovir dipivoxil with
      L-carnitine supplementation. Group C patients with HIV-1 RNA levels above 2,000 copies/ml and
      Group D patients with levels above 500 copies/ml may no longer be randomized to a treatment
      arm in Group B. Such patients may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available
      therapy, which may include access to therapy as per Group B patients.] [AS PER AMENDMENT
      06/16/99: Study treatment for Groups B, C, and D has been completed. Group A patients with a
      confirmed plasma HIV-2 endpoint who remain on study may have access to ABC while on study.]
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: With Version 4.0 of the protocol, many of the metabolic
      assessments and the cardiovascular risk assessment will be repeated, and a self-reported
      questionnaire of body shape changes will be added. In addition, an investigation of the
      effect of long-term IDV on pyuria/hematuria is added, as well as a study of HIV-1 RNA in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).]
