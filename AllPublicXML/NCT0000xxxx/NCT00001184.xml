    <textblock>
      This study will investigate in patients with Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis how the
      body s immune system controls inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and
      intestines) specifically, how lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) function in
      inflammatory responses. This protocol does not involve any experimental treatments.

      Patients between the ages of 8 and 75 years of age with Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis
      or symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease may be eligible for this study. Screening tests may
      include the following: medical history and physical examination, routine blood tests,
      examination of stool specimens, X-rays such as barium enema or upper GI series,
      proctosigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroduodenoscopy, and small bowel biopsy.

      Participants will receive medical treatment according to the best generally accepted measures
      for treating Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis. This may include anti-inflammatory drugs,
      immunosuppressive drugs, and antibiotics to treat infections. A surgical consultation may be
      recommended for patients whose disease does not respond to medical treatment. If surgery to
      remove intestinal tissue is recommended, a qualified gastrointestinal surgeon will perform
      the procedure.

      In addition, participants may undergo the following procedures:

        -  Blood drawing No more than 450 milliliters (30 tablespoons, or 15 ounces) of blood will
           be taken from adults over a 6-week period. A maximum of 7 ml (1/2 tablespoon) of blood
           per kilogram (2.2. pounds) of body weight will be obtained from children within the same
           time period, with no more than 3 ml/kg taken at any one time.

        -  Leukapheresis This procedure is done to collect large quantities of white blood cells.
           Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The
           blood is circulated through a machine that separates it into its components, and the
           white cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through
           the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.

        -  Intestinal biopsies Intestinal tissue will be obtained during colonoscopy with
           intestinal biopsy in patients who require this procedure as part of their standard
           medical care. Patients are given a sedative to reduce anxiety, but are conscious during
           the procedure. A flexible tube is inserted into the rectum and large intestine, allowing
           the physician to see the intestinal mucosa. At various places, small pieces of tissue
           are plucked out.

      This natural history protocol provides for the evaluation of patients with idiopathic
      inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, IBD associated with
      immunodeficiency and genetic diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease and
      Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and additional undefined inflammatory conditions of the gut)
      either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The purpose of this protocol is to assess the
      extent and activity of the disease in such patients, conduct immunologic studies of
      lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells derived from peripheral blood and tissues, administer
      and monitor treatments, and study the genetic risk factors for these diseases. This study
      will also be used to provide a mechanism for procurement of intestinal samples obtained at
      sites outside the NIH at the time of medically indicated surgical or endoscopic procedures
      from patients with IBD. In addition, it will allow for the procurement (send-in) of blood for
      both immunological studies as well as DNA preparation as more IBD susceptibility genes are
      discovered and we further our work on association of genetic polymorphisms/mutations with the
      phenotype and immune abnormalities observed in our IBD patients. This protocol will also
      allow for the procurement of blood and tissue samples from healthy volunteers (without IBD)
      here at the NIH to use as a control group in comparison to the immunologic and genetic data
      we obtain from the IBD patients that are enrolled. The immediate aims of these studies are to
      define the immunologic abnormalities present and to identify genetic susceptibility factors
      in patients with these diseases. The long-term goal of this protocol is to identify specific
      targets for development of novel therapeutics for inflammatory bowel diseases.
