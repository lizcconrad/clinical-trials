      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of fluoxetine on social and language deficits, global
      severity and compulsive dimensions of children and adolescents with autism.

      II. Assess the effectiveness of this treatment regimen on neurocognitive deficits in this
      patient population.

      III. Compare the baseline compulsive severity and treatment outcome in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study.
      All patients receive oral placebo daily during week 0.

      Patients are randomized to receive either oral fluoxetine or oral placebo daily on weeks 1-8.
      Patients then crossover to receive treatment on the other arm during weeks 12-20.
