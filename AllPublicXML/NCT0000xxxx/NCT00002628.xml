      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Peripheral
      stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by
      chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells, allowing higher doses of chemotherapy to be used.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel added to a regimen of
      high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and carboplatin followed by peripheral stem cell
      transplantation in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel in combination with
      high-dose carboplatin/cyclophosphamide followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      support in women with stage IV breast cancer. II. Assess the nonhematologic toxic effects
      associated with this combination. III. Assess the response rate, duration of response, and
      survival in chemotherapy-sensitive women with metastatic breast cancer treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients undergo collection of peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization prior to
      high-dose chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients are treated at successively higher dose
      levels of paclitaxel until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. Paclitaxel is given as a
      single 24-hour infusion, followed by fixed doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide for 2 days,
      then carboplatin for 4 days. Three days later, patients receive PBSC and G-CSF for
      hematopoietic reconstitution. Additional patients are entered at the MTD. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and every 4-6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be accrued. The study is expected to take 18 months.
