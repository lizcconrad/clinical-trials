      After initial assessment of their condition by specified clinical and laboratory parameters,
      each of the patients will be treated for 8 weeks at the standard pentoxifylline dose (400 mg
      po TID). Objective and subjective response parameters will be re-assessed at the end of the
      treatment and 8 weeks later for possible decay of response.

      Patients with late fibrovascular sequelae of radiation or of combined radiation and surgery,
      with quantifiable symptomatology or disability, will be eligible for this trial. This
      protocol is designed as an open label one arm study. (A placebo controlled randomized trial
      was approved by the IRB but after extensive negotiation, drug and placebo in slow release
      formulation will not be provided by the manufacturer). Up to fifty patients will be
      recruited. After initial assessment of their condition by specified clinical and laboratory
      parameters, each of the patients will be treated for 8 weeks at the standard pentoxifylline
      dose (400 mg po TID). Objective and subjective response parameters will be re-assessed at the
      end of the treatment and 8 weeks later for possible decay of response.

      In addition to symptomatic objective and subjective response, blood and urine will be
      collected for TNF, TGF-beta, and FGF. Cutaneous blood flow and collagen subtyping will be
      performed on a subset of patients using Laser Doppler, functional MRI techniques and
      subcutaneous tissue biopsies. We will examine for correlation between clinical response and
      these biological responses.

        POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS:

        Regional advanced postradiation fibrosis of the neck, chest wall, pelvis, or extremities
        causing measurable impairment of specific function, i.e.: Decreased range of motion,
        Weakness, Sensory deficit, Pain requiring narcotics, Significantly altered activities of
        daily living.

        None of these conditions present either before or during radiotherapy or attributed to
        surgery or chemotherapy.

        Patients with prostate cancer allowed if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is less than 4.0
        ng/mL and the last 3 PSA values were stable or decreasing. Abnormal bone scan or film
        acceptable if consistent with degenerative disease.

        No recurrent or metastatic cancer.

        No concurrent second cancer.

        PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY: At least 3 months since pentoxifylline.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

        Age: 18 and over.

        Performance status: Karnofsky 70%-100% (unrelated to postradiation fibrosis).

        CARDIOVASCULAR:

        No symptomatic coronary artery disease with frequent anginal episodes necessitating any of
        the following during past 6 months: Coronary artery bypass, Angioplasty, Pacemaker
        placement, Thrombolytic treatment.

        No chronic cardiac failure with persistent hemodynamic abnormality and ejection fraction
        less than 40%.

        No coagulation, platelet, or vascular disorder that threatens to cause bleeding.

        OTHER:

        No intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthines (e.g., caffeine, theophylline,
        theobromine).

        No seizure disorder.

        No peptic ulcer disease.

        Willing to undergo serial evaluations (excluding biopsies, laser Doppler, MRI) by NCI
        rehabilitation specialist for documentation and grading of functional disability.

        No pregnant or nursing women.

        Adequate contraception encouraged in fertile women.
