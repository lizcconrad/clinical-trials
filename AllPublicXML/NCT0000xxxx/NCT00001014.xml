  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug therapy (trimetrexate plus
      leucovorin calcium) with that of conventional therapy (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) in the
      treatment of moderately severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients who have
      AIDS, are HIV positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection. New treatments are needed to
      reduce the mortality rate from PCP in AIDS patients and to reduce the high relapse rate found
      after conventional therapy. Trimetrexate (TMTX) was chosen for this trial because it was
      found to be much more potent than sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) against the PCP
      organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with leucovorin (LCV), did not cause
      severe toxicity in a preliminary trial. It is believed that TMTX will be more effective in
      treating PCP and in preventing a recurrence of PCP.

      New treatments are needed to reduce the mortality rate from PCP in AIDS patients and to
      reduce the high relapse rate found after conventional therapy. Trimetrexate (TMTX) was chosen
      for this trial because it was found to be much more potent than sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
      (SMX/TMP) against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with
      leucovorin (LCV), did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial. It is believed that
      TMTX will be more effective in treating PCP and in preventing a recurrence of PCP.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to trimetrexate / leucovorin (TMTX / LCV)
      or to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) for a 21-day trial. For the first 10 days, the
      trial is double-blind (neither patient nor physician knows which drugs the patient is
      receiving), and drugs are given by intravenous infusion. TMTX is given once every 24 hours
      and LCV every 6 hours; SMX/TMP is given every 6 hours. Doses are determined by body size.
      After the first 10 days, LCV and SMX/TMP may be given orally. Doses are adjusted or treatment
      is changed to intravenous pentamidine if side effects are too severe. During the 21-day
      trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used because of possible increased bone marrow toxicity.
      AZT may be resumed as soon as the patient's white cell count is acceptable. Drug therapy
      aimed at preventing recurrence of PCP is not allowed for a minimum of 4 weeks after the
      completion of study therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Acetaminophen 650 mg prescribed as necessary for temperature &gt; 38.7 degrees C.
             Acetaminophen q4h should not be prescribed as a standing order for more than 48 hours.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine as long as such therapy is suspended prior to randomization and not
             reinstituted until therapy for the acute episode is completed.

          -  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

          -  Unequivocal diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) by morphologic
             confirmation of three or more typical P. carinii organisms in sputum, bronchoalveolar
             lavage fluid, or lung tissue obtained by transbronchial or open-lung biopsy within 3
             days before or after randomization. If morphologic confirmation is not possible prior
             to therapy, patients may be randomized if the investigator believes there is a high
             suspicion of PCP based on clinical presentation. If morphologic diagnosis cannot be
             established within 6 days of randomization, the patient will be withdrawn from study
             therapy.

          -  Resting alveolar-arterial oxygen differences = or &gt; 30 mm Hg on room air.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Inability to have alveolar blood gas analysis on room air.

          -  Medically unable to receive a liter of intravenous fluid (5 percent dextrose in water)
             per 24 hours. This procedure is required in order to maintain blinding.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 14 days of study entry:

          -  Systemic steroids exceeding physiological replacement.

          -  Other investigational drugs.

          -  Excluded within 6 weeks of study entry:

          -  Antiprotozoal regimen for this episode consisting of pentamidine, eflornithine, DFMO,
             or dapsone, for therapy of active Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)

          -  History of Type I hypersensitivity (i.e., urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis),
             exfoliative dermatitis, or other life-threatening reaction secondary to antibiotics
             containing sulfa, trimethoprim, or trimetrexate.

          -  History of life-threatening pentamidine toxicity.

          -  Requirement for treatment with agents that are known to be myelosuppressive or
             nephrotoxic during the period of acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) therapy.

          -  Other drugs for the treatment or prevention of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
