  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering strategies in the United States
      population. The study used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model, a state-transition
      computer simulation model used to obtain forecasts of the public health impact and economic
      cost of CHD in the United States population.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study was part of an Institute-initiated Request for Applications (RFA) titled
      &quot;Cost-Effective Strategies of Cholesterol-Lowering&quot; released by the NHLBI in 1990. The RFA
      was stimulated by the controversy concerning costs and cost-effectiveness that followed the
      1987 report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection,
      Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. The RFA was intended to
      support a broad and thorough quantitative exploration of the potential health benefits and
      costs of cholesterol-lowering from multiple perspectives.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study added to the CHD Policy Model the capability to model the consequences of
      reductions in LDL cholesterol and increases in HDL/LDL ratios in the United States
      population. The CHD Policy Model was used for several studies, including: to compare the
      implications of using alternative epidemiologic studies as the basis for estimating the
      association between cholesterol levels and CHD risk; to derive cutting points for initiating
      cholesterol reduction, specific to age, sex, and CHD risk factors, and based on
      cost-effectiveness criteria; to compare the cost-effectiveness of specific targeted and
      population-wide strategies for cholesterol reduction; to incorporate the effects of
      treatments on quality of life, including both adverse effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs
      and reductions in CHD morbid events; and finally, to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of
      cholesterol screening, incorporating costs of screening, effects of measurement error on
      misclassification of patients, and variations in individual cholesterol levels over time.
