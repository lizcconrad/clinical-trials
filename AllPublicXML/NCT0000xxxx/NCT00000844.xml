  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of three preparations of low-dose oral interferon alpha (i.e.,
      Alferon LDO, Veldona, and Ferimmune) on HIV symptoms in HIV-infected patients. To evaluate
      differences in response to oral interferon alpha according to gender, race/ethnicity, and use
      of antiretrovirals.

      Previous or ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of low-dose oral interferon alpha
      have produced different results, and it is not clear whether the differences were due to the
      interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design. Therefore, three
      preparations will be compared to evaluate their potential efficacies.

      interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design. Therefore, three

      Patients are randomized to receive 6 months of Alferon LDO alone, Alferon with Veldona,
      Alferon with Ferimmune, or three placebos, with follow-up visits monthly.
