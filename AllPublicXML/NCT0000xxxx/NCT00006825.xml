      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy
      with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin and trastuzumab
      in treating women who have advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity, including cardiac toxicity, of doxorubicin HCl liposome and
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with advanced HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1, followed by
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
