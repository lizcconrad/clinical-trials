      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of NTBC in children with tyrosinemia I.

      II. Evaluate the effects of NTBC on survival, rate of neurologic crises, improvement in renal
      tubular damage, reduction in the need for liver transplantation, and reduction in the
      development of hepatocarcinoma in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age at onset of symptoms (0-2 months
      vs 2-6 months vs greater than 6 months).

      Patients receive oral NTBC twice a day. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed once a month for 6 months, then every 3 months thereafter.
