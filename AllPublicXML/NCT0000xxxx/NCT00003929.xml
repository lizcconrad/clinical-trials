      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim allow doctors to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy drugs to kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of lomustine, procarbazine, filgrastim,
      and radiation therapy in treating patients who have primary central nervous system lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with
      AIDS-related or immunocompetent primary central nervous system lymphoma after treatment with
      oral lomustine and procarbazine, filgrastim (G-CSF), and radiotherapy. II. Determine toxicity
      of this combined modality in these patients. III. Determine quality of life of these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by CD4 count (50/mm3 and under vs greater than 50/mm3).
      Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1 and oral procarbazine on days 1-10 and days 22-31.
      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously daily on days 12-21 and days 33-42, until
      absolute neutrophil counts recover. Patients with a complete response after 6 weeks receive
      one additional course of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. Patients with a partial
      response, stable disease, or disease progression after 6 weeks proceed to radiotherapy
      without receiving a second course of chemotherapy. Whole brain radiotherapy is administered
      daily for 28 days beginning 1-3 weeks following chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed
      prior to therapy, at 3 and 6 weeks, and then every 2 months following radiotherapy. Patients
      are followed every 2 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16 patients will be accrued for this study.
