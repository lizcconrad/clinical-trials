  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of zidovudine (AZT) treatment combined with syngeneic or
      HLA identical allogeneic lymphocyte transfer in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2) as a
      treatment for AIDS. Patients with documented HIV viremia will be evaluated. Effects on virus
      replication, immune function, and clinical condition will be monitored with periodic virus
      cultures, estimates of lymphocyte type and numbers, cell surface markers, in vitro lymphocyte
      responses and frequent clinical evaluations.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

        - Lymphoma. Active central nervous system (CNS) infection by bacteria, varicella zoster
        virus, herpes simplex virus, or Cryptococcus neoformans. Any prior CNS infection due to
        Toxoplasma gondii. Any active life-threatening infection including Pneumocystis carinii
        pneumonia (PCP) (if prior PCP then pre-PCP arterial PO2 must be above 80), disseminated
        cryptococcosis (if there was a prior cryptococcosis infection the patient must have had a
        negative blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture taken more than 6 weeks after the last
        antifungal therapy).

        Any prior mycobacterium avium-intracellulare isolation.

        Patients with the following conditions are excluded:

        - Lymphoma. Active central nervous system (CNS) infection by bacteria, varicella zoster
        virus, herpes simplex virus, or Cryptococcus neoformans. Any prior CNS infection due to
        Toxoplasma gondii. Any active life-threatening infection including Pneumocystis carinii
        pneumonia (PCP) (if prior PCP then pre-PCP arterial PO2 must be above 80), disseminated
        cryptococcosis (if there was a prior cryptococcosis infection the patient must have had a
        negative blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture taken more than 6 weeks after the last
        antifungal therapy).

        Any prior mycobacterium avium-intracellulare isolation. Patients accepted for allogenic
        cell transfer must meet the CDC criteria for AIDS. Those patients who meet the criteria
        only because of Kaposi's sarcoma must also have a history of generalized lymphadenopathy
        (CDC category III), neurologic disease (CDC category IV-B), or constitutional disease (CDC
        category IV-A). Patients may be accepted for syngeneic cell transfer even if they have not
        met the CDC AIDS criteria, provided they have had constitutional disease (CDC category
        IV-A) or a specified non-AIDS defining secondary infection (CDC category IV-C2).

        Patients must have a positive blood culture for the AIDS virus before the beginning of
        therapy.

        Patients must be skin test negative for PPD. Patients must have a life expectancy of at
        least 6 months and a Karnofsky status of 60 or above.

        Patients must sign an informed consent agreement. From eligible patients precedence will be
        given to those with identical twin donors, then to Minnesota residents. The first patient
        must have an identical twin donor. Among eligible Minnesota patients without identical twin
        donors, the order of enrollment will be determined by overall good health, the presence of
        Kaposi's sarcoma (which permits monitoring of response by measuring lesions) and/or the
        presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (which permits monitoring of response by
        remission of CMV viremia).
