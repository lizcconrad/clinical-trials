      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus raltitrexed in treating
      patients who have refractory solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in combination with
      raltitrexed in patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Describe and quantify the toxic
      effects of this combination treatment regimen in a minimally pretreated patient population.
      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this combination treatment regimen. IV. Document any
      antitumor activity of this combination treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan and raltitrexed. Patients receive
      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan and raltitrexed
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional
      cohorts receive raltitrexed on day 2 rather than day 1 near the final dose levels of the
      combination drugs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
