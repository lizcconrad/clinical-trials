      This study is designed to increase understanding of the processes that affect the treatment
      outcome of individuals with both alcohol and nicotine dependence. Treatment outcome
      methodology will be combined with a computerized self-monitoring methodology to examine the
      extent to which smoking serves as a cue for alcohol craving and/or as a response to alcohol
      craving in treated alcoholics. Subjects will be veterans participating in the Substance Abuse
      Day Programs at the Newington and West Haven campuses of the VA Connecticut Healthcare
      System. Nonveteran women will be recruited from the community and enrolled in the day
      program. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following two conditions: (1)
      intensive smoking cessation therapy (counseling plus nicotine replacement using nicotine
      patches) concurrent with alcohol treatment, or (2) brief smoking cessation advice concurrent
      with alcohol treatment.
