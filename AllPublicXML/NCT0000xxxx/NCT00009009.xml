      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of renal (kidney) transplantation for
      HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease (kidney failure). Although kidney
      transplant is the best treatment for most causes of kidney failure, people infected with HIV
      are not offered this procedure because the immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that suppress
      immune function) required to prevent organ rejection could further impair the patient's
      already weakened immune system. This study will use a regimen of immunosuppressants designed
      to complement treatment for patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

      HIV-infected patients between 18 and 60 years of age with renal failure who have not had any
      opportunistic infections for 5 years may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

      Before the transplant procedure, participants will undergo additional tests and procedures,
      including blood studies, 24-hour urine collection, infectious disease consultation,
      tuberculin skin test, PAP smear for women, chest X-ray, brain and hip MRI studies and
      DEXA-scan to evaluate bone density. In addition, patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain
      white blood cells for study. For this procedure, whole blood is drawn through a needle in an
      arm vein and passed through a cell separator machine. The white cells are collected for
      removal, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle or another
      needle in the other arm.

      When a donor organ becomes available for transplant, the patient will receive three
      anti-rejection drugs-cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone-to prevent organ
      rejection. Immediately after the surgery, HAART drugs will be stopped for 7 days until stable
      levels of the immune suppressants can be achieved. Then, HAART will be re-started and all
      medications will be adjusted to achieve adequate blood levels. Patients must stay in the
      local area 60 days after discharge from the hospital for monitoring. Frequent blood samples
      will be taken to monitor kidney function, viral load and CD4+ T cell counts. Follow-up visits
      will then be scheduled monthly for the first 6 months after transplant, then every other
      month for 1 year. Kidney biopsies will be done at the end of the first month, after 6 months,
      and yearly for 5 years. For the biopsy, a special needle is used to remove a small piece of
      kidney tissue for microscopic examination. The biopsies and blood tests are done to evaluate
      the immune response to the transplanted organ and to study how HAART interacts with the
      immune suppressing drugs.

    <textblock>
      Renal allotransplantation is the treatment of choice for most causes of end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD). However, successful transplantation is dependent on the use of potent
      immunosuppressive drugs to prevent immune mediated rejection of the transplanted organ.
      Patients who have become infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have an
      underlying immune deficit resulting primarily from the virus's affect on CD4+ T lymphocytes.
      Many of these individuals also develop ESRD. However, patients with HIV infection have been
      excluded from allotransplantation. This has been based on the premise that the immune
      suppression required for transplantation would adversely affect their already compromised
      immune system. Recently, the treatment of HIV infection has improved dramatically,
      particularly with the advent of protease inhibitors (PI) and their inclusion in highly active
      anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) protocols. Additionally, some immunosuppressant drugs have
      actually been shown to limit the replication and spread of HIV in vitro. Thus, the treatment
      of HIV associated ESRD with allotransplantation may be feasible.

      This protocol is a pilot trial investigating the potential utility of renal transplantation
      to treat ESRD in patients infected with HIV. Ten patients with controlled HIV infection will
      receive renal allografts under an immunosuppressive regimen designed to complement HAART
      protocols. Immune system monitoring will be performed specifically to evaluate the effect of
      immunosuppressive drugs on the T cell function and viral burden of allograft recipients. The
      allograft will be periodically evaluated to assess the prevalence of disease recurrence or
      rejection. Pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed to define the interactions between
      HAART and immunosuppressive drug regimens. Long-term outcome will be assessed at 1 and 5
      years and compared to contemporaneous outcomes for non-infected patients receiving the
      standard of care. It is hoped that this protocol will suggest ways of providing HIV infected
      patients with renal replacement therapy without jeopardizing their control over their viral
      infection.

        collection of less than 20.

        Patients must be of the ages of 18-60.

        Patients must have the willingness and legal ability to give informed consent, or
        permission from a legal guardian.

        Patients must have the willingness to travel to the Clinical Center for protocol specific
        samples to be taken, or in some cases, the ability to send samples via overnight mail.

        Patients must have a current CD4+ T-cell count of greater than or equal to 300/mm(3) for 9
        months or longer.

        Patients must have a CD4 nadir over course of infection not less than 200/mm(3).

        Patients must have current HIV-1 RNA of less than or equal to 50 RNA copies/ml for 9 months
        or longer. (Intermittent elevations of less than or equal to 500 copies/ml, if not
        persistent on more than two sequential measures and followed by undetectable levels, are
        permitted).

        Patients must be on a stable HAART -regimen for greater than or equal to 3 months prior to
        entry. The HAART regimen must consist of at least 3 drugs and include at least 2 classes of
        drugs. Individuals with sustained viral suppression on a regimen of abacavir plus 2 other
        nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors will be eligible at the discretion of the
        investigators. The use of hydroxyurea will not be permitted.

        Patients must have a willingness to comply with all study medications.

        Patients must have a willingness to disclose HIV status to their living donor prior to
        transplant if a living donor is the source of their kidney.

        leaves limited options for successful suppression of viral replication should the patient's
        current regimen fail.

        Patients must have the ability and willingness to comply with immunosuppression protocol,
        antiretroviral therapy, and/or HIV monitoring and therapy if indicated.

        Patients must not have concomitant conditions that, in the judgement of the investigators,
        would preclude transplantation or immunosuppression.

        Patients must not have a condition that precludes serial follow-up.

        Patients must not have significant coagulopathy or requirement for anticoagulation therapy
