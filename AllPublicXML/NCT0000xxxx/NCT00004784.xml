      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effects of ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), with and without
      methotrexate, on pruritus, incapacitation index, and serum markers of activity and severity
      in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

      II. Compare the effects of these regimens on the development of ascites, encephalopathy,
      varices (or bleeding from pre-existing varices), histologic liver changes, transplantation,
      and survival.

      III. Compare the toxicity and safety of each regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution and Ludwig histologic stage.

      All patients are treated with ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA) for 6 months. If entry
      criteria continue to be met, patients are randomly assigned to UDCA/methotrexate or
      UDCA/placebo.

      Combination therapy continues for at least 5 years.
