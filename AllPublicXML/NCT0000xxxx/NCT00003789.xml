  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of hyperthermic isolated limb
      perfusion of melphalan with or without tumor necrosis factor in treating patients who have
      locally advanced melanoma of the arm or leg. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Heating melphalan to several
      degrees above body temperature and infusing it only to the area around the tumor may kill
      more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining melphalan with tumor necrosis factor
      is more effective than melphalan alone in treating melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with melphalan with or without tumor necrosis
      factor, in terms of response proportion for lesions in the perfusion field, in patients with
      locally advanced extremity melanoma.

      II. Compare the local recurrence-free survival, improvement in regional symptoms related to
      tumor, and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      burden (high vs low), prior reperfusion (melphalan vs other), regional nodal site (yes vs
      no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions of the lower limb by either the
      external iliac vessels or the common femoral vessels. Patients undergo perfusions of the
      upper extremity by the axillary artery and vein using an infraclavicular/axillary incision.
      Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion by slow injection over 5 minutes and allowed to
      remain for a total of 60 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions as in arm I. Tumor necrosis factor
      is administered by slow injection into the arterial line and allowed to remain for a total of
      90 minutes. Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion as in arm I and allowed to remain for
      a total of 60 minutes.

      Patients are followed within 6 weeks, at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and
      then annually thereafter.
