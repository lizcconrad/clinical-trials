  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To assess the effect of bovine anti-Cryptosporidium immunoglobulin (BACI) on the
      volume of diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium parvum in AIDS patients who have protracted
      Cryptosporidium enteritis.

      SECONDARY: To assess changes in stool consistency and frequency, body weight, and safety in
      this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients are randomized to receive either BACI or placebo (bovine colostrum from
      non-immunized cattle) for 1 week. The double-blind portion of the study will be followed by
      an open-label phase in which all 40 patients receive BACI for 1 week.
