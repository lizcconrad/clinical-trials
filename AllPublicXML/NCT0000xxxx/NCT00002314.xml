  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effects of Ro 24-7429 on tumor growth in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's
      sarcoma. To study the safety and tolerance, effects on HIV replication, and immunologic
      effects of Ro 24-7429 in this patient population. To explore relationships between exposure
      to Ro 24-7429 and its metabolites with its antitumor and antiviral activities and drug
      toxicity.

             measurable disease.

          -  No active opportunistic infection. NOTE:

          -  Patients with CD4 count &gt;= 200 cells/mm3 must have no prior opportunistic infection,
             as well as no active opportunistic infection.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 24 weeks.

          -  Stable weight (+/- 2 kg) by 28 days prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Other active malignancies (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ
             cervical cancer).

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, neurologic, dermatologic, or allergic disease as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Experimental antiretrovirals.

          -  Biologic response modifiers or immunomodulating agents (e.g., interferon).

          -  Colony stimulating factors (erythropoietin, GM-CSF, G-CSF).

          -  Ganciclovir.

          -  Foscarnet.

          -  H-2 antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine).

             asthma).

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy (systemic and local).

          -  Drugs known to cause systemic toxicity, if avoidable (e.g., myelosuppressive,
