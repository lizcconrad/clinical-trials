  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers plan to study the fat-rich particles, called lipoproteins, which circulate in the
      blood. This study is designed to improve understanding of normal, as well as abnormal,
      lipoprotein metabolism and the role it plays in the development of hardening of the arteries
      (atherosclerosis).

      Patients participating in this study will receive an intravenous (directly into the vein)
      injection of a small amount of specially prepared amino acids. The amino acids being injected
      are the same amino acids present in a normal diet. The amount of amino acid given will be
      less than the amount eaten in a protein-rich meal. The amino acids will be labeled with
      nonradioactive heavy isotopes which are also present in the environment n low amounts.

      Patients participating in the study will be required to have blood samples taken, and provide
      urine samples throughout the course of the study. In addition, patient will be required to
      follow a specially formulated diet. Patients will be weighed throughout the course of the
      study.

      Apolipoproteins regulate the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in plasma of humans. In
      order to investigate the roles of apolipoproteins in these processes, we plan to quantitate
      the kinetics of the metabolism of apolipoproteins utilizing nonradioactive isotope labeled
      amino-acids.
