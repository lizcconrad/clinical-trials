      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors or lymphoma that have not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. II. Evaluate the pharmacodynamics of this
      drug by measuring 20S proteasome inhibition in these patients. III. Assess changes in P53 or
      P27, and possibly E2F-1 and cyclin E, in patients with lymphoma in response to this drug. IV.
      Evaluate objective tumor response to this drug in these patients. V. Evaluate the
      relationship between toxicity and 20S proteasome inhibition in blood and in accessible tumor
      tissue in these patients. VI. Evaluate response to treatment with this drug in patients with
      measurable or evaluable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive PS-341 IV on days 1
      and 4. Treatment repeats every 14 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive
      additional courses at the discretion of the treating physician. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
