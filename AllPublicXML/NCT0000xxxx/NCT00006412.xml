  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of fenofibrate and
      pravastatin in treating HIV-positive patients who have abnormal levels of fat (lipids) in the
      blood.

      Increased lipids in the blood associated with HIV infection and anti-HIV drugs is a growing
      problem. The drugs used in this study are known to reduce certain lipids, but little is known
      about their safety and effectiveness. This study will see if one of the drugs is safer and
      more effective than the other, or if combining the drugs is the safest and most effective way
      to lower lipids. This study has been changed. On June 26, 2001, this study was reviewed by
      the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB is an independent board monitoring the
      progress of the study. The review showed that neither pravastatin nor fenofibrate alone were
      effective in reaching all the cholesterol and triglyceride goals. There were no safety
      concerns. It is not known if the combination of fenofibrate and pravastatin is effective and
      safe. Therefore, it is important to continue this study.

      Lipid disorders associated with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy are of growing
      concern. There is little information available on the safety and efficacy of statins or
      fibrates in the treatment of HIV-associated hyperlipidemias. Fenofibrate and pravastatin both
      are able to reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (TG), but it is unclear
      whether one therapy will be more effective than the other, or if combination therapy will be
      needed to achieve desirable reductions in both LDL and TG. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/13/01: The
      NIAID HIV Therapeutic Trials Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met June 26, 2001 to
      review the interim results. The interim monitoring plan for this study states that accrual
      into either single-agent therapy arm should stop if the response rate failed to meet a
      pre-specified minimum at the time of interim review. The DSMB found that this stopping
      criterion was met for each single-therapy arm. The DSMB recommended that patients currently
      on single-agent therapy be offered the opportunity to initiate dual-agent therapy, regardless
      of time on study. There were no safety concerns.]

      Patients are randomized to either Arm A or Arm B and stratified by gender, TG level, and
      number of cardiovascular risk factors. Patients add daily fenofibrate (Arm A) or pravastatin
      (Arm B) to their antiretroviral therapy for 48 weeks. Evaluations at Week 12 determine LDL,
      TG, and high-density lipid (HDL) levels. Patients who achieve clinical goals for these levels
      stay on the drug for the rest of the study. Patients who do not achieve the goals by Week 12
      receive a combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate for the rest of the study. At regular
      clinic visits, patients have physical exams and are questioned about their medications, diet,
      and exercise. Blood samples are drawn for clinical evaluations, including lipid profiles and
      HIV-1 RNA monitoring. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/13/01: On June 26, 2001, the DSMB reviewed interim
      results and determined that the response rates for both arms met the stopping rule for
      futility. As a result, all patients who were currently on single-agent therapy were offered
      the opportunity to initiate dual-agent therapy regardless of time on study. No additional
      accrual was sought; however, exceptions were made for patients who were in screening at the
      time of the DSMB review. These patients were given the option of starting single- or
      dual-agent therapy. The DSMB recommended that all patients on dual-agent therapy be followed
      for 32 weeks to obtain additional safety and efficacy data. Further endpoints will be
      analyzed after Week 12 of single-agent therapy or Week 32 of dual-agent therapy.]

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Are on a lipid-lowering diet based on the patient's statement and have been exercising
             for at least 30 days before being screened for the study. Patients will be asked if
             they were counseled by their health care provider. The lipid-lowering diet and
             exercise program do not have to be prescribed by a physician.

          -  Have a triglyceride (TG) level of at least 200 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
             level of at least 130 mg/dl after fasting for 8 to 12 hours.

          -  Have been treated with anti-HIV drugs for more than 6 months. Patients must be taking
