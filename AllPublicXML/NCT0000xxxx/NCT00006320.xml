      This study will determine if blood levels of anti-HIV drugs in pregnant women change at
      different stages of pregnancy and if these changes require dosage adjustments in order to
      maintain adequate drug levels during pregnancy. Anti-HIV medications are recommended for
      HIV-infected women during pregnancy not only to treat their infection, but also to reduce the
      chance of passing the virus to the baby during pregnancy. Changes in the body that occur
      during pregnancy may affect how the body uses and eliminates these drugs, reducing their
      levels during pregnancy.

      Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who are infected with HIV may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will have a medical history and physical examination, pregnancy test and
      blood tests.

      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center once every 6 to 12 weeks until around their
      34th week (8 months) of pregnancy and then again at least 1 month after the birth of the baby
      to have blood drawn. A catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed in a vein to avoid
      multiple needle sticks for blood sampling during the day. The first sample will be collected
      before the patient takes the morning doses of anti-HIV medicines and additional samples will
      be drawn at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after taking the medication. A urine sample will also be
      collected at each visit.

      Highly active antiretroviral therapy is currently recommended for HIV-1 infected pregnant
      women for the management of maternal HIV infection and for prevention of perinatal HIV
      transmission. Many physiological changes occur during pregnancy may lead to changes in
      pharmacokinetics of drugs. Some of these pharmacokinetic changes may include increases in
      volume of distribution and total body clearance as well as decreases in oral absorption, area
      under the concentration time curve, peak and trough concentrations. All of these changes may
      result in decrease in drug exposure. Other than zidovudine, little is known about the
      pharmacokinetics of other antiretroviral agents during pregnancy. A number of studies have
      suggested a correlation between trough concentration: IC50 ratio and virological responses.
      The objective of the study is to examine the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents during
      different stages of pregnancy in comparison with the non-pregnant state (post-partum and
      historical control). HIV infected pregnant women in general good health who are on at least
      three antiretroviral drug combination will be enrolled in the study. Pharmacokinetic profiles
      of the antiretroviral agents taken by the subjects will be obtained two to four times during
      pregnancy and again at around one month post-partum. These data will be used to assess the
      need for dosage adjustment or therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral agents during
      pregnancy.
