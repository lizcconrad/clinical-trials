  <brief_summary>

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy followed by porfiromycin is more effective
      than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of
      radiation therapy followed by porfiromycin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV
      head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the time to tumor progression in patients with stage III or IV
      (without distant metastases) head and neck cancer treated with porfiromycin as adjuvant
      therapy to radiotherapy. II. Determine percentage of patients with locoregional tumor
      recurrence up to 2 years posttreatment. III. Determine response rate, disease free survival
      time, and overall survival time in these patients. IV. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of
      porfiromycin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to primary tumor site (oral vs pharynx vs larynx) and disease stage
      (both T and N stage: T1-2 vs T3-4 and N0 vs N1-2 vs N3). All patients are randomized to
      receive either porfiromycin (arm I) or placebo (arm II) as adjuvant therapy to radiation
      therapy. Both arms follow the same treatment schedule. Daily radiation therapy commences on
      day 1. Patients receive porfiromycin or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes on
      day 5 and then on day 46 or 47. Porfiromycin or placebo is administered 30 minutes to 2 hours
      following radiation therapy. All patients with N3 neck disease (metastases in a lymph node
      more than 6 cm in greatest dimension) undergo a planned neck dissection following external
      beam radiation at 4 to 12 weeks following therapy. This surgery is not needed for patients
      with N3 neck disease who do not have residual disease following radiotherapy. Patients are
      followed at 4 weeks, then every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550-600 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
