  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as fludarabine use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      damage tumor cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells
      that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells
      can reject the body's normal tissues. Donor lymphocytes that have been treated in the
      laboratory may prevent this.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, total-body irradiation,
      peripheral stem cell transplantation, and lymphocyte infusion in treating patients who have
      stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with
           nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with fludarabine
           and total body irradiation, followed by cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, followed
           by donor lymphocyte infusion.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2
      and total body irradiation on day 0. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on
      day 0.

      Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice a day on days -3 to 35 and tapered until day 56 and
      oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times a day on days 0-40.

      Patients with mixed chimerism and no graft-versus-host disease on day 56 receive donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 30 minutes on day 65 unless there is evidence of increasing
      donor chimerism. DLI may be repeated every 65 days for up to 4 doses.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, monthly for 6 months, every 6 months through year
      2, and then annually through year 5.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
