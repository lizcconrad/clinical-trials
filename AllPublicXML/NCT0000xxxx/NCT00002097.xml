  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical toxicity, safety, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous
      nystatin in patients with HIV infection. To evaluate the potential anti-HIV activity and
      clinical pharmacology of intravenous nystatin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts of three patients each are treated at escalating doses of intravenous nystatin,
      administered every other day, until the MTD is reached. Each cohort is observed for toxicity
      for at least 2 weeks before escalation in subsequent patient cohorts is initiated.
