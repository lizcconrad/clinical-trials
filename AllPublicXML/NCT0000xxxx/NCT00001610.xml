  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the normal range of the human electro-oculogram (EOG) in people of
      various age groups. EOGs are recordings of electrical signals generated by the retina (the
      light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye) when going from a dark to a bright
      environment. They provide valuable information about the function of the eye in health and
      disease. A knowledge of what results are to be expected in tests of normal, healthy eyes will
      be valuable in assessing EOG results in patients with known or suspected retinal diseases.

      Normal volunteers from ages 6 to 65 who have healthy eyes and normal eyesight will
      participate in this study. Candidates will undergo tests to check vision and the health of
      the eye. Study participants will then have an electro-oculogram. In this test, eye drops are
      placed in the eye to enlarge the pupils. Two electrodes (small disks that picks up electrical
      signals) are attached to the left and right of each eye and one to the forehead. (These are
      similar to electrodes placed on the body during an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures
      electrical signals from the heart.) During the EOG recording, the volunteer looks at the
      inside of a hollow sphere, following with their eyes small red lights that turn on and off.
      The background light is also turned on or off during the test. Some volunteers may be asked
      to repeat the EOG at another time.

      Study participants may also be asked to provide a blood sample for tests to study how the
      immune cells in the blood respond to proteins found in the retina. The response from normal
      volunteers will be compared with that of patients with eye diseases like retinitis
      pigmentosa.

      Electro-oculograms (EOGs) will be recorded in volunteers of different age groups with normal
      visual function. The fast and slow oscillations of the EOG will be studied. For the analysis
      of fast EOG oscillations, peak-to-peak amplitude (micro V), peak-to-trough ratio, and phase
      (degrees) will be measured. The analysis of slow EOG oscillations will include measurements
      of the ratio of light peak to dark trough (Arden ratio), implicit time (latency) of the light
      peak (ms), and amplitude of the dark trough (micro V).
