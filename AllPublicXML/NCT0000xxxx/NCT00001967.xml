  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing
      plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It
      is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in
      individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing HAART, even after prolonged periods
      of virus suppression, leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is
      also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and
      side effects. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the
      goals of: 1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, and
      2) minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style.
      Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of intermittent versus
      continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible means to achieve these goals. The
      primary protocol, Cohort 1, will be a randomized controlled study of 35 individuals receiving
      continuous HAART and 35 individuals receiving intermittent HAART with intervals of one month
      off therapy followed by two months on therapy. A second cohort of 10 individuals will serve
      as a pilot of 2 arms of 5 patients each to evaluate the potential of shorter on-off cycles to
      maintain suppression of plasma virus and boost HIV-specific immune responses. An extension of
      Cohort 2 will add 5 patients to the 7 days on/7 days off HAART arm with modified exclusion
      criteria and procedure schedule. We will analyze CD4+ T-cell counts, viral load, incidence of
      toxicity and side effects, HIV-specific immune responses and viral resistance to therapy and
      characterize the virus during rebound plasma viremia.

      modified exclusion criteria and procedure schedule. Cohort 3 will be a pilot study of 5
      individuals who will received 4 days off HAART followed by 3 days on HAART. Cohort 4 will be
      a pilot study of 8 individuals who will receive a once-daily HAART regimen administered as
      short cycle intermittent therapy of 7 days off drugs followed by 7 days on drugs. Cohort 5
      will be a pilot study of 5 individuals who will receive 3 days off HAART followed by 4 days
      on HAART. We will analyze CD4+ T-cell counts, viral load, incidence of toxicity and side
      effects, HIV-specific immune responses and viral resistance to therapy and characterize the
      virus during rebound plasma viremia.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Documentation of HIV-1 infection by licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by a second
        method (e.g. Western Blot).

        Absolute CD4+ T-cell count of greater than or equal to 300/mm(3) within 30 days before
        randomization (For patients who are status post-splenectomy, also CD4+ T-cell greater than
        20%). For patients in cohort 2, the lowest documented CD4+ T-cell count must be greater
        than or equal to 200 cells/mm(3).

        Receiving HAART (at least 2 NRTIs and an NNRTI or a PI) with at least 1 viral load test
        below the limit of detection (at least less than 500 copies/ml) greater than or equal to 3
        months for cohort 1 and 4 and greater than or equal to 6 months for cohorts 2, 3 and 5
