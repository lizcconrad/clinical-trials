      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in
      treating patients who have advanced primary or metastatic solid tumors that have not
      responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
      in patients with refractory malignancies. II. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of SAHA in
      these patients. III. Assess the biologic effects of SAHA on normal tissues and on tumor cells
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
      (SAHA) IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Accelerated Phase: One patient per
      dose level receives escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which a patient experiences
      grade 2 or greater toxicity (other than hemoglobin anemia) with the first course or when 2
      different patients experience a grade 2 toxicity (other than hemoglobin anemia) during any
      course of treatment. Standard Phase: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA
      until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
