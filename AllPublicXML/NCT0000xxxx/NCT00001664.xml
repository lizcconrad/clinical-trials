      The purpose of this study is to assist training doctors about different diseases of the
      nervous system affecting sleep.

      Patients selected to participate in this study will have any of a variety of sleep disorders.
      They will undergo several tests including an overnight recording of brain activity, eye
      movement, leg movement, breathing, heart rate, and other measures.

      Results of these tests will be used to better understand diseases causing sleep disorders and
      may be used to develop better treatments for them.

      The objective of this protocol is to provide training in a broad range of neurological sleep
      disorders to clinical associates who are eligible for sitting in the Board examination of the
      Added Qualification of Clinical Neurophysiology administered by the American Board of
      Psychiatry and Neurology. This protocol is to supplement small accrual of research patients
      who are referred from within the NIH.
