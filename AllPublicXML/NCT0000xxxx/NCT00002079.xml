      To assess the dose-related antiviral effects of SC-48334 and zidovudine (AZT) administered in
      combination or individually in HIV-1 positive patients with 200 - 500 CD4+ cells/mm3. To
      determine the safety of escalating doses of SC-48334 when administered in combination with
      any of three doses of AZT to symptomatic HIV-1 positive patients with 200 - 500 CD4+
      cells/mm3, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs, given separately and in
      combination.

             for systemic treatment).

          -  Significant organ dysfunction.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SC-48334 or AZT or related compounds.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any investigational drug other than SC-48334.

          -  Any anti-HIV drug other than AZT.

          -  History of cataracts or known increased risk of cataract formation.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SC-48334 or AZT or related compounds.

          -  History of lactose intolerance.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Prior SC-48334.

          -  Cancer chemotherapy within 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug or any drug with anti-HIV activity, other than
             AZT, within 30 days prior to study entry.

        Excluded:

        Whole-body irradiation within 6 months prior to study entry. Current use of illicit
