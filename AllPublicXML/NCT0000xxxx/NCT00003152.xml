  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and radiation
      therapy and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      followed by interferon alfa alone or combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have previously untreated stage
      III or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the progression free and overall survival, toxicity, and mortality of
      marrow ablative chemo/radiotherapy in addition to peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      and interferon alfa maintenance therapy versus interferon alfa maintenance therapy alone in
      patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. All patients receive 8 courses of
      cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine
      IV are given on day 1, along with oral prednisone on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 3
      weeks. Patients are randomized to receive one of two treatments 4 weeks after completion of
      CVP chemotherapy if a partial or complete response is achieved and there are less than 15%
      monoclonal B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Patients randomized to arm I receive interferon
      alfa subcutaneously 3 times per week for a maximum of 3 years. Patients randomized to arm II
      receive cyclophosphamide IV followed by subcutaneous filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). Leukapheresis begins after leukocyte, platelet, and CD34+
      levels recover and lasts 3-4 hours on 2-3 consecutive days. If an insufficient number of stem
      cells are collected from the peripheral blood, bone marrow harvesting is performed. After
      stem cell collection, a conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide IV on days -4 and
      -3 and total body irradiation on day -1 is administered. Stem cells are infused on day 0. If
      granulocyte and platelet counts recover within 8 weeks, patients receive interferon alfa
      maintenance therapy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 4 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 469 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
