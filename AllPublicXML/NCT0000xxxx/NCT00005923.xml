  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is an observational study designed to compare estrogen and progesterone
      serum levels with knee and ankle joint laxity, and muscle reaction time as a measure of
      neuromuscular function. Three groups of women athletes with differing estrogen and
      progesterone profiles (normal menstrual cycles, amenorrheic, and exogenous estrogen
      supplementation) and one control group (male collegiate athletes) will be used to compare
      differences in joint laxity and neuromuscular function. Blood levels of estrogen and
      progesterone will be measured at four time points across the menstrual cycle. Joint laxity
      and muscle reaction time will also be measured at each of these points. The investigator
      hypothesizes that knee and ankle joint laxity and muscle reaction time will significantly
      increase with increasing estrogen and progesterone levels.
