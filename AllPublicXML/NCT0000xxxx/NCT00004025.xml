      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells combined with melanoma antigens
      may make the body build an immune response to tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a
      person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with
      interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be
      surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
      autologous dendritic cells transduced with adenoviruses encoding the MART-1 and gp100
      melanoma antigens with or without interleukin-2 in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.
      II. Evaluate the cellular response and efficacy of these regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are sequentially assigned to one of three
      dose levels. Patients receive modified autologous dendritic cells subcutaneously on day 1
      with or without interleukin-2 IV on days 4-19. Treatment continues every 21 days for a total
      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of modified dendritic cells with or without interleukin-2
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each regimen is reached. The MTD is defined as the
      dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
