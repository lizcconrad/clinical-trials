    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow
      obstruction. Fourteen million persons (6.4%) in the United States report having asthma, and
      from 1980 to 1994 the prevalence of self-reported asthma in the United States increased by
      75%. A major factor in the pathogenesis of asthma is the development of an allergic
      inflammatory response to inhaled antigens. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a key role in this
      response by promoting IgE production, upregulating IgE receptors, upregulating adhesion
      receptors such as VCAM-1, promoting Th2 cell development and increasing mucus secretion.
      Soluble recombinantly produced IL-4R (sIL-4R) has been shown to bind and inactivate IL-4,
      both in vitro and in animal models. As part of a multicenter trial, 20 subjects at the NIH
      site will receive 0.9 mg., 1.8 mg. sIL-4R or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks in a double
      blind placebo controlled study. Study drug will be delivered via the AERx aerosol drug
      delivery device. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate efficacy as measured
      by FEV1. Secondary objectives will include changes in FVC, FEF 27-75, peak flow,
      bronchodilator usage, asthma symptoms, quality of life scores, immunologic and inflammatory
      markers, pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity. The study population will consist of
      moderate to severe asthmatics on (Beta)-agonist monotherapy with an FEV1 of 50-80% of
      predicted. After 12 weeks of study drug, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.

        short acting beta-2 agonist only.

        FEV1 50-80% of predicted (must be demonstrated at Day 10 and Day 0). Patients will be
        stratified into 50-70% or 71-80% cohort at Day 10.

        Increase of greater than or equal to 15% over baseline FEV1 approximately 15-20 minutes
        after beta-2 agonist inhalation (2-4 puffs of albuterol via MDI or the nebulized
        equivalent) documented at baseline.

        Positive prick skin test to at least two allergens (defined as wheal 3 mm greater than
