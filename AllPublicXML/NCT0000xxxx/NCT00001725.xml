      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two drugs-dextromethorphan and
      topiramate-in treating orofacial (mouth and face) pain. Dextromethorphan, a commonly used
      cough suppressant, and topiramate, an anti-seizure medicine, block certain receptors on brain
      and spinal nerve cells that may cause the cells to produce electrical discharges and pain.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with oral and facial pain with trigeminal nerve damage and
      who have had pain daily for at least 3 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests and psychiatric
      evaluation. These results will serve as baseline values for participants. Those enrolled in
      the study will take either dextromethorphan or topiramate in a 2-part study as follows:

      Dextromethorphan

      In Part 1, patients will take dextromethorphan and lorazepam (a commonly used anti-anxiety
      drug) separately in two 6-week periods. (Lorazepam is used in this study as an &quot;active
      placebo&quot; for comparison with dextromethorphan. An active placebo is a drug that does not work
      for the problem being studied but whose side effects are like those of the test drug.) They
      will take dextromethorphan for 4 weeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose (the highest
      dose that does not cause troubling side effects) and will stay on that dose for the remaining
      2 weeks. Then they will repeat this process with lorazepam. Patients who respond to either
      drug may continue with Part 2 of the study, which compares these two drugs four more times to
      confirm the response seen in Part 1. In Part 2, the maximum tolerated dose will be determined
      in a 2-week period and that dose will be continued for another 2 weeks. This procedure will
      be repeated eight times. Throughout the study, patients will keep a daily pain diary. They
      will be contacted by telephone 2 to 3 times a week during dose escalation to check for side
      effects. At the end of each of the two 6-week periods in Part 1 and at the end of each 4-week
      period in Part 2 of the study, patients will have a 1-hour clinic visit. Participants who
      live more than a few hours' drive from NIH will have a full telephone follow-up evaluation
      instead of the clinic visits.

      Topiramate

      Patients who receive topiramate will follow a plan similar to that described above for
      dextromethorphan, with the following exceptions. They will take topiramate and an inactive
      placebo (a look-alike pill that has no active ingredients) in two separate 12-week periods.
      Patients' maximum tolerated dose will be determined in the first 8 weeks and they will stay
      on that dose for the remaining 4 weeks of each period. Patients who respond to the medication
      in Part 1 may continue with Part 2 to confirm the response. Part 2 consists of six 6-week
      periods. The first 4 weeks of each will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      the patient will remain on that dose for the next 2 weeks. Patients will keep a daily pain
      diary and will be contacted by phone 2 to 3 times a week while doses are being increased.
      Patients who complete Part 2 of the topiramate study may participate in another phase of the
      study that will last for 2 years. Those who continue for this phase will take topiramate for
      the 2-year period. They will be followed regularly by a study nurse and will come to NIH
      every 6 months for a follow-up visit.

    <textblock>
      Some of the clinical features of trigeminal and other facial neuralgias suggest that these
      painful disorders may be associated with sensitization of central nervous system neurons.
      Laboratory evidence has shown that central sensitization can be produced and maintained by
      excitatory amino acids (e.g. glutamate) acting on neurons at NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor
      sites. Given this information, and the need for more effective treatments of orofacial
      neuropathic pain syndromes, two possible candidates worthy of study are 1) dextromethorphan,
      an NMDA receptor antagonist and 2) topiramate, an anticonvulsant drug with AMPA/kainate
      receptor blocking activity. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of topiramate (TPM) or high-dose dextromethorphan (DM) versus placebo in the treatment
      of pain in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and other orofacial neuropathic pain
      syndromes. We propose two 6 month studies respectively evaluating dextromethorphan (60
      patients; at least 20 with TN, 20 with definite trigeminal nerve pathology and 20 with likely
      trigeminal nerve pathology) and topiramate (40 patients; at least 20 with TN, 20 with
      definite trigeminal nerve pathology). These will be double-blind randomized crossover designs
      comparing high-dose dextromethorphan (DM) versus lorazepam (LOR) (as an active placebo) OR
      topiramate versus inactive placebo. The primary study outcome measure (in both parts) will be
      overall daily pain assessed by Gracely pain intensity descriptors. Other recorded data will
      include adverse drug effects, the frequency, severity and duration of pain paroxysms and a
      questionnaire focusing on daily function (modification of the Brief Pain Inventory).
