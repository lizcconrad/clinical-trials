  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the safety and effectiveness of a flu vaccine in school children.

      School children are usually the first members of a community to come down with the flu, and
      they often give the flu to their younger siblings, parents, and grandparents. It is hoped
      that giving school children a flu vaccine can help prevent the spread of the flu to other
      members of the community.
