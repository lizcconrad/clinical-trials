      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of intermittent high-dose oxaliplatin in combination with a
           simplified bimonthly regimen of leucovorin calcium (LV) and fluorouracil (5-FU) vs
           standard dose oxaliplatin in combination with the standard bimonthly regimen of LV and
           5-FU in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure, tolerance, response rate, and overall survival
           in patients treated with these 2 regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to treatment center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), and number of metastatic sites
      (1 vs more than 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and leucovorin calcium IV
           over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed
           by 5-FU IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1 for courses 1-6 and 19-24. For courses 7-18,
           patients receive leucovorin calcium IV followed by 5-FU IV as above beginning on day 1.

      Courses repeat every 14 days in both arms in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 6, and every 6 courses
      thereafter.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
