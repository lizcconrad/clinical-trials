  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate the safety, antiviral and anti-TNF-alpha activity, and preliminary efficacy of
      thalidomide in reducing weight loss in patients with HIV wasting syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive either thalidomide at 1 of 2 doses or placebo for 8 weeks.
      Patients who respond may continue in double-blinded treatment for an additional 4 weeks;
      nonresponding patients may receive thalidomide for up to 4 weeks. Per amendment, patients may
      receive thalidomide for more than 12 weeks on a compassionate basis.
