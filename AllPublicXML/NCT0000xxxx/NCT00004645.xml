      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effectiveness of plasma exchange in the treatment of acute severe attacks of
      inflammatory demyelinating disease in patients who have failed intravenous steroid therapy.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      disease type; each stratum is randomized separately.

      The first group of patients receives a true plasma exchange using continuous-flow
      centrifugation with serum albumin and crystalloid replacement every 2 days for a total of 7
      exchanges.

      The second group receives a sham plasma exchange with no centrifugation every 2 days for a
      total of 7 exchanges.

      Patients cross to the alternate therapy if there is less than a moderate improvement by day
      14. The treatment decision is based on a blinded neurologic assessment.

      Concurrent corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, and high-dose barbiturates are not
      allowed.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 6 months after the last exchange.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

          -  Idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating syndrome, as follows: biopsy-proven if necessary
             - established diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) using Poser criteria; acute
             disseminated encephalomyelitis; Marburg's variant of MS Balo's concentric sclerosis

          -  Eligible without biopsy: acute transverse myelitis; Devic's syndrome

          -  Acute neurologic deficit markedly affecting consciousness, language, or
             brainstem/spinal cord function, i.e., aphasia, paraplegia, coma, quadriplegia,
             hemiplegia, severe organic brain syndrome

          -  Deficit unresponsive to 5 days of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MePRDL),
             as follows: deficit duration of 21 days to 3 months AND no improvement 14 days after
             beginning MePRDL OR deficit duration of 12 to 20 days AND continued deterioration
             after completion of MePRDL

          -  No chronically progressive demyelinating disease

          -  No optic neuritis

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

          -  No more than 3 months of prior steroid therapy Failure on prior MePRDL required
             Minimum dose 7 mg/kg per day for 5 days

          -  At least 6 weeks since other immunosuppressives, e.g., cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,
             cyclosporine

        --Patient Characteristics--

          -  Renal: Creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Other: No infection, including hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus; no recent
             intravenous drug abuse; no high-risk sexual behavior; no cardiac, cerebrovascular, or
             autonomic dysfunction that would increase risk of hypotension; no other major systemic
             illness that would preclude protocol therapy; no pregnant or nursing women; negative
             serum pregnancy test required of fertile women; effective contraception required
