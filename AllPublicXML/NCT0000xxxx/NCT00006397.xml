  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective it is to give multi-drug treatment
      with indinavir (IDV) plus ritonavir (RTV) plus enteric-coated didanosine (ddI) plus stavudine
      (d4T) and if there are differences in responses between men and women.

      Patients are enrolled in balanced numbers based on gender and stratified by viral load (less
      than or equal to 10,000, 10,000 to 100,000, or more than 100,000 copies/ml). Prior to
      therapy, a peer-based patient education intervention is presented. Patients receive a
      combination of IDV, RTV, enteric-coated ddI, and d4T. Responses to this multi-agent
      antiretroviral drug regimen are explored based on sex differences. A pharmacokinetic
      sub-study, balanced so that half of patients are male and half are female, is performed on
      IDV and RTV for 20 to 25 of the patients. About 20 females are examined for study-drug
      effects on gonadotropic hormone levels.

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Have viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) greater than 500 copies/ml.

          -  Have received anti-HIV treatment previously with an NNRTI plus an NRTI combination or
             only NRTIs for greater than 8 weeks and, if not currently on treatment, have been off
             treatment for 12 weeks or less.

          -  Failed to keep their viral load low during previous anti-HIV treatment.

          -  Are at least 18 years of age.

          -  Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria
