  <brief_summary>

      PRIMARY: To study the safety and tolerance of delavirdine mesylate ( U-90152 ) monotherapy.
      To compare the anti-HIV activity of three blood concentration levels of this agent with
      nucleoside analog monotherapy, either zidovudine ( AZT ) or didanosine ( ddI ), based on the
      reduction of HIV viral burden.

      SECONDARY: To use pharmacokinetic parameters to assess the relationship between daily drug
      exposure and antiviral activity and toxicity of the U-90152, AZT, and ddI monotherapy. To
      assess anti-HIV activity using other disease markers.

      Data suggest that bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) such as delavirdine mesylate are potent
      and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently
      available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.

      Data suggest that bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) such as delavirdine mesylate are potent
      and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently
      available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.

      Patients are randomized to receive U-90152 at one of three doses (treatment arms I through
      III) or either AZT or ddI (treatment arm IV). Patients on arm IV who are AZT-naive receive
      AZT; those who are AZT-experienced receive ddI. Treatment continues for 24 weeks.

      PER 12/22/94 AMENDMENT: All patients receiving U-90152 have the same starting dose, to attain
      one of three target trough levels.
