      RATIONALE: Hypogonadotropism is an abnormal condition caused by decreased production of
      gonadotropins, a group of hormones that stimulate the parts of the reproductive system that
      produce and release eggs from the ovaries or sperm from the testicles. Leuprolide may
      stimulate the production of gonadotropins and be effective in increasing testosterone in men
      and inducing ovulation in women.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of leuprolide in treating adults who have
      hypogonadotropism.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Male patients receive leuprolide subcutaneously every 5 days for up to one
      year and are followed at weeks 4, 6, 8, and 12, then every 2 months.

      Female patients receive leuprolide subcutaneously on days 1, 6, and possibly 11. Patients are
      followed 2 months after the last injection.
