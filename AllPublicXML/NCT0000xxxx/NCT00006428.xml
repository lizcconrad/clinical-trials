  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial tests the effectiveness of the drug amitriptyline vs placebo to relieve chronic
      pain in adults that have had a spinal cord injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double masked placebo-controlled trial will randomize patients (n=100) with a greater
      than 6 month history spinal cord injury and a greater than 3 month history of associated pain
      to a daily dose of amitriptyline or placebo for 6 weeks. Patients will be examined before
      randomization by a study physician or nurse masked to their treatment assignment. They will
      be assessed by telephone interview before, during treatment, at the end of treatment and 4
      months later to assess pain, pain interference with activities, physical and mental health,
      and number of health care visits for pain.
