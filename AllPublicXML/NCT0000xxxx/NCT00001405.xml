      This protocol is designed to study the techniques needed to develop gene therapy or other
      treatments for certain inherited immune system diseases.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age and patients with chronic
      granulomatous disease (CGD), X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (X-SCID), leukocyte
      adhesion deficiency (LAD), interferon gamma receptor deficiency (IGR-deficiency) or other
      inherited diseases affecting precursor blood cells-bone marrow cells that generate blood
      cells-may be eligible for this study. Patients who have had repeated severe infections
      possibly due to an inherited blood cell abnormality may also participate. Candidates will be
      screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood tests.

      Patients with an active infection will be hospitalized during this study. Uninfected
      participants will be seen as outpatients at the NIH Clinical Center. Participants will have
      the following procedures:

        -  G-CSF administration All participants will have daily injections of granulocyte-colony
           stimulating factor (G-CSF). This drug is a genetically engineered hormone that
           stimulates the bone marrow to release white blood cells and white cell precursors into
           the bloodstream. The injections are given under the skin in the arm or leg, using a very
           small needle. Patients will have injections for 6 or 7 days, normal volunteers for 5. A
           small blood sample will be drawn each day of the injections to monitor white cell counts
           and changes in the number of blood cell precursors. (Smaller children and all children
           under 10 years of age may have blood drawn on alternate days or less to reduce the
           number of needle sticks and the amount of blood taken.). Larger blood draws will be
           taken on days 6 and/or 7 for patients and on days 5 and/or 6 for normal volunteers.

        -  Leukapheresis This procedure for collecting larger numbers of circulating blood
           precursor cells is optional and may take the place of the larger blood draw described
           above. Patients 5 years old or older may have leukapheresis. Whole blood is collected
           through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates
           it into its components. The desired cells are then removed and the rest of the blood is
           returned to the body, either through the same needle or through a second one placed in
           the other arm. The cells obtained will be used to purify blood precursors for growing in
           culture and to examine the ability to transfer new genes into these precursor cells. For
           patients whose arm veins are too scarred to for needle placement, a vein in the groin
           area (femoral vein) may be used instead.

        -  Bone marrow aspiration - This procedure for obtaining a bone marrow sample is optional.
           Normal volunteers who agree to the procedure may undergo aspiration up to three times.
           The hip area is anesthetized and a small sample of bone marrow is drawn through a
           special needle inserted in the hipbone. The first aspiration is done on a day before the
           G-CSF injections are started; the second is done soon after the last injection (day 6 or
           7), and the third is done from 7 to 10 days after the last injection.

        -  Repeat blood tests - At day 6 or 7 some of the blood tests done at the beginning of the
           study will be repeated to check blood counts and liver and kidney function.

      Four months or more after the end of the study, participants will be asked to repeat the
      entire procedure to examine the effects of two cycles of G-CSF mobilization in the same
      individual. This second cycle is optional.

      The goal of this study is to obtain CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from peripheral
      blood and/or bone marrow, and Mononuclear Cells (lymphocytes and monocytes), and granulocytes
      (grans) from peripheral blood. These collections maybe used for clinical treatment or
      laboratory research.

      Participants include: 1. Patients with any primary immune deficiency (PID) where collection
      is for clinical use to benefit the patient; 2. Patients with any primary immune deficiency
      (PID) where collection is for laboratory research use only. 3. Healthy sibling or other
      related donor of those patients with PID in need of an allogeneic stem cell transplant direct
      donation for a designated patient; 4. Healthy adult volunteers.

      The majority of subjects will have HSC collected from peripheral blood by apheresis. Daily
      subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor/filgrastim) for 5 to
      6 days is a standard method used to mobilize HSC to the peripheral blood prior to apheresis,
      and will be used for most subjects. Plerixafor (Mozobil) is approved for use in combination
      with GCSF to mobilize HSC and will be used in patients, or sibling/related donors undergoing
      collection of HSC by apheresis.

      Some patients and healthy sibling/related donors will have a clinical scale aspiration
      collection of bone marrow to obtain HSC for clinical use. Some participants may have a small
      sample needle aspiration collection of bone marrow obtained for research purposes.

      Mononuclear cells and/or Granulocytes (gran) will be collected from peripheral blood by
      apheresis following no stimulation, G-CSF alone, or a combined single dose of G-CSF (480mcg)
      and Dexamethasone (8mg) prior to collection as is used in the Department of Transfusion
      Medicine.

      HSC, mononuclear cells, and gran collection from patients with PID may be used for laboratory
      research or may be designated for future clinical treatment of the patient under separate
      treatment protocol. HSC collections from healthy sibling/related donor of those patients with
      PID in need of an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be designated for clinical treatment
      of the related patient. HSC, mononuclear cells, and gran collection from healthy volunteers
      will be designated entirely for laboratory research.

      HSC will be used for the following three clinical purposes, where clinical treatments would
      occur under separate IRB approved protocols: 1. Autologous HSC from patients may be
      genetically modified and infused into the patient for treatment of an infection or the
      underlying disease (Gene therapy); 2. Autologous HSC from patients may serve as back up
      (rescue product) for patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplantation or
      haploidential transplantation; 3. HSC from a sibling/related donor may be used as a directed
      donation for allogeneic transplant of the related patient. Mononuclear Cells (lymphocytes and
      monocytes) and granulocytes will be used for the following clinical purposes, 1. Autologous
      lymphocytes may be genetically modified and infused into the patient for treatment of an
      infection or the underlying disease (Gene therapy); 2. Autologous lymphocytes, monocytes and
      granulocytes (neutrophils) may be transfected with mRNAs to transiently express a therapeutic
      protein for treatment of an infection or the underlying disease (Gene therapy).

      HSC, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes will be used for laboratory research studies
      that include: Delineating the pathophysiology of inherited immune deficiencies; Delineating
      the physiology of and improving engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells; Determining how
      hematopoietic stem cells may be maintained in ex vivo culture without losing pluripotent
      potential; Delineating the molecular mechanisms responsible for lineage specific
      differentiation; Developing efficient methods for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells
      for corrective gene therapy; Developing methods for restoration of function in defective
      peripheral blood monocytes and/or granulocytes; Further characterization of peripheral blood
      monocytes and/or granulocytes from patients with PID.

        EXCLUSIONS:

        Patients

          1. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable (systolic or diastolic blood pressure fall
             of 20 mm Hg from the stable patient s baseline measurement) or requiring mechanical
             respiratory assistance are excluded.

          2. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating as determined by history and/or positive
             pregnancy test are excluded.

          3. Must be negative by routine blood donor eligibility testing criteria including tests
             for syphilis (RPR) and TTV Donor Transplant Panel testing (list is modified

             not apply to leukapheresis patients, as these tests are not required by DTM.

               1. XSCID patients do not make antibodies and false positives may occur because they
                  receive periodic infusions of pooled donations of IVIG. We have observed positive
                  anti-HBc testing in these patients. If this occurs, more specific DNA or antigen
                  testing will be done and must be negative.

               2. Autologous HSC Transplant patients - may be positive for Hepatitis B and C if the
                  investigator deems it necessary to be collected and used as a safety back-up

        Healthy Volunteers and Healthy Donors

          1. Active bacterial, fungal or viral infection as evidenced by history, physical exam
             (temperature &gt;38 degress C), or WBC &gt;9000 are excluded.

             are excluded.

          3. Must be negative by routine blood donor eligibility testing criteria, including tests
             for syphilis (RPR) and TTV Recipient Transplant Panel (list is modified periodically,
             but may include hepatitis B and C, HIV and HTLV, T. cruzi) This does not apply to
             leukaphersis patients, as these tests are not required by DTM policy.

          4. Someone without peripheral venous access in arm veins adequate for apheresis (healthy
             volunteers only).

          5. If in the opinion of the investigator participation in this study places the healthy
