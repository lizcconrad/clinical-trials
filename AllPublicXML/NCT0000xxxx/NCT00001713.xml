  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute deep venous thrombosis (ADVT) of the lower extremity is a common disorder. Traditional
      treatment with anticoagulation therapy is effective in reducing the associated risk of
      pulmonary embolism, but is ineffective in restoring patency of the venous system of the lower
      extremity. While systemic thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be more effective than
      anticoagulation, catheter directed local thrombolytic therapy is the most effective treatment
      in restoring venous patency. Current treatment regimens are based on use of urokinase,
      infused continuously through catheters imbedded into the thrombus. These treatment regimens
      require doses on the order of 10,000,000 units of urokinase, resulting in significant
      bleeding complications and prohibitive costs.

      Experience at NIH with pulse-spray treatment of axillary subclavian venous thrombosis with
      rtPA indicates that this is a highly effective and safe alternative thrombolytic regimen. The
      proposed protocol is designed to evaluate the efficiency, safety, and doses of rtPA
      associated with pulse spray directed rtPA treatment of the more extensive venous thrombosis
      encountered in the lower extremity.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must be 18 years or older. A negative pregnancy test is required for all female
        patients of child-bearing age.

        Only patients with first onset acute DVT will be accepted. Acute DVT-LE must be documented
        by ultrasonography or venogram and will be defined as thrombosis of a major deep vein
        segment above the popliteal vein less than 14 days since onset of symptoms or diagnosis.
        Extension of thrombosis from the popliteal vein into calf veins is acceptable, but isolated
        calf vein thrombosis will not be treated under this protocol, as the benefits of
        thrombolytic therapy do not outweigh the risks.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Current familial or acquired bleeding diathesis not attributable to heparin (prothrombin
        time greater than 15 s, a PTT greater than 36 s, fibrinogen less than 150 mg/dL); platelet
        count less than 50,000/gL unsupportable with platelet transfusions; creatinine greater than
        2 mg/dL; severe hypertension (systolic greater than 200 mm Hg, or diastolic greater than
        100 mm Hg); atrial fibrillation; known right-to-left shunts; pregnancy; breast feeding;
        history of anaphylactic reactions to contrast media; history or evidence of heparin-induced
        thrombocytopenia. Patients with underlying coagulopathy must be evaluated and cleared by
        Dr. Horne or a consulting NIH hematologist before they can be accepted for the treatment
        protocol.

        Any of the following within the previous 2 weeks: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, active
        peptic ulcer disease, hemoptysis, genitourinary tract hemorrhage (except microscopic
        hematuria), major surgery, trauma, or biopsy of a non-compressible site.

        Any of the following within the previous 2 months: cerebrovascular accident or hemorrhage.

        Patients with hematocrits less than 30 percent or hemoglobin's less than 19 g/dl, based on
        Clinical Center testing will not be asked to participate in the Thrombolytic Enzyme Kinetic
        Study.
