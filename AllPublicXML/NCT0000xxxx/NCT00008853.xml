  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and favorable immune response to an
      anti-streptococcal vaccine (a vaccine that treats a common bacterial infection) in healthy
      non-pregnant women.

      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) continues to be the single most frequent cause of
      life-threatening bacterial infection during the first 2 months of life. Further, GBS
      pregnancy-related morbidity afflicts more than 50,000 women annually in the US. Therefore,
      active immunization of women is an appealing strategy for the prevention of GBS disease in
      pregnant women and their infants during the first 3 months of infant life.

      In this study 65 healthy, non-pregnant women will receive a single dose of one of two
      anti-streptococcal vaccinations. Both types of vaccinations are given in upper arm by
      injection into the muscle. To assess the vaccine effectiveness, patients have blood drawn and
      examined at weeks 4, 8 and 26, post-vaccination.
