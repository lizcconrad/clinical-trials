  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
      patients with immunologic deficiency is to determine the effect of isoprinosine in producing
      an immuno-restorative response within the study observation period (including the 2-month
      period following cessation of the 28 days of treatment), measured by one or more of the
      following immunologic parameters:

        -  Increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity.

        -  Increase in total T-cells (OKT-11).

        -  Increases in absolute number and percentages of T-helper cells (OKT-4).
