      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the treatment of lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stem cell harvesting. Patients receive radiation therapy to primary
      site and metastatic sites, if necessary. Patients receive a high dose of paclitaxel by 24
      hour continuous infusion, then stem cells are infused 72 hours later. After a 3-4 week
      recovery period, patients receive ifosfamide and carboplatin by daily continuous infusion on
      days -7, -6, -5, and -4. Etoposide is administered by continuous infusion twice daily on days
      -7, -6, -5, and -4. Stem cells are again infused on day 0. Filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) begins on day 0. Patients may receive radiotherapy
      following recovery from chemotherapy. Patients are followed weekly for the first 6 months,
      then periodically for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients in 3 years.
