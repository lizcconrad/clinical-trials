  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if valacyclovir affects the detection of HIV in genital
      herpes lesions in HIV-infected patients. Valacyclovir is used to treat recurrent genital
      herpes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following evaluation for 2 consecutive episodes of genital herpes in this double-blind,
      crossover study, 30 HIV-1 positive patients are randomized to receive either valacyclovir or
      placebo.

      All patients are treated for 10 days.
