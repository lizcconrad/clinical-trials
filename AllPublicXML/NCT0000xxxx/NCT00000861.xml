  <brief_title>The Addition of Indinavir to Anti-HIV Treatment in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Deferred Indinavir in Addition to Background Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Cell Counts Between 200 and 500/mm3 and Plasma HIV RNA Levels &gt;= 10,000 Copies/ml</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of immediate versus deferred indinavir
      (IDV) in addition to background therapy on disease progression or death in patients with CD4+
      cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA levels &gt;= 10,000 copies/ml.

      This study aims to examine two management strategies, immediate versus deferred IDV therapy,
      for their clinical effects in the context of background antiretroviral (AR) therapy, given
      according to current clinical practice. There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use
      of IDV in patient management, since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the
      United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical
      effects, and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor
      therapy, exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed
      use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group
      of patients.

      This study aims to examine two management strategies, immediate versus deferred IDV therapy,
      for their clinical effects in the context of background antiretroviral (AR) therapy, given
      according to current clinical practice. There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use
      of IDV in patient management, since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the
      United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical
      effects, and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor
      therapy, exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed
      use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group
      of patients.

      Prior to randomization the patient and clinician will determine whether the background
      therapy will be zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) or other background antiretroviral
      therapy (OBAT). Patients will then be randomized to IDV or matching placebo. AS PER AMENDMENT
      06/27/97: The protocol was closed as of 03/25/97, and all patients have been unblinded to
      their assigned treatment. Patients still on study medication are eligible for the protocol
      extension. Patients who were randomized to immediate IDV may continue on therapy for up to an
      additional 4 months. All study therapy, both for those on immediate or delayed therapy, must
      be discontinued on 10/24/97.
