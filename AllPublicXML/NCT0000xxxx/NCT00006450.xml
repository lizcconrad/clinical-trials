  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of treating brain tumors in children
      with a continuous infusion of phenylbutyrate. A breakdown product of this drug,
      phenylacetate, is normally found in low concentrations in the blood. At much higher
      concentrations, phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate are active against cancer in animals.

      Patients between 2 and 21 years old with a brain tumor that has progressed or recurred after
      radiation or chemotherapy, including bone marrow transplant, may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) of the head and, if needed,
      a spinal fluid test and bone marrow test.

      Study participants will have a continuous infusion of phenylbutyrate for two 28-day
      cycles-every day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The medicine will be infused through a thin
      tube (catheter) placed in a large vein in the upper chest, delivered through a portable
      infusion pump. Patients will be hospitalized for at least 3 days when the treatment begins.
      If there are no side effects at that time, the infusions can continue on an outpatient basis.
      The patient or care giver will receive the medicine in 4-day supplies and will be taught how
      to change the bag and tubing daily for drug administration, as well as how to use the
      infusion pump. Patients will be monitored with weekly blood tests to look for side effects
      and measure blood levels of phenylbutyrate. They will have a physical examination at least
      once a week. At the end of the second 28-day cycle, patients will have a CT or MRI scan to
      evaluate the tumor's response to treatment. Patients whose tumor has grown will stop
      treatment and come off the study. Those whose tumor has remained stable or shrunk may
      continue phenylbutyrate as long as the treatment is beneficial and there are no serious side
      effects. CT or MRI scans will be done after every 2 cycles (or sooner if needed) to evaluate
      the treatment.

      Patients with certain tumor types (medulloblastoma, PNET, ependymoma, malignant germ cell
      tumor and pineoblastoma) or who have symptoms that indicate there might be tumor along the
      spinal cord may have a spinal tap. For this procedure, the patient lies on the side and a
      needle is inserted between two vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back, into the
      cerebrospinal fluid space. A sample of fluid is drawn for testing for cancer cells. If the
      tumor has spread through the spinal fluid, a spinal tap will be done every other cycle (every
      2 months) to monitor the effects of therapy.

    <textblock>
      Phenylbutyrate is an aromatic fatty acid that is converted to phenylacetate in vivo by
      mitochondrial Beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate and may induce apoptosis. Phase I trials in
      adults and children have established the feasibility of administering phenylbutyrate on a
      prolonged schedule. A phase II trial of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion will be performed in children with recurrent or progressive brain
      tumors.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Patients must be between 2 and 21 years old.

        Histologic diagnosis: Previously treated brain tumor patients with any histologic diagnosis
        who have recurrent or progressive disease after radiation or chemotherapy, including bone
        marrow transplant. For patients with brainstem tumors the requirement for histologic
        verification may be waived. However, for patients with brainstem tumors treated with
        hyperfractionated radiotherapy a biopsy, a PET scan or NMR spectroscopy is strongly
        recommended prior to study entry to rule out radionecrosis as a possible cause of MRI
        changes. A biopsy, PET scan, or NMR spectroscopy is required for patients treated with
        radiosurgery prior to study entry.

        Phenylbutyrate will be studied within each of the following disease strata as defined by
        the initial tumor histology:

          1. High grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme)

          2. Brainstem glioma

          3. Medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) present in the
             supratentorial or posterior fossa locations.

          4. Other

        Radiologic evaluation: (must be obtained within two weeks prior to starting therapy)
        Patients must have a CT or MRI imaging studies documenting the measurable lesion(s) that
        clearly demonstrates the recurrent or progressive nature of the lesion(s).

        Recovery from prior therapy:

          1. Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study and must be without
             significant systemic illness (e.g. Infection).

          2. Patients must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks (six
             weeks if prior nitrosourea) of entry onto this protocol.

          3. Evaluable lesions must not have had any radiotherapy within 8 weeks, or radiosurgery
             within 4 months of the start of this protocol.

          4. Patients receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose during the 2
             weeks prior to study entry.

        Life Expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

        Performance status: For patients older than or equal to 10 years the Karnofsky performance
        score must be 50 percent or greater. For children younger than 10 years, the Lansky score
        must be 50 percent or greater. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but
        who are up in a wheel chair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating
        the performance score.

        Informed consent: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is younger than 18
        years of age) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their awareness of the
        investigational nature and the risks of this study. When appropriate the patient will be
        included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal assent.

        Hematological parameters: (must be obtained within 1 week prior to starting therapy).
        Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC greater than 1,000/mm(3); platelet
        count greater than 50,000/mm(3); hgb greater than 8.0 mg/dL).

        Patients with histologic evidence of bone marrow involvement by tumor, or a history of
        either bone marrow transplantation or extensive radiotherapy (craniospinal XRT or field
        encompassing a region greater than the hemipelvis) will be eligible and for the study but
        will be evaluated separately for hematologic toxicity. Transfusion support may be used to
        obtain hematologic parameters in such patients.

        Biochemical parameters:

          1. Hepatic Function: Patients must have a bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl and SGPT less
             than 2x normal.

          2. Renal Function: Patients must have an age-adjusted normal serum creatinine (see below)
             or a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min/1.73m(2) or greater.

             ____________________________________________

             Age (Years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dl)

             Greater than 15 1.5

             ____________________________________________

             Electrolytes: Patients must have normal serum electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-, CO2). Note:
             They may be receiving electrolyte supplements to maintain their electrolytes in the
             normal range.

             Central venous access: Patients must be willing to have a central venous access device
             (e.g. Broviac or Hickman or Port-a-Cath). An external central venous access device is
             preferable.

             Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): A DPA must be offered to all patients 18 - 21 years
             of age.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
