      The purpose of this study is to see if the findings of increased lactic acid and abnormal fat
      distribution get better when d4T is replaced with abacavir, abacavir plus lamivudine, or
      Combivir (a pill containing lamivudine plus zidovudine) in HIV-positive patients taking
      anti-HIV therapy including stavudine (d4T).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are allocated as follows: a) zidovudine-naive patients switch Combivir for d4t and
      b) zidovudine-experienced or -intolerant patients switch abacavir for d4t. Providers may
      choose between Combivir or abacavir as a switch for d4t when screening lactate levels are 2.2
      mmol/L or more. Additionally, providers may choose to switch a maximum of 2 drugs, one of
      which must be d4t, in the regimen. Each patient receives 48 weeks of therapy. Visits are made
      at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 48. Tests, including biopsies, are performed to
      measure changes in body fat distribution and changes in lactate levels. Virologic and
      immunologic outcomes, changes in physical signs of lipodystrophy, changes in self-reports of
      health-related quality-of-life survey and the Body Image Questionnaire, changes in lipid
      profile and other markers of metabolism, and safety parameters are evaluated also.
