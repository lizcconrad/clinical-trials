  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and toxicity of combination therapy for AIDS-associated Kaposi's
      sarcoma with zidovudine (AZT) and two kinds of interferon alpha. The two kinds are interferon
      alpha (IFN-A) and interferon alpha-2A (recombinant) (IFN-A2A). To define the pharmacokinetics
      of both AZT and IFN-A or IFN-A2A when given in combination; to define the maximum tolerated
      dose of each drug in combination and to define doses to be used in Phase II trials. AZT has
      been found to inhibit both the in vitro (in test tube) and cell killing effects of HIV, and
      both interferons (IFN-A and IFN-A2A) have shown antiviral and antitumor effect in Kaposi's
      sarcoma. It is reasonable to assume that a synergistic effect and enhanced antitumor response
      may be seen with combination therapy. A study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZT in
      combination with IFN-A or IFN-A2A is warranted.

      AZT has been found to inhibit both the in vitro (in test tube) and cell killing effects of
      HIV, and both interferons (IFN-A and IFN-A2A) have shown antiviral and antitumor effect in
      Kaposi's sarcoma. It is reasonable to assume that a synergistic effect and enhanced antitumor
      response may be seen with combination therapy. A study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      AZT in combination with IFN-A or IFN-A2A is warranted.

      Patients are randomized to receive IFN-A or IFN-A2A (given by intramuscular injection) and
      combined with AZT (taken orally) daily for 8 weeks. Study stops when maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is reached. Two cohorts of 4 patients enter each dose level. Patients do not enter into
      the next dose level until all patients have completed 3 weeks of treatment. AZT will escalate
      only if there is no unacceptable toxicity (grade 2 in = or &gt; 3 patients or &gt; grade 2 in any
      patient), subsequent increases in IFN-A or IFN-A2A will be permitted, but the AZT dose will
      remain fixed. The MTD for a given IFN-A or IFN-A2A dose level is defined as grade 2 toxicity
      (grade 3 for hemoglobin, neutrophil count, or SGOT) in 4 of the 6 patients. Patients have
      blood drawn every week and their general health is evaluated. Pharmacokinetic studies will be
      done on days 1, 21, and 24. Patients tolerating the combination may be continued on the same
      dose level for 1 year except if patient has reached complete remission for = or &gt; 90 days,
      IFN-A or IFN-A2A will decrease to 3 times a week.
