      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicity of cytarabine in patients with refractory systemic lupus
      erythematosus.

      II. Evaluate objective disease parameters, including serum complement levels, anti-DNA
      antibody titers, sedimentation rate, and the systemic lupus activity measure in these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Subcutaneous cytarabine is given for 5 days. Patients are re-treated every 4 weeks for a
      maximum of 3 courses; those who relapse prior to the second course are re-treated every 3
      weeks.
