      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide and filgrastim in
      treating patients with stage IV, relapsed, or refractory low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of high-dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      in patients with stage IV, relapsed, or progressive low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients, including those
      with marrow involvement. III. Determine the rates of complete remission (CR) and partial
      remission and time to failure in previously treated and untreated patients. IV. Determine the
      effectiveness of this regimen in eradicating bcl-2 rearrangements, as determined by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in previously untreated patients. V. Correlate the duration
      of CR to PCR results in responding patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no). Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning
      on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or stable disease. Patients who achieve
      complete remission (CR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional courses. Patients
      who achieve partial remission (PR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional courses,
      and those who achieve CR after completion of course 6 receive 2 additional courses. Patients
      are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the
        following subtypes: Follicular, predominantly small cleaved cell Follicular mixed (small
        cleaved and large cell) Previously treated on Protocol CLB 8691 or previously untreated
        Previously untreated patients with Stage IV disease (Ann Arbor classification) must meet
        the following conditions: Documented bone marrow involvement Lymph node biopsy must not
        show higher grade lymphoma At least 1 additional risk factor as follows: At least 2
        extranodal sites Nodes or nodal group at least 5 cm Male Previously treated patients must
        have progressed or relapsed on Protocol CLB-8691 Recurrence should be documented by biopsy
        if possible Bidimensionally measurable disease by physical exam, radiograph, CT, or MRI
        (sonography and barium studies alone not acceptable) Measurable liver disease defined as:
        Mass greater than 3.5 cm on CT, MRI, or ultrasound OR Histologically documented
        lymphomatous hepatomegaly more than 5 cm below the costal margin The following disease
        manifestations are not considered measurable: Ascites or pleural effusion Bony disease
        (lytic lesions on x-ray should be documented and followed) CNS lesions Bone marrow
        involvement No lymphomatous involvement (including CNS lymphoma) requiring immediate
        radiotherapy A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted
        by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
        terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses
        the former terminology.
