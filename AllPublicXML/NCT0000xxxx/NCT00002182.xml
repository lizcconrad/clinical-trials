        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Failure to thrive as defined by:

          -  crossing 2 percentile lines on standard weight for age curves over time or less than
             5% percentile weight for age and falling from the curve or loss of 10% of baseline
             body weight.

          -  Resistant to oral nutritional supplementation (i.e., FTT despite a minimum 1-month
             trial of high-calorie oral supplements).

          -  Free of significant acute illness (mild upper respiratory tract infections allowed).

          -  Patients with chronic diarrhea allowed provided malabsorption and gastrointestinal
             infection ruled out.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms are excluded:

          -  Gastrointestinal infection or malabsorption.

          -  Significant acute illness.

          -  Any identified, untreated cause for failure to thrive other than underlying HIV
             infection.

          -  Medical contraindications to megestrol acetate.

        Patients with any of the following prior conditions or symptoms are excluded:

        Medical contraindications to megestrol acetate including a history of poorly-controlled
        hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, or heart failure.

        History of prior megestrol acetate therapy in the past six months.
