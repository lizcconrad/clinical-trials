  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is often successful. However, despite aggressive anti-rejection drug
      therapy, some patients will reject their new kidney. This study is designed to test two
      anti-rejection approaches. Two medications in this study are currently used in children, but
      there is no information regarding which drug is safer or more effective.

      Survival rates in renal transplantation are unacceptably low. Therefore, there is a need for
      an improved post-transplant treatment, such as the induction therapy used in this study.

    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is recognized as the treatment of choice for children with chronic
      renal failure. However, patient and graft survival rates in young children are unacceptably
      low. In preliminary studies, OKT3 (a monoclonal antibody) induction therapy received post
      transplant has been more successful than standard immunosuppression alone in improving graft
      survival. This study is designed to assess the impact of induction therapy on graft survival
      in pediatric kidney transplant patients.

      Patients are assigned to OKT3 induction or no induction in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization to oral
      cyclosporine of either Sandimmune or Neoral is also done in a 1:1 ratio. Group 1 receives
      OKT3 intraoperatively followed by Neoral. Group 2 receives OKT3 intraoperatively followed by
      Sandimmune. OKT3 is administered at 2.5 mg (if weight less than 30 kg) or 5 mg (if weight
      above 30 kg) per day for a maximum of 14 days. Group 3 receives IV cyclosporine followed by
      Neoral. Group 4 receives IV cyclosporine followed by Sandimmune. Oral cyclosporine is
      administered in a masked preparation. The dose for Sandimmune and Neoral is the same;
      patients 6 years of age and older begin at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day and patients under 6 years
      of age receive 500 mg/m2/day. Patients will receive concomitant medications including
      steroids (IV and po), Nifedipine, anti-CMV therapy, Bactrim, Azathioprine or Mycophenolate
      Mofetil. Kidney function, incidence of viral infection, graft survival, and incidence of
      malignancy will be measured to assess the role of OKT3 induction and the role of rejection in
      graft failure. Graft function will be evaluated at 1-, 2-, and 4-year intervals.
