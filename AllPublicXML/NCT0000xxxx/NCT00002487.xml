      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Dipyridamole may increase the effectiveness of methotrexate and
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining methotrexate and dipyridamole
      in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer that is recurrent after or refractory to
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical complete and partial response rate, pathological
      complete response rate, disease-free survival, and duration of response produced by
      intraperitoneal dipyridamole/methotrexate (DP/MTX) administered as a 7-day continuous
      infusion in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma that is recurrent following or
      refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. II. Determine the peritoneal and systemic
      toxicity of DP/MTX.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Chemopotentiation. Methotrexate,
      MTX, NSC-740; with Dipyridamole, DP, NSC-515776.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 40 evaluable patients in each category (prior intraperitoneal vs.
      prior intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy) will be studied. If no responses are seen in
      the first 20 patients in either category, accrual to that category will cease. An accrual
      rate of 15 patients/year is anticipated.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven, Stage III/IV ovarian carcinoma that is
        refractory or recurrent within 1 year of complete response to intraperitoneal or
        intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy Debulking surgery must have been considered at the
        completion of prior chemotherapy (failure to debulk does not exclude) Clinical or
        radiographic evidence of advanced, predominantly peritoneal disease on physical exam, CT or
        MRI scan, exploratory laparotomy, or peritoneal cytology or by elevated CA-125 (above 35
        units in Ottawa Civic or General Hospitals) required Disease limited to peritoneal cavity
        not required, but peritoneal disease should constitute the main life-threatening or
        symptom-producing component Good distribution of contrast medium throughout peritoneal
        cavity on CT of abdomen and pelvis required Measurable, evaluable, or unevaluable disease
        of any size acceptable

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Not specified Life
        expectancy: More than 2 months Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,000 Platelets at least 100,000
        Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 3 X ULN SGOT less than 3 x ULN Renal: Creatinine less than 1.7
        mg/dl (150 micromoles/liter) BUN less than 42 mg/dl (15 mmoles/liter) Other: No requirement
        for DP or MTX or any medication known to interact with DP, (i.e., antiplatelet or
        anticoagulant drugs) or MTX (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) No second malignancy other than
        basal cell carcinoma of the skin

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Recovery from toxicities of prior therapy required Biologic
        therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: Prior platinum-based chemotherapy required No
        concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No prior
        abdominopelvic or pelvic radiotherapy No concurrent peritoneal radiotherapy Surgery: See
        Disease Characteristics Other: No concurrent antiplatelet or vasodilatory agents
