  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give MKC-442 plus at least
      two other anti-HIV drugs to patients who have never been treated with nonnucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors but who have been treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors and protease inhibitors. This study also determines how long a drug combination
      including MKC-442 is effective.
