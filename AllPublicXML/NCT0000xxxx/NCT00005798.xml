      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women who have breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine long term remission rates as measured by disease free survival in
      women with breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin followed by
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the safety and efficacy of
      this combination chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected. Patients sequentially receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, thiotepa IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on
      days -6 to -4. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 40 patients with 4-9 positive lymph nodes and at least 50
      patients with 10 positive lymph nodes will be accrued for this study.
