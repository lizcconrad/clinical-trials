      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have primary or metastatic melanoma or brain tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of iodine-131-labeled
      monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2 administered intracystically in patients with
      recurrent or newly diagnosed primary or metastatic malignant melanoma or other brain tumors.
      II. Identify any objective therapeutic responses to this treatment.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive a fixed dose of monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2 via
      an intralesional catheter; cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of isotope
      conjugated to the antibody until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients with
      newly diagnosed disease at entry may receive additional therapy with external-beam
      radiotherapy beginning 4 months after radioimmunotherapy (or sooner if disease progression
      occurs). Patients with recurrent disease at entry are followed without further therapy for at
      least 4 months after radioimmunotherapy; alternative therapy may be offered upon progression.
      All patients are followed at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment, then every 12 weeks for
      1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to six patients will be entered at each dose studied.
