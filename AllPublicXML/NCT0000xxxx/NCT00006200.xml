  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the activity of thalidomide in combination
      with dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with metastatic melanoma. Safety and toxicity of the two
      drugs will also be assessed. Dacarbazine is the standard medical treatment for metastatic
      melanoma. It has been shown to produce tumor shrinkage in approximately 20% of patients with
      advanced melanoma. This shrinkage is usually incomplete and lasts a short time. Thalidomide
      is a drug that inhibits tumor blood vessel growth. It can be given orally. It is hoped that
      this combination can be given to patients with metastatic melanoma without causing too much
      toxicity while increasing the response rate.
