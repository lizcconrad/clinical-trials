      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in terms of tumor response, time to tumor
           progression, and survival in patients with advanced high grade neuroendocrine tumors.

        -  Evaluate the dose limiting and nondose limiting toxicities of this treatment regimen in
           this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-31 patients will be accrued for this study.
