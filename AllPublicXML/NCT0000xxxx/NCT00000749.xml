  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate in healthy volunteers the safety and immune response to 200 mcg gp120 candidate
      vaccine in MF59 emulsion without MTP-PE at 0, 1 and 6 months.

      Preliminary evaluations of two dose levels of gp120 administered to volunteers in protocol
      VEU 007A indicate that a gp120 dose of potentially greater immunogenicity may be of interest.

      Preliminary evaluations of two dose levels of gp120 administered to volunteers in protocol
      VEU 007A indicate that a gp120 dose of potentially greater immunogenicity may be of interest.

      Ten healthy volunteers receive 200 mcg gp120 in MF59 emulsion, and four volunteers receive
      placebo consisting of MF59 emulsion in PBS vehicle. Injections are given at months 0, 1, and
      6. Patients are followed for 12 months following the third injection.
