      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients with
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed,
      progressive, or recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics (newly diagnosed
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma versus recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Patients receive
      oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days. Patients with
      progressive or recurrent disease (at baseline) continue treatment in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with newly diagnosed disease continue
      treatment for a maximum of 4 courses before radiotherapy in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may receive an
      additional 6 courses after completion of radiotherapy. (Radiotherapy is not part of study
      treatment.) Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
