  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the objective tumor response and remission rate of AIDS-related Kaposi's
      sarcomas (KS) following a single dose of tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2) followed by
      photodynamic therapy (PDT). To determine the systemic and local toxicity, and morbidity
      safety profile of SnET2-PDT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive a single dose of SnET2 and are randomized to receive either PDT light
      treatment or no light treatment (control group). Patients are assessed prior to and at 4, 12
      and 24 weeks following treatment, and are followed for 7 months.
