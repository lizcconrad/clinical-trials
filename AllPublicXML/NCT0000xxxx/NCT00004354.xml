      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prevalence of glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) in
      various hypertensive populations and screen at risk members of GRA pedigrees.

      II. Investigate other factors regulating blood pressure in GRA (environmental, genetically
      determined factors).

      III. Investigate renal and hormonal mechanisms regulating potassium homeostasis in GRA.

      IV. Describe clinical phenotype of GRA patients. V. Prospectively screen GRA-affected
      patients with MRI angiography for intracranial aneurysm.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are screened for high blood pressure, suppressed plasma renin activity level, and
      low potassium levels. Urine is collected for a 24 hour period. Blood specimen is collected
      for molecular biologic evaluation for the presence of the chimeric gene diagnostic of GRA.
      Any history of cardiovascular events is recorded.
