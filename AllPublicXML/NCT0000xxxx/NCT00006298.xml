  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to find out how the immune system responds to a specific type
      of HIV infection, known as C HIV-1, in order to develop a vaccine against this type of
      infection. The study involves Southern African populations.

      The HIV-1 virus changes rapidly and many different subtypes have been found. In South Africa,
      limited data have suggested Subtype C HIV-1 is the most common. This study strives to verify
      the most common subtype and also look at genetic differences and immune responses among newly
      infected individuals. Results will aid in the development of vaccines specific for certain
      geographical areas.

      HIV-1 evolves rapidly and multiple genetic subtypes have been isolated from a number of
      geographic locations. There are limited data on the distribution of subtypes in the Southern
      African HIVNET sites. Data suggest subtype C HIV-1 predominates and this study is designed to
      substantiate and extend these observations to understand the biological relationship between
      HIV-1 subtypes, genetic variability, and immune responses. Earlier studies were conducted
      using individuals who had been seropositive for 3 to 9 years with advanced disease status;
      this study will test reactivity during the early stage of infection. This will assist in the
      rational selection of prototypic isolates for inclusion in either a single universal vaccine
      or vaccines tailored for specific subtypes/geographical regions.

      Volunteers are recruited from Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The earliest
      possible cases of seroconversion are included. At enrollment, participants are counseled
      appropriately for their HIV status and demographic information is obtained. Participants are
      followed quarterly up to 12 months. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data are
      collected during physical exams and blood draws at each visit. Blood samples are used to
      assess CD4 counts, plasma viral load, genetic parameters, and individual immune responses.
      Participants who are seronegative or whose status is unknown are tested for HIV at each
      visit, with post-test counseling when participants return to the clinic for test results.

      In addition to enrolling the HIV-infected and uninfected volunteers, each site contributes a
      5-ml blood sample from 50 seronegative individuals for DNA extraction and HLA genotyping.
