      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of two doses of botulinum toxin in the treatment of
      achalasia.

      II. Compare the safety of these two doses in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, dose response study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms; each arm receives a different dose of botulinum
      toxin type A.

      All patients undergo a flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Botulinum toxin is injected
      into the lower esophageal sphincter into each of 4 quadrants. Some patients may receive a
      second treatment, depending on response and/or time of relapse.

      Patients are followed daily for 7 days, then every 1-6 months for 1-2 years after treatment.
