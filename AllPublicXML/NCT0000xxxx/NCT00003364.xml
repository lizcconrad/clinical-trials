      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. The best
      timing for radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy in treating limited stage small
      cell lung cancer is not yet known .

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy given
      at different times along with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with limited
      stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether long term survival is affected by the timing of thoracic
      radiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer who are receiving
      combination chemotherapy. II. Determine whether the development of local recurrence and
      distant metastases are affected by the timing of thoracic radiotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center. All
      patients receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine by IV bolus alternating with
      3 days of daily etoposide IV infusion over 60-120 minutes and cisplatin IV infusion over 30
      minutes. This treatment alternates every 3 weeks for six courses. Patients are randomized to
      have thoracic radiotherapy either with course 2 (arm I) or with course 6 (arm II) of
      chemotherapy. Patients in arm I are given 1 week of rest between radiotherapy and the second
      course of chemotherapy. If there is no disease progression after chemotherapy and
      locoregional irradiation, and a repeat brain scan is negative, patients receive prophylactic
      brain irradiation. Patients are followed monthly for the first year and then every 2 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 398 patients.
