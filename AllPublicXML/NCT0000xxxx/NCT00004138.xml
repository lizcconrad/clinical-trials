      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), may improve the
      ability to detect the extent of non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of PET for detecting lesions in patients
      who have newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective: To ascertain whether FDG-PET scanning can detect lesions that would
      preclude pulmonary resection in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging
      procedures.

      Secondary Objectives: To use the data collected to generate hypotheses to be used in future
      studies, such as which types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET is best able to
      identify.

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) IV followed 45-60 minutes later by positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging. Confirmatory studies, such as biopsy, fine needle
      aspiration, or other imaging studies are then conducted to confirm the PET findings.

      Patients with no mediastinal nodal or distant metastases identified by FDG-PET scan may
      undergo thoracotomy and pulmonary resection within 1 month of evaluation.

      Patients are followed at 5-6 months after surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          2. a) Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, newly diagnosed,
             untreated, single lesion bronchogenic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, non-lobar/non- diffuse
             bronchioloalveolor cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma).
             OR b) Patient is eligible based upon mediastinal node histology diagnosed by
             transbronchial biopsy, and if a separate ipsilateral lung lesion is clearly evident on
             radiographs, biopsy of the lung tumor is not required for this patient. OR c) Patient
             may be eligible without histologic or cytologic proof if;

               -  The patient is strongly suspected to have primary bronchogenic carcinoma (e.g.,
                  heavy smoker with a new peripheral mass with typical appearance of lung cancer on
                  chest radiograph although bronchoscopy and/or fine needle aspiration is
                  nondiagnostic), and

               -  The tumor is clinically resectable, and

               -  An exploratory thoracotomy is planned.

          3. Patient must be medically fit for surgical staging procedures following the thoracic
             surgeon's evaluation of general medical fitness.

          4. Patient must be a candidate for resection of the clinical stage I, II, or IIIa lesion.

          5. Patient must be able to tolerate PET, (i.e., not claustrophobic and able to lie supine
             for 1.5 hrs).

          6. A signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from the patient or the
             patient's legally acceptable representative prior to study participation.

          7. Female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test, 72 hours prior to FDG-PET.

               -  NOTE: This is in order to avoid unnecessary fetal radiation exposure and because
                  the use of furosemide is contraindicated in pregnancy.

          8. Patient must complete the following standard staging procedures 60 days prior to
             registration.

               -  CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen (include adrenals) with contrast

               -  NOTE: Non-contrast CT scan may be used for patients with a peripheral suspicious
                  nodule and no evidence of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy or invasion of central
                  structures. All other lesions require IV contrast.

               -  Bone scan

               -  CT scan of the brain with and without contrast or MRI of brain

          9. A cancer survivor is eligible provided that ALL the following criteria are met and
             documented:

               -  the patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior
                  malignancies, and

               -  there has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years
                  (except for completely resected cervical or non-melanoma skin cancer), and

               -  the patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for
                  recurrence from prior malignancies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has had a prior PET scan for evaluation of their NSCLC.

          2. Patient has evidence of stage IIIB or IV disease confirmed by diagnostic imaging such
             as chest X-ray, CT chest, CT abdomen, CT brain or MRI brain, and bone scan.

          3. Patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by a fasting blood glucose
             value &gt;200 mg/dL, within 12 hours of PET scan.
