  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well antibiotics work in reducing chronic fatigue
      symptoms, such as tiredness, in patients that were treated for Lyme Disease. Fatigue is a
      common symptom of Lyme Disease. When fatigue does not improve after treatment, patients are
      considered to have Post Lyme Syndrome (PLS). The chronic fatigue seen in these patients
      appears to be related to the initial infection which causes Lyme Disease. It is believed, but
      not proven, that treatment with antibiotics may be effective in relieving chronic fatigue in
      PLS patients.

      You will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either antibiotics or a
      placebo (sugar pill). Neither you nor your doctor will know which you are receiving. You will
      learn to give yourself the injection, and you will remain on your study drug for 28 days. A
      home health care nurse will visit you twice a week to check the injection site, and at weeks
      1 and 3 the nurse will draw blood for laboratory tests. At months 1 and 6, you will be
      examined to see if you have fewer chronic fatigue symptoms after the antibiotics. This will
      include a fatigue questionnaire, a test of your mental processing speed, and a test of your
      cerebrospinal fluid.
