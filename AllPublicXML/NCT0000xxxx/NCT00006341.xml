      RATIONALE: The use of dentures and dental implants may help maintain chewing and speaking
      ability following surgery to remove tumors in the mouth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dentures and dental implants in
      maintaining the ability to chew and speak in patients undergoing surgery for mouth cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether conventional or implant supported dental prostheses and current
           surgical reconstructive procedures restore oral function and quality of life to
           pre-cancer surgery levels in patients with early oral cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a series of objective and subjective functional tests,
      questionnaires, and baseline examinations. Within 1-5 days, patients undergo the composite
      resection, including reconstructive surgery for the mandibulectomy group. Patients in the
      maxillectomy group receive an immediate maxillary surgical obturator. Approximately 6 weeks
      after ablative surgery, some patients receive radiotherapy for 5-7 weeks.

      Patients receive 2-4 implants at 12-16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or 8-16 weeks
      after ablative surgery. Patients then receive conventional dentures at 4-22 weeks after
      implant surgery. Implants are exposed during 27-48 weeks after placement and abutments
      connected for fabricating dental prostheses. Approximately 8 weeks are needed to fabricate
      the implant supported prosthesis.

      Patients complete quality of life and other questionnaires prior to and at 8-21 weeks after
      surgery, 16 weeks after conventional denture insertion, and then 16 weeks after implant
      supported prosthesis insertion.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (22 requiring maxillectomy and 40 requiring
      mandibulectomy) will be accrued for this study within 42 months.

    <description>A total of 62 patients with early oral cancer will be recruited; in addition, 22 patients requiring a partial maxillectomy and 40 requiring a partial lateral mandibulectomy will be enrolled. The mandibular defects will be reconstructed with fibula free flap surgery. Following a healing period, implants will be placed and permitted to heal unloaded for six months. Conventional dental prostheses will be fabricated and used by patients for at least 16 weeks during Phase I healing before the implants are exposed and loaded. A few weeks after Phase II surgery, the patients will receive implant-supported dental prostheses.</description>
