      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin and temozolomide
      in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin and temozolomide in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. II. Assess the safety of this cytotoxic
      combination in this patient population. III. Assess the preliminary evidence of efficacy of
      this combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide
      once daily on days 1-5. Carboplatin IV is administered over 1 hour on day 1. Courses are
      repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      toxicity and disease progression. Sequential dose escalation of carboplatin with a fixed dose
      of temozolomide is followed by sequential dose escalation of carboplatin at a higher fixed
      dose of temozolomide. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3-6 patients each continues until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxic effects. If the combination
      treatment with carboplatin given on day 1 of temozolomide therapy is more toxic than
      anticipated, then the study is repeated with carboplatin given on day 5 of temozolomide
      therapy. Patients are followed at least every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
