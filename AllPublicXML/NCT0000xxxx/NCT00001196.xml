  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with complaints of dry mouth to determine the cause and
      severity of their salivary gland dysfunction and their possible eligibility for other NIDCR
      protocols. Salivary gland secretions have antibacterial, lubricatory, remineralizing,
      digestive, buffering and cleansing properties. Impaired function of these glands can cause an
      increase in tooth decay; a variety of oral hard and soft tissue changes, with painful,
      burning, or ulcerated oral mucosal; problems chewing, swallowing, and speaking; and
      diminished taste and smell.

      Patients with dry mouth complaints suggestive of salivary gland dysfunction may be eligible
      for this study. In addition, patients with recent onset of arthritis may enroll. Patients
      with arthritis are at risk for developing a disorder called Sjogren's syndrome, in which the
      glands that produce saliva may be damaged.

      Participants will have a complete medical and dental history. Saliva samples will be
      collected from the major salivary glands, which are located in the cheeks and under the jaw.
      Several blood samples will also be drawn for tests. Some patients will have a biopsy of the
      minor salivary glands, usually from the lower lip, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of
      Sjogren's syndrome and determine the extent of changes in the salivary glands. The ability to
      taste and smell may also be evaluated, and patients may have an ultrasound examination of
      their swallowing function.

      Participants will have a complete medical and dental history. Saliva samples will be
      collected from the major salivary glands, which are located in the cheeks and under the
      tongue. Several blood samples will also be drawn for tests. Some participants will have a
      biopsy of the minor salivary glands, usually from inside the lower lip, to confirm or rule
      out the diagnosis of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and to determine the extent of changes
      in the salivary glands. An eye examination including a standard eye examination and a dry eye
      assessment is done. The ability to taste and smell may also be evaluated, and participants
      may have an ultrasound examination of their swallowing function.
