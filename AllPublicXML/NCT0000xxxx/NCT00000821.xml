  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of low-dose versus high-dose subcutaneous ( SC ) aldesleukin (
      interleukin-2; IL-2 ) on immunologic and virologic markers in HIV-infected patients. To
      compare the effects of monthly versus bimonthly administration of SC IL-2 on these markers.

      Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study,
      patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those
      with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive
      the greatest benefit.

      Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study,
      patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those
      with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive
      the greatest benefit.

      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms; patients receive either low-dose or
      high-dose SC IL-2 for 5 days either on a monthly or bimonthly schedule for approximately 6
      months.
