    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:

      To establish whether there is a difference in clinical effectiveness of Liposyn II 20 percent
      as compared with Liposyn III 2 percent in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
      (PCP). To compare the effects of the two lipid emulsions on immunologic function in AIDS
      patients. To compare the effect of the two lipid emulsions on HIV load in AIDS patients as
      measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) in culture. To determine whether a decrease in HIV
      infectivity is greater in patients given a parenteral feeding regimen containing Liposyn II
      20 percent or Liposyn III 2 percent.
