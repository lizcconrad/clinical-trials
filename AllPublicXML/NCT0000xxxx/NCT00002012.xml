      To conduct a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of an orally administered low dose interferon alfa-n3 as an
      immunomodulator in the treatment of mild to moderate symptomatic HIV+, AIDS-related complex
      (ARC) patients.
