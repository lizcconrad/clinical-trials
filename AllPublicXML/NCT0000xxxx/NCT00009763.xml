      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody
      therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for metastatic breast
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      therapy, cyclosporine, and paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody m170 in
           combination with cyclosporine and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or refractory
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody m170 (Y90 MOAB
      m170).

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily for 4 days prior to apheresis
      which continues daily for a maximum of 5 days. A minimum of 6 million CD34+ cells/kg must be
      harvested.

      Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25. Patients receive
      unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB
      m170 IV on day 0. On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB m170
      IV. Patients in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9.

      If needed, patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 21
      and receive G-CSF SC daily until blood counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
