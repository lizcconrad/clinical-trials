      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan and paclitaxel in treating
      patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of irinotecan administered in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent malignancies. II.
      Evaluate the toxicity and safety of this combination regimen in this patient population. III.
      Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of irinotecan in combination with paclitaxel on a
      weekly schedule and if the sequence of administration influences irinotecan pharmacokinetics
      in these patients. IV. Determine pharmacodynamic models of irinotecan and its SN-38 and
      SN-38G metabolites when administered in this weekly combination schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV
      concurrently with paclitaxel IV weekly. Patients demonstrating stable disease or partial or
      complete clinical response continue with treatment as long as dose limiting toxicities are
      not observed and adequate performance status is maintained. Cohorts of 3 patients receive
      escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose is determined or 150 mg/m2 is
      reached.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The first study cohort will receive 60 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on cycle days 1, 8, and 15 as a 1 hr infusion. Immediately following paclitaxel, 30 mg/m2 irinotecan will be administered as a 90 minute intravenous infusion. Irinotecan doses will be administered in an identical infusion schedule on days 8 and 15 of each treatment cycle.</description>
