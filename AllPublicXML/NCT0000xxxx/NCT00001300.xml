    <textblock>
      Randomized study. All patients must be randomized to treatment on Arms I and II within 3
      months of definitive surgery on Regimen A.

      Regimen A: Surgery followed, as indicated, by Radiotherapy. Amputation; or limb-sparing
      resection followed by involved-field irradiation using megavoltage equipment with or without
      electron boost.

      Arm I: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation and Urothelial
      Protection. Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Ifosfamide, IFF, NSC-109724; with Granulocyte
      Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF,

      NSC-614629; and Mesna, NSC-113891.

      Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities will undergo
      treatment of their primary tumor with either amputation or limb-sparing surgery and
      radiotherapy, and then be randomized to either observation or adjuvant treatment with
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with mesna (with G-CSF) for five cycles beginning
      post-operatively. Local recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival will be
      evaluated in this randomized two-arm trial.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        Histologically proven AR and ESFT which includes: Classical, atypical and extraosseous
        Ewing's sarcoma, primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, peripheral neuroepithelioma,
        primitive sarcoma of bone, and ectomesenchymoma.

        Confirmed presence of tumor-specific infusion protein by documented RT-PCR which
        corresponds to one of the tumor specific peptides available for vaccination.

        Measurable tumor.

        No prior or current CNS metastases.

        PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY:

        Arm A patients:

        May be enrolled on the protocol for the first phase in the absence of RT PCR documentation
        of a tumor-specific fusion protein which corresponds to one of the tumor-specific peptides
        available for vaccination. However, RT PCR documentation at the time of tumor recurrence
        must occur prior to administration of immunotherapy. At time of initial tumor diagnosis,
        prior to any cytoreductive therapy.

        Arm B patients:

        Tumor recurrence occurring during or after receiving at least first line cytoreductive
        therapy for ESFT and AR. No more than two post-recurrence salvage regimens unless
        peripheral CD4+T cell number is greater than 400 cells per millimeter cubed.

        At least 6 weeks since any treatments and recovered from all acute toxic effects from time
        in which immunotherapy will be started for this study.

        No concurrent estrogen therapy during immunotherapy section of study.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

        Age: 2-25 (at time of initial diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma).

        Weight: Greater than 15 kg (at time of apheresis).

        Performance status: ECOG 0-2.

        Life expectancy: At least 8 weeks.

        Hematopoietic:

        ANC greater than 100,000/mm3.

        Hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL.

        Platelet count greater than 50,000/mm3.

        Hepatic:

        Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL (unless related to involvement by tumor).

        Transaminases less than 3 times normal (unless related to involvement by tumor).

        Renal:

        Creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min.

        Cardiovascular:

        No major disorder of cardiovascular system.

        Cardiac ejection fraction greater than 40%.

        Pulmonary:

        No major disorder of pulmonary system.

        Other:

        Not pregnant or nursing.

        HIV negative.

        Hepatitis B or C negative.

        No patients requiring daily oral corticosteroid therapy.

        syndrome, ineligible to receive influenza vaccine.
