      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating patients who have
      hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DX-8951f in patients with advanced
      myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory acute myeloid or lymphocytic leukemia, refractory or
      transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase.
      II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen and determine the
      duration and reversibility of these effects in these patients. III. Make a preliminary
      determination of the antileukemic activity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily
      for 5 days. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of DX-8951f until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-25 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study.
