    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give
      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with peripheral stem cell transplantation works in treating older patients with refractory or
      relapsed intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the efficacy and toxic effects of carmustine/etoposide/melphalan (ICE)
           chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation in patients
           with refractory or relapsed intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Assess the ability of the ICE chemotherapy regimen, in conjunction with filgrastim, to
           mobilize peripheral blood stem cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a descriptive pilot study.

      Patients receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and
      etoposide (ICE). Each cycle is given at least 14 days apart. Patients receive etoposide IV on
      days 1 through 3. Carboplatin and ifosfamide with mercaptoethane sulfonate is given IV over
      24 hours on day 2.

      During cycles 1 and 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC every 6 hours beginning on day
      1 and continuing until the desired absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is attained.

      Patients receive at least 24 hours of rest before PBPC infusion on day 0.

      Following cycle 3, G-CSF is given SC beginning on day 6 and continuing until completion of
      PBPC collection. However, bone marrow will be harvested if an insufficient number of stem
      cells are collected after 5 leukaphereses.

      Patients with residual disease limited to 2 sites receive radiation therapy twice a day
      within 2 weeks prior to high dose BEAM chemotherapy with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine,
      and melphalan.

      Patients receive carmustine IV on day -7. Etoposide and cytarabine are given IV every 12
      hours on days -6 through -3. Melphalan is given IV on day -2.

      G-CSF is administered every 12 hours beginning on day 1 and continuing until the desired ANC
      is attained. If ANC is attenuated on day 21, patients undergo a repeat bone marrow biopsy and
      receive filgrastim SC.

      Patients are followed for 2 years posttransplant, then for 3 to 5 years at 4 month intervals
      and every 6 months following the fifth posttransplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients for the duration of 2 years.
