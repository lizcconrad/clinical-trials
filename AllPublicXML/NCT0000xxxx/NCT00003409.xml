      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Motexafin
      gadolinium may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making tumor cells more
      sensitive to radiation.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of motexafin gadolinium plus radiation
      therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of motexafin gadolinium in combination
      with radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the
      intratumoral pharmacology and quantitative pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium. Patients
      receive a loading dose regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV over 10-15 minutes on days
      1-5 or days 1-5 and 8-12 (cohort 7). After the loading dose regimen, patients receive a
      maintenance regimen comprising motexafin gadolinium IV 3 times weekly for a maximum of 6.5
      weeks. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks. Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive an escalating number of doses of motexafin gadolinium until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and
      then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
