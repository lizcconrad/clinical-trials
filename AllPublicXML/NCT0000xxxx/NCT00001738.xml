  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look for the presence in blood of a substance called vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) in patients with uveitis (eye inflammation). It will also look for this
      substance in eye fluid samples taken from patients with uveitis who are undergoing eye
      surgery.

      Some patients with uveitis experience some vision loss during an inflammatory attack because
      of swelling (edema) in a particular area of the retina called the macula, which is involved
      in visual acuity. It may be that VEGF is involved in the development of macular edema.

      Patients with uveitis who participate in this study will have about 10 cc (2 teaspoons) of
      blood drawn to be examined for VEGF. They will also undergo a procedure called fluorescein
      angiography to look at the blood vessels of the eye. A dye called sodium fluorescein is
      injected into the blood stream through a vein. After the dye reaches the blood vessels of the
      eye, photographs are taken of the retina.

      In addition, patients with uveitis who are undergoing eye surgery will have a tissue specimen
      (either aqueous fluid or vitreous gel) collected for examination for the presence of VEGF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased intraocular and systemic levels of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) is associated with new vessel growth in the eye, such as diabetic
      retinopathy. Recent work using immunopathologic techniques have shown that VEGF is
      upregulated in both experimentally induced uveitis and in uveitic eyes as well, with no
      evidence of neovascularization. This pilot study will evaluate the level of VEGF in the blood
      of uveitic patients with and without macular edema. This level will be determined also in the
      ocular fluid of those patients that are undergoing ocular surgery. These levels will be
      compared with age and sex matched controls.

        For Uveitis Patients:

        Evidence on ocular examination in the past or presently of intraocular inflammation, with
        cells and haze in the vitreous for the intermediate and posterior uveitis patients.

        In order to demonstrate the presence or absence of macular edema, a fluorescein angiogram
        will be attempted on all patients. However, if the patient is unable or not willing to
        undergo the test, then if two observers from the LI can substantiate independently that
        there is or is not evidence of cystoid edema, the patient may be included.
