    <textblock>
      The reason for doing this study is to see if cancer will respond to immune therapy after
      transplantation of blood stem cells (from the bone marrow) using a new kind of treatment
      regimen that is less toxic than that previously used for blood stem cell transplants. This
      type of transplant uses much less chemotherapy and radiation than standard bone marrow
      transplants. The treatment consists of medications that weaken the immune system so it
      doesn't reject the donor's marrow cells. Researchers hope that the immune cells from the
      donor will attack the tumor. This is called a &quot;graft versus tumor&quot; effect and has been seen
      in other types of cancer. In addition, 65 days or more after the transplant the patient may
      be eligible for an immune treatment that uses additional immune cells from the donor to
      increase the effect of the stem cells against the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether mixed or full donor hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established
      using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.

      II. To determine whether mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor hematopoietic
      chimerism by infusions of donor lymphocytes (DLI).

      III. To evaluate potential efficacy of this approach as a treatment for metastatic renal
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV once
      daily (QD) or BID on days -3 to 35 with taper to day 56, and mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV
      over 2 hours thrice daily (TID) on days 0-40.

      DLI: Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day 56 with no evidence of graft-vs-host disease
      (GVHD) may receive escalating doses of non-mobilized DLI over 30 minutes. Patients may
      receive up to 4 DLIs at escalating doses if there is disease progression with no evidence of
      GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
