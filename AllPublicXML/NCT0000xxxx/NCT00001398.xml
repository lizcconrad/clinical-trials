      This trial, sponsored by Amgen, Inc., which produces the recombinant methionyl human stem
      cell factor (r-metHuSCF), also involves two other institutions. The primary objective is
      determination of the safety of administering multiple doses of r-metHuSCF in the setting of
      acquired aplastic anemia and evaluation of the effect of r-metHuSCF on peripheral blood
      counts. Potential effects of r-metHuSCF on frequency of need for red cell or platelet
      transfusions and on bone marrow morphology/cellularity will also be evaluated.

        Acquired moderate or severe aplastic anemia.

        Intolerant to, or failure to durably respond to, ATG/ALG therapy with or without
        cyclosporin.

        Patients may not have received ATG/ALG, therapy for 12 weeks prior to enrollment or
        cyclosporin for 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Two years of age or older.

        Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or equal to 60 percent.

        Adequate organ function as defined by serum creatine less than 2.0 mg/dl and a bilirubin
        less than 2.0 mg/dl.

        Patients (or their parent[s]/responsible guardian[s]) must be able to comprehend and be
        willing to sign an informed consent prior to starting r-metHuSCF therapy.

        No current diagnosis or past history of myelodysplastic syndromes.

        No diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, or other congenital forms of
        aplastic anemia.

        No current diagnosis of clinically active paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) defined
        as patients with clinically significant thrombosis or hemolysis.

        No diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis.

        No treatment with ATG, ALG, or other immunosuppresive agents within 12 weeks of enrollment
        or treatment with cyclosporine A or IL-3 within 4 weeks of enrollment.

        No treatment with hematopoietic growth factors within 2 weeks of enrollment.

        No evidence of active uncontrolled infection.

        No known allergy to Ecoli-derived products.

        No current or recent symptoms of asthma occurring within the past 10 years (including
        allergic asthma, or asthma induced by cold temperature, infection, or exercise).

        No history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid-type event manifested by disseminated urticaria,
        laryngeal edema, and/or bronchospasm (or for example: food, insect bites, etc). Patients
        with drug allergies, manifested solely by rash and/or urticaria, are not excluded. An
        isolated episode of urticaria occuring more than 3 years earlier is not a contraindication.

        No significant nonmalignant disease including previously documented HIV infection,
        uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mmHg), unstable
        angina, congestive heart failure (greater than NY Class II), poorly controlled diabetes,
        coronary angioplasty within 6 months, or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac
        arrhythmias.

        No pregnancy or breast feeding. Those of childbearing potential must observe adequate birth
        control measures.

        No treatment with an investigational agent (other than hematopoietic growth factors) within
        4 weeks of study entry.

        No concurrent use of beta adrenergic blocking agents.

        No concurrent use, or use within the past 2 weeks, of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO
        Inhibitors).

        No psychiatric, addictive, or any disorder which compromises ability to give truly informed
        consent for participation in this study.
