  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new formulation of eye drops used
      to treat cystine crystals that form in the corneas of patients with cystinosis. Cystinosis is
      an inherited disease caused by a defective enzyme, in which excessive amounts of the amino
      acid cystine accumulate in the body. Among others, symptoms include poor growth and
      development of kidney failure. In addition, after 10 to 20 years, the cornea-the outside
      covering of the eye over the iris and pupils-becomes so packed with cystine crystals that
      small, painful breaks may develop.

      This corneal condition is treated with cysteamine eye drops. This study is designed to
      provide additional information about this medication that the Food and Drug Administration
      requires before approving it for marketing. The study will examine, in two separate but
      simultaneous investigations, the safety and effectiveness of a new cysteamine formulation. In
      both studies, before treatment begins, patients will have a complete eye examination, and
      photographs of the eye will be taken using a bright flash.

      Safety Study

      Children and adults currently enrolled in a cystinosis study at the National Institutes of
      Health may participate in this trial. They will receive the current cysteamine formulation in
      one eye and the new preparation in the other eye. The drops will be given every hour during
      waking hours. Patients will be observed daily for the first week of treatment and will be
      called at 2 weeks and 4 weeks to check on side effects, if any. At 6 months, they will
      undergo a repeat eye examination. Patients (or their parents) will keep a daily diary
      recording the condition of each eye.

      Effectiveness Study

      Children and adults from Ann Arbor, Michigan, LaJolla, California, and the NEI clinic may be
      enrolled in this study. Participants will receive medication as described above for the
      safety trial. They will be observed daily for the first week and will have repeat eye
      examinations, including photographs, at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 to see if the crystals have
      decreased. Patients will keep a daily diary of the condition of both eyes.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new formulation
      of cysteamine eye drops to treat children and adults with cystinosis and cystine crystal
      accumulation in the cornea. The safety of this new formulation will be evaluated among 30
      children and adults with a history of cystinosis under treatment at the NIH with the current
      preparation of cysteamine eye drops. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation
      in one eye and the new formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain,
      irritation, and itching will be evaluated in each eye at Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Month 6.
      Complete ophthalmic evaluation including corneal slit lamp examination with photographs will
      be performed at baseline and 6 months at the NEI Clinical Center.

      Efficacy will be evaluated among 15 patients (5 each from the NEI Clinical Center, Ann Arbor
      Michigan, and La Jolla, California) who have not received cysteamine eye drops prior to
      enrollment. Patients will be randomized to the current preparation in one eye and the new
      formulation in the other eye. Vision, blurring, redness, pain, irritation, and itching will
      be evaluated in each eye and a complete ophthalmic assessment including a corneal slit lamp
      examination with photographs will be performed at baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and
      Month 12. The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the improvement in the new formulation
      treated eye by 1.00 unit on a corneal photograph scale from 0.00 to 3.00 in 0.25 increments
      compared to the baseline grade. This scale grades the density and number of crystals in the
      cornea. The safety and efficacy studies will be conducted concurrently.
