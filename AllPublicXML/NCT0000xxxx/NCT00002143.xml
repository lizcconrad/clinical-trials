  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of acitretin in the treatment of psoriasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

      Etretinate, a retinoid, has proven successful in the treatment of HIV-infected patients with
      psoriasis, but it has an elimination half-life of 100 days. Acitretin, a metabolite of
      etretinate, has a much shorter half-life of 2 to 3 days. Acitretin has proven effective in
      treating psoriasis in patients without HIV infection by reducing skin involvement and
      clearing of the condition, but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in HIV-infected patients.

      clearing of the condition, but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in HIV-infected patients.

      Patients receive acitretin daily, with dose increases every 4 weeks based on quantitative
      assessment of the skin using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Treatment
      continues for a total of 20 weeks. Patients are followed every 2 weeks.
