      RATIONALE: ILX23-7553 may help solid tumor cells develop into normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of ILX23-7553 in treating patients who have
      solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of
      ILX23-7553 in patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the principal and dose
      limiting toxicities of this treatment regimen in terms of duration and reversibility in this
      patient population. III. Determine the preliminary evidence of antitumor activity with this
      treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX23-7553 for 5
      days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ILX23-7553 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 or 2 of 10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for
      at least 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
