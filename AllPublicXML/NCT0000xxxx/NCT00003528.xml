      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of raltitrexed in treating children with refractory
      acute leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of raltitrexed given for
      three weeks to children with refractory acute leukemia.

      II. Determine the incidence and severity of other toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Determine a safe and tolerable dose of raltitrexed, administered in this manner, to be
      used in phase II studies.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine if plasma
      2' deoxyuridine concentrations are associated with raltitrexed toxicity or pharmacokinetics.

      VI. Evaluate the antitumor activity of raltitrexed against recurrent leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive raltitrexed intravenously over 15 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks followed
      by 1 week of rest. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable
      toxicity.

      In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cohort of 6 patients treated,
      subsequent cohorts of 6 patients each receive escalating doses of raltitrexed on the same
      schedule. If DLT occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases
      and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years, then annually thereafter.
