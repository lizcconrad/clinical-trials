  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give MKC-442 plus
      stavudine (d4T) plus didanosine (ddI) plus hydroxyurea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive either MKC-442 or placebo, along with stavudine(d4T),
      didanosine(ddI), and hydroxyurea. Patients will be treated and followed for 48 weeks.
