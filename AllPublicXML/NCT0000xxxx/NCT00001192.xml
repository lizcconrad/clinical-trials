  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow researchers to use various types of tests to evaluate cognitive and
      sensory functions. These tests, referred to as &quot;batteries&quot; will evaluate attention, executive
      functions, general intellectual functioning, language, memory, motor functions, orientation,
      personality, selected sensory and perceptual functions, vigilance (alertness), and
      visual-spatial functions. Children and adult patient will receive different test batteries.

      The goals of this research study are to;

        1. Create descriptions based on the performance of each patient on the test batteries. Then
           use this information to relate patient behavior to their neurophysiological,
           neuroradiological, and biochemical descriptions.

        2. Define subgroups of patients based on their neurobehavior in order to decrease the
           variability of psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses.

      Neuropsychological tests are used to provide an assessment of cognitive functions in patients
      with idiopathic generalized epileptic (IGE) disorders and their first-degree relatives. The
      battery comprises tests designed to tap attention, memory, selected sensory and perceptual
      functions, vigilance, and visual-spatial functions. Modified batteries have been developed
      for the assessment of children ages 5-8, and children ages 8-16. The data provided by these
      batteries are compared with genetic profiles of the same participants that have been
      ascertained from blood samples analyzed by colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of
      Medicine/Columbia University in New York City.
