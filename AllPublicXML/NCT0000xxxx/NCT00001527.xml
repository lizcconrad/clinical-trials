  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful vasoconstricting peptide produced predominantly by vascular
      endothelial cells, that exerts its effect through the interaction with specific receptors,
      ETA and ETB, on the underlying smooth muscle cells. Previous studies in normal subjects have
      demonstrated an increase in forearm blood flow after ET-1 antagonism, suggesting a
      physiologic role of ET-1 in the regulation of basal vascular tone. However, whether
      ET-1-mediated tone is increased in hypertensive patients is unknown.

      The main purpose of this study will be to compare the forearm vascular responses to local
      infusion of ET-1 receptor antagonists between normotensive and hypertensive subjects in order
      to assess whether ET-1-mediated basal tone is increased in patients with hypertension. In
      addition, we propose to study the vascular responses to local ET-1 infusion to determine
      whether vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to this peptide is increased in hypertensive
      vessels. We will use both an ETA receptor antagonist, BQ-123, and an ETB receptor antagonist,
      BQ-788, in order to evaluate the relative contribution of the two receptor subtypes to the
      regulation of vascular tone.

      All drugs will be infused into the brachial artery and the responses of the forearm
      vasculature will be measured by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Because of the
      relative long-lasting effect of most of the substances to be infused, the study will be
      performed on two separate occasions.
