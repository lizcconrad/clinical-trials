  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level remains below a
      detectable level (less than 500/ml) after 24 weeks of study therapy with either 141W94
      monotherapy or 141W94 plus zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC). To determine the safety and
      tolerability of 141W94 monotherapy and the combination of 141W94 plus 3TC in patients with
      HIV infection.

      Although dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication is achieved with ritonavir or indinavir
      monotherapy, in both cases maximum suppression required combination treatment together with
      nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. This study tests the hypothesis that monotherapy with 141W94
      doses that result in Cmin levels far in excess of the IC90 corrected for plasma protein
      binding for HIV-1 can achieve the same virologic and immunologic effects in terms of
      magnitude and durability, as has been observed with combinations of other protease inhibitors
      plus nucleoside analogs.

      Although dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication is achieved with ritonavir or indinavir

      binding for HIV-1 can achieve the same virologic and immunologic effects in terms of
      magnitude and durability, as has been observed with combinations of other protease inhibitors
      plus nucleoside analogs.

      In this randomized, double-blind study, patients' HIV RNA is screened 30 days prior to entry.
      Patients satisfying enrollment criteria must have been on a stable antiretroviral regimen for
      30 days prior to study screening and remain on the same regimen until entry. Patients are
      stratified based on the screening HIV-1 RNA copy number obtained within 30 days of entry:
      5,000 - 50,000 copies/ml versus greater than 50,000 copies/ml. In addition, patients are
      stratified based on previous antiretroviral use: naive versus experienced. Patients are
      randomized to one of 2 treatment arms: Arm A - 141W94, plus Zidovudine (ZDV) and Lamivudine
      (3TC) or Arm B - 141W94, plus ZDV placebo and 3TC placebo.

      [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/25/97: Patients assigned to the monotherapy arm are advised to
      discontinue their study medication immediately and initiate antiretroviral therapy with
      indinavir, nevirapine, stavudine and 3TC, as outlined in ACTG 347 roll-over protocol, ACTG
      373. Patients in the three-drug arm continue on study therapy.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97:
      Patients receive study treatment for 56 weeks and are followed through week 68.]
