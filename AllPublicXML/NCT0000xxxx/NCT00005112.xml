  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disorder in America. Previous studies
      by our group and others have shown that human recombinant growth hormone (GH) improves height
      velocity, weight velocity, lean body mass (LBM) and pulmonary function. These positive
      results have prompted us to ask further questions regarding GH use in CF including: a) Do
      patients with better baseline body weight and pulmonary function derive more benefit from
      treatment than those with worse weight and pulmonary function?, b) Does GH use improve the
      patient's quality of life?, c) Once GH is discontinued, are the positive effects sustained?
      We hypothesize that GH treatment in CF patients will improve their clinical status and their
      quality of life. We further hypothesize that these effects will be present regardless of
      baseline body weight or pulmonary function, and that positive outcome will be sustained for
      at least one year after GH treatment is discontinued. To test our hypothesis, we will recruit
      40 prepubertal children from five CF centers across the United States (8 per center).
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with GH (0.3mg/kg/wk) during either
      the first or the second year. All subjects will be seen every three months. We will evaluate
      the following parameters every three months: 1) height, height velocity and Z-score, 2) body
      weight and weight velocity. Every six months we will measure: 1) lean body mass utilizing
      DEXA, 2) pulmonary function, including measurement of respiratory muscle strength (peak
      inspiratory and peak expiratory pressure), 3) quality of life (QOL), quantitated from QOL
      forms specific for CF (&quot;The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire&quot;). After one year of study,
      subjects will &quot;cross-over&quot; to the other treatment arm. This 24 month study will allow us to
      statistically compare outcome measures in 20 treated and 20 nontreated subjects from multiple
      centers, and will allow us to assess sustained effect in the 20 subjects who receive GH
      during the first year, by comparing their results to results obtained during the year post
      treatment.
