      RATIONALE: Ultrasound therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body
      temperature. This treatment may be effective for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy in treating
      patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer that has recurred following radiation
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of the Ablatherm high-intensity focused ultrasound
      device in providing control of disease for at least 12 months after treatment in patients
      with stage I or II prostate cancer recurring after external beam radiotherapy. II. Determine
      the safety of this treatment device in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. A probe is inserted into the rectum.
      Ultrasound energy is then delivered through probe to prostate tissue over 2-3 hours. Quality
      of life is assessed at study initiation; at 14 days and 3, 6, and 12 months; and then
      annually thereafter. Patients are followed at 14 days; at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage I or II prostate cancer Organ confined
        (T1 or T2) At least 1 current positive biopsy Failed prior external beam radiotherapy for
        T1-T2 prostate cancer within last 18 months (with no worsening of the cancer in the first
        12 months after radiotherapy) PSA nadir less than 4 ng/mL after external beam radiotherapy
        If prior hormonal therapy, PSA must be greater than 1.0 ng/mL and testosterone level normal
        after therapy Prostate volume no greater than 35 g, or 35-50 g if maximum anterior
        posterior diameter no greater than 2.5 cm Kattan Nomogram at least .50 60-month
        recurrence-free probability prior to external beam radiotherapy ASA Classification 1-3 No
        lymph node involvement by CT scan No metastases No prostate seroma, prostate abscess, or
        active prostatitis Must meet the following conditions: No artificial sphincter, penile
        prosthesis, or intraprostatic implant such as stent or catheter Normal rectal anatomy and
        rectal mucosa Rectal wall measurement no greater than 6 mm with treatment probe in place No
        calcification inducing a shadow in the prostate that would preclude study No significant
        rectal or bladder morbidity after radiotherapy (RTOG/EORTC rectal or bladder scores at
        least 2) No rectal fibrosis, stenosis, fistula, disease, or other rectal anomalies that
        would make rectal probe insertion difficult

        or other immunosuppression No known latex hypersensitivity Mentally coherent and capable of
        completing symptom and quality of life questionnaires No prior or concurrent illness or
