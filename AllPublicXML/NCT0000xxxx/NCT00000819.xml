  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of prednisone in patients with HIV-associated
      nephropathy. To determine the effects of prednisone on serum creatinine, urinary protein, and
      creatinine clearance.

      HIV-associated nephropathy is characterized by heavy proteinuria, rapidly progressive renal
      insufficiency, and distinct nephropathologic changes. The syndrome most often occurs in
      patients with advanced HIV disease. Little is known about the effects of corticosteroids on
      the progression of HIV disease. In light of the possible beneficial effects of
      corticosteroids on HIV-associated nephropathy, a controlled trial using prednisone is
      warranted.
