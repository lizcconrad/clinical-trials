      RATIONALE: Dystonia is a disorder in which the muscles that control voluntary movements are
      persistently or intermittently contracted (not relaxed). Deep brain stimulation is provided
      by a small, battery operated implant placed under the skin of the chest that delivers low
      voltage electrical pulses through a wire under the skin that is connected to a specific area
      of the brain. Deep brain stimulation may help lessen the symptoms of dystonia.

      PURPOSE: Phase II/III trial to study the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in treating
      patients who have dystonia.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery to implant a brain stimulation system consisting
      of an implanted pulse generator (IPG) in the chest and a wire lead in the globus pallidum
      internal. After the lead has been implanted, the brain stimulation system is tested. Patients
      are examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. A double blinded evaluation, during
      which the IPG is either off or on, is carried out at 3 and 6 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months as long as the brain stimulation system remains in
      place.
