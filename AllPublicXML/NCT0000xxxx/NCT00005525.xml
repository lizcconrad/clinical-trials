      To conduct a genetic analysis of anatomic risk factors for sleep apnea in a
      well-characterized United States population-based registry of elderly male twins who have
      been successfully followed for the past 30 years.

      BACKGROUND:

      The contribution of genetic factors to sleep disorders has been demonstrated in twin and
      family studies, and further understanding of the genetic underpinning of sleep disorders is
      considered an important area of research. Many of the suggested risk factors for sleep apnea
      (e.g.,craniofacial morphology, obesity) have genetic determinants. However, a formal genetic
      analysis of these anatomical risk factors with sleep-recorded physiological measurements has
      not so far been conducted.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators recruited a subsample of pairs from the NAS-NRC World War II Twin Registry
      in which at least one of the twin brothers reported sleep apnea symptoms and a subsample of
      control pairs in which both twins reported no symptoms. They monitoring the subgroup of twin
      pairs with overnight sleep recording. They also collected anthropometric measurements of
      weight, height, neck circumference, and craniofacial morphology and blood samples for
      determination of zygosity and DNA extraction for future molecular studies.

      The twin design is most powerful for estimating the genetic and/or environmental overlap
      between physiological measurements such as sleep-recorded disordered breathing, obesity, and
      craniofacial morphology. The investigators chose to focus on an elderly male twin sample for
      which a wealth of data relevant to this study had been previously collected. Twin pair
      concordance or discordance for monitored sleep-disordered breathing allowed the full
      characterization of genetic/familial and individual environmental factors associated with the
      expression and severity of this condition.
