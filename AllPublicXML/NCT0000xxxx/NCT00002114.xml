      To compare the efficacy and safety of orally administered Procysteine with placebo in
      HIV-infected patients who are receiving 1 of the following: (1) zidovudine (AZT) alone; (2)
      didanosine (ddI) alone; (3) AZT plus ddI; or (4) AZT plus zalcitabine (ddC).

      All patients must receive treatment with antiretroviral nucleosides in addition to study
      treatment. Patients are randomized equally into 1 of 3 outpatient dosage groups. Group 1
      receives placebo; Group 2 receives a low dose of Procysteine; and Group 3 receives a higher
      dose of Procysteine. Patients receive study treatment for 6 months (total duration of patient
      participation is 30 weeks).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Required:

        Antiretroviral nucleosides (AZT alone, ddI alone, AZT plus ddI, or AZT plus ddC). Regimen
        may be altered on or after Week 16.

        Allowed:

          -  Appropriate topical treatment or local radiotherapy for KS.

          -  Treatment or prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, including pentamidine,
             cotrimoxazole, acyclovir, fluconazole, etc., at the discretion of the investigator.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented serologic evidence confirming HIV infection.

          -  Ability to participate in an outpatient study for at least 26 weeks.

          -  Either:

          -  (a) diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) with CD4 count of 50 - 300
             cells/mm3, or (b) CD4 count of 50 - 200 cells/mm3 and no symptoms of AIDS
             (asymptomatic). (Note:

          -  Patients whose AIDS-defining condition is Kaposi's sarcoma alone must have CD4 count
             of 50 - 200 cells/mm3.)

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Evidence of organ involvement with CMV and/or positive blood cultures for
             Mycobacterium avium.

          -  Life expectancy less than 26 weeks.

          -  Malignancy or advancing Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with advancing or unstable skin lesion,
             or known or suspected visceral disease which requires systemic cytotoxic,
             myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

          -  Stage 2 or greater AIDS-dementia complex (ADC), defined as ability to perform basic
             activities of self-care but inability to work or maintain more demanding aspects of
             daily life as a result of an acquired decrease in cognitive CNS-related motor function
             characteristic of ADC.

          -  Psychological or emotional problems that prevent adequate compliance with study
             therapy.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Daily Vitamin C dosage greater than 1,000 mg or daily Vitamin E dosage greater than
             100 units.

          -  N-acetylcysteine, cysteine, or glutathione.

          -  Any investigational drug.

          -  Systemic chemotherapy.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of organ involvement with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or positive blood cultures
             for Mycobacterium avium.

          -  Intractable diarrhea, defined as greater than 4 bowel movements per day for at least 2
             weeks.

          -  History of seizures which have not been controlled with appropriate anticonvulsant
             medications within the previous 6 months.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any investigational agent or biological response modifier (including interferon or
             corticosteroids) within 1 month of study entry.

          -  Use of erythropoietin (EPO), G-CSF, or GM-CSF within 28 days of randomization.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:

        Active alcohol or drug abuse.

        Required:
