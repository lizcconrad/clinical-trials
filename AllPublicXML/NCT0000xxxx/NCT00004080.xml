      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's brain cells may improve the body's
      ability to fight cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of p53 gene therapy with SCH-58500 in
      treating patients who have recurrent, or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic
      astrocytoma, or anaplastic mixed glioma that can be removed during surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the efficiency of tumor cell transduction with adenovirus p53
      delivered stereotactically to patients with recurrent or progressive resectable glioblastoma
      multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or anaplastic mixed glioma. II. Determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of adenovirus p53 delivered stereotactically and with craniotomy in these
      patients. III. Correlate analysis of predelivery tumor specimen p53 gene status with
      postdelivery p53 gene status, clinical status, and tumor staging in these patients treated
      with this regimen. IV. Correlate analysis of postdelivery tumor specimen p53 gene status and
      local tumor immune response with postdelivery clinical status and tumor imaging in these
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive SCH-58500 via
      stereotactic injection into the tumor, followed 24-72 hours later by craniotomy. Patients
      undergo tumor resection, followed by injection of SCH-58500 into the tumor bed during
      craniotomy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCH-58500 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately preceding that
      at which 3 of 3-6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at day
      28, then every 2 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter, until another therapy is
      begun or disease progression is documented.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study over 14-27
      months.
