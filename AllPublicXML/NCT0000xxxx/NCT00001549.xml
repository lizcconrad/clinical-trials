  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of neurological conditions. Patients
      participating in this study will continue receiving medical care, routine laboratory tests,
      and diagnostics tests (X-rays, CT-scans, and nuclear imaging), from their primary care
      physician. Doctors at the NIH plan to follow these patients and offer advice and assistance
      to their primary care physicians.

      The objective of this protocol is to provide diagnosis and follow Experimental Therapeutics
      Branch (ETB) patients not currently entered on another research protocol. No investigational
      treatments will be administered on this protocol, and the NIH physicians will be playing
      largely a consultative role to the patient's primary physician.
