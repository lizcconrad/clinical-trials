      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bexarotene in treating
      patients who have metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of oral bexarotene (LGD1069) at two different dose levels
      in patients with advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this
      treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral bexarotene
      in terms of induction of differentiation and decreased aberrant cell proliferation in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to prior therapy for metastatic disease. Patients are randomized to one of two dose
      levels. All patients receive oral bexarotene once daily. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every week for the
      first month, at weeks 6 and 8, then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-180 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer No CNS
        metastases No rapidly progressing visceral disease Previously irradiated lesions(s) may be
        designated as measurable indicator tumor(s) only if more than 6 months since radiotherapy,
        patient has no other measurable disease regrowth, and bidimensionally measurable regrowth
        is documented within 2 months prior to study Stratum 1 (hormonal): Must be hormone receptor
        positive (ER or PR) Prior hormonal therapy only allowed for metastatic disease Must have
        progressed on last hormonal regimen Must have at least one bidimensionally measurable tumor
        Stratum 2 (chemotherapy): Hormone receptor positive or negative Must have progressed on or
        after prior chemotherapy (1-2 regimens) for metastatic disease (bone marrow transplant
        counts as 2 regimens) Prior hormonal therapy allowed Must have at least one bidimensionally
        measurable tumor Stratum 3 (tamoxifen): Must be hormone receptor positive (ER or PR) and
        progressing on tamoxifen No symptomatic visceral metastasis if on adjuvant tamoxifen at
        time of systemic recurrence Must have at least one bidimensionally measurable tumor, or
        lytic bone lesion which measures at least one cm in diameter Hormone receptor status: See
        above

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Menopausal status: Not specified Performance status:
        ECOG 0-2 OR Karnofsky 60-100% Life expectancy: At least 3 months Hematopoietic: WBC at

        1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT and/or SGPT no greater than 2.5 times ULN
        Concurrent medication with drugs that significantly alter hepatic metabolism (e.g.,
        phenobarbital, phenytoin, oral azole antifungals) allowed only if dosage stable Renal:
        Creatinine less than 2 times ULN OR Creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/min Concurrent
        medication with drugs that significantly alter renal metabolism (e.g., probenecid) allowed
        only if dosage stable Other: At least 5 years since any other prior invasive malignancy
        except basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin No serious concurrent illness
        that would prevent compliance No history of or clinically significant risk factors for
        developing pancreatitis Fasting triglycerides within normal range Not pregnant or nursing
        Fertile patients must use effective contraception

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Prior monoclonal antibody HER2 therapy for
        metastatic disease allowed only if combined with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and

        least 4 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (at least 6 weeks since prior mitomycin or
        nitrosourea) No prior retinoid therapy for breast cancer At least 3 months since any other
        prior retinoid therapy except topical application for dermatological indications No
        concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 2 weeks

        chronic low dose hormone replacement therapy or low dose corticosteroids for noncancer
        indication Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics Prior radiotherapy allowed Concurrent
        radiotherapy allowed only to non-indicator tumor(s) that do not represent new disease or
        disease progression Surgery: Prior surgery allowed Other: At least one month since prior
        investigational therapy (except hormonal) No other concurrent investigational therapy
        Concurrent medication with drugs that significantly alter hepatic metabolism (e.g.,
        phenobarbital, phenytoin, oral azole antifungals) allowed only if dosage stable No more
