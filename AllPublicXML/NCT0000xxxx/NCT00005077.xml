      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who
      have advanced cancer plus liver dysfunction.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced
      malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of hepatic
      dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxaliplatin in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      liver function as defined by the following: Group A: Normal liver function - Bilirubin, SGOT,
      and alkaline phosphatase no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) Group B: Mild liver
      dysfunction - Bilirubin no greater than ULN; SGOT greater than ULN to 2.5 times ULN and/or
      alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN to 5 times ULN Group C: Moderate liver function -
      Bilirubin greater than ULN to 3.0 mg/dL and/or SGOT greater than 2.5 times ULN and/or
      alkaline phosphatase greater than 5 times normal Group D: Severe liver dysfunction -
      Bilirubin greater than 3.1 mg/dL and any SGOT or alkaline phosphatase Group E: Patients who
      have received a liver transplant Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in groups B, C, and D receive escalating doses of
      oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose- limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
