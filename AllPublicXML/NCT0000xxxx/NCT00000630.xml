  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if priming (giving the first vaccination) with a vaccinia recombinant (HIVAC-1e)
      provides a significant advantage in immunogenicity (production of antibodies) compared to
      priming with a soluble recombinant protein (gp160); to learn more about the safety of the
      combination use of the two HIV envelope vaccines utilized in the study.

      Recent studies at the AIDS vaccine units have shown the safety of two candidate HIV vaccines,
      HIVAC-1e and gp160. Specific questions to be addressed in this part of the study include:
      Does combination vaccination result in a synergistic (added) response not predicted by just
      the addition of a second vaccination, and does this synergism depend on the unique priming
      effect of a vaccinia recombinant, or will any combination do?

      Recent studies at the AIDS vaccine units have shown the safety of two candidate HIV vaccines,

      Does combination vaccination result in a synergistic (added) response not predicted by just
      the addition of a second vaccination, and does this synergism depend on the unique priming
      effect of a vaccinia recombinant, or will any combination do?

      Volunteers will be randomized to one of four groups. Group A (20 volunteers) will receive
      gp160 (VaxSyn) followed two months later by a repeat dose. Group B (20 volunteers) will
      receive VaxSyn followed two months later by HIVAC-1e. Group C (20 volunteers) will receive
      HIVAC-1e followed two months later by VaxSyn. Group D (10 volunteers) will receive HIVAC-1e
      followed two months later by HIVAC-1e. For volunteers in Groups A, B, and C who do not react
      to the initial vaccination, a second attempt to obtain a reaction may be made 7 or more days
      following the initial inoculation. Per addendum, two additional booster inoculations are
      given: one at 6 months or later post initial inoculation (Groups A, C, and D receive VaxSyn
      and Group B receives HIVAC-1e) and another at 12 months or later (all Groups receive VaxSyn).
