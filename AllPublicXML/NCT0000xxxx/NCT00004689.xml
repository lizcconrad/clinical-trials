      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the bacteriological activity of amithiozone against Mycobacterium
      avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease.

      II. Define the ability of amithiozone to improve clinical outcomes in patients with MAC
      infection.

      III. Determine the safety and tolerance of amithiozone with chronic dosing in these patients.

      IV. Assess the contribution of clarithromycin, streptomycin, rifampin, ethambutol, kanamycin,
      and amithiozone in the treatment of pulmonary MAC infection.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: The is a randomized, open label study. All patients receive a core regimen
      of clarithromycin and streptomycin. Patients are randomized into two treatment arms. Arm I
      patients receive rifampin and ethambutol. Arm II patients receive amithiozone.

      Patients are followed for one year to detect any relapse or other complications.

      Patients not eligible for this randomized study may be entered on a short open label study
      with amithiozone.
