      To compare the safety and tolerance of oral ganciclovir at a double dose 3 times/day or a
      single dose 6 times/day to IV ganciclovir given for 20 weeks of maintenance therapy. To
      compare the time to progression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis between two regimens of
      oral ganciclovir and IV ganciclovir therapy given for 20 weeks of maintenance therapy. To
      describe the efficacy and safety of double dose versus single dose oral ganciclovir in
      patients who have a progression of retinitis while on the originally assigned maintenance
      treatment. To describe the safety, tolerance, and time to progression of retinitis during the
      52 weeks of oral ganciclovir maintenance therapy in people with AIDS. To describe the safety
      and tolerance of oral ganciclovir maintenance therapy when given concurrently with
      antiretroviral treatment (e.g., zidovudine, ddI, or ddC). To describe survival of people with
      AIDS and CMV retinitis.

      Two hundred twenty-five patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis are eligible for enrollment in
      Groups A, B, and C of the study, provided that each subject has received and tolerated a
      therapeutic course of intravenous (IV) ganciclovir of at least 4 weeks duration resulting in
      stable retinitis. An additional 100 subjects who have received and tolerated a course of IV
      or oral ganciclovir under any clinical trial of oral ganciclovir sponsored by Syntex Research
      and have stable retinitis may enter into Group D of this study and receive oral ganciclovir.
