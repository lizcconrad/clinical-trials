  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TNFR:Fc (a molecule that attaches to TNF) can
      lower the amount of IL-6 in HIV-positive patients. This study will also examine the effect of
      TNFR:Fc on TNF-alpha. IL-6 and TNF-alpha are 2 substances produced by the immune system that
      may increase the rate of HIV replication.

      IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced naturally by the body. High levels of TNF-alpha lead to
      increased IL-6 production and increased HIV replication, therefore helping the virus infect
      the body. HIV-positive patients who receive IL-2 (interleukin-2, a protein that helps the
      immune system fight infection) tend to have higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha than patients
      not receiving IL-2. These increased levels may contribute to some of the flu-like symptoms
      related to IL-2 administration. TNFR:Fc can neutralize TNF-alpha to decrease the action of
      TNF-alpha and, in turn, decrease the amount of IL-6 in the body. TNFR:Fc may, therefore, have
      a role in the treatment of HIV disease or in relieving some of the symptoms related to IL-2
      administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are substances
      naturally produced by the body's immune system. Evidence suggests that TNF-alpha production
      may be excessive or inappropriate in HIV-infected patients. Elevated TNF-alpha levels can
      result in increased IL-6 production and possibly increased HIV replication. TNFR:Fc is a
      modification of a natural substance that binds to TNF-alpha and neutralizes its activity. It
      is postulated that TNFR:Fc may result in decreased activity of TNF-alpha and lower IL-6
      levels. HIV-infected patients who receive Interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been shown to have higher
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels than those who do not receive IL-2. It is thought that these higher
      levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 may contribute to some of the flu-like symptoms experienced by
      patients receiving IL-2. By decreasing the amount of IL-6 in the body and by decreasing the
      action of TNF-alpha in the body, TNFR:Fc may have a role in the treatment of HIV disease or
      in alleviating some of the symptoms related to IL-2 administration.

      Six patients from each of the 3 treatment arms of ACTG 328 (HAART alone, HAART plus
      intravenous (IV) rhIL-2, and HAART plus subcutaneous (SC) rhIL-2) who are about to be
      randomized to Step II of ACTG 328 may participate in this prospective, nested substudy.
      Patients randomized to the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) arms of ACTG 328 are pretreated with TNFR:Fc
      (administered by infusion over 30 minutes) at week 16 of ACTG 928 (Course 3, Week 28 of ACTG
      328), just prior to initiation of IL-2. Those randomized to the highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) only arm of ACTG 328 receive treatment with TNFR:Fc at Week 16 of ACTG 928
      (Week 28 of ACTG 328).
