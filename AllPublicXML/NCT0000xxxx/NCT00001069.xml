  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To compare the clinical efficacy of two decision making strategies for initiating or
      changing antiretroviral therapy: decision making based on current clinical practice alone
      (i.e., initiating or changing therapy based on CD4 count decline and/or clinical progression)
      versus decision making based on plasma HIV RNA quantitation in addition to current clinical
      practice.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate toxicity, biological markers, and patient management in the two arms.

      Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines
      are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is
      indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for
      monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive
      antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible
      will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and
      HIV-related symptoms.

      Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines
      are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is
      indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for
      monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive
      antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible
      will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and
      HIV-related symptoms.

      Patients are randomized to a decision making strategy for initiating or changing therapy
      based on current clinical practice alone vs. decision making based on plasma HIV RNA
      quantitation in addition to current clinical practice in patients with &lt;= 300 CD4+ cells/mm3.
      All patients in the RNA arm as well as a subset (n = 183) of those in the CCP arm will have a
      plasma HIV RNA quantitation drawn every 4 months. The results of these quantitations will be
      blinded until the end of the study. CD4 counts will be obtained at least every 4 months if
      the previous count was &gt; 20 cells/mm3. The remaining patients in the CCP arm will have CD4
      counts obtained according to their clinicians' current clinical practices. Medications,
      clinical status, and changes in antiretroviral therapy will be recorded for all patients in
      the study. Patients are stratified by CD4+ cell count (&lt;100 cells/mm3 [200 patients] vs.
      100-300 cells/mm3 [900 patients]).
