  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction are useful in the
      management of patients with heart disease. Several imaging methods exist, but are limited by
      cost, invasiveness, or exposure to radio-isotopes. Conventional echocardiography is a
      noninvasive method that allows estimation of left ventricular size and function; however,
      quantitative measurements of volume are not widely used due to lack of reproducibility and
      inaccurate measurements. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is a new technique that
      can be used to derive volume measurements from a single image acquisition. We hypothesize
      that real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate method for making left
      ventricular volume measurements. We therefore propose to measure left ventricular volumes
      using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in human subjects and correlate these
      measurements with magnetic resonance imaging, a more accurate noninvasive method for
      obtaining these measurements.
