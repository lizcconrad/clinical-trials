      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of peripheral stem cell transplantation
      plus combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the complete and partial response rates to treatment with peripheral
      blood stem cell supported high dose carmustine and melphalan followed by consolidation
      therapy with dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin (DCEP) and dexamethasone,
      paclitaxel, and cisplatin in patients with poor prognosis low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia and no greater than 12 months of prior standard therapy. II.
      Evaluate the incidence of early deaths (less than 60 days posttransplant) in comparison with
      historical experience in this patient population. III. Evaluate the toxicity of
      posttransplantation chemotherapy with DCEP and dexamethasone, paclitaxel, and cisplatin in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2 and melphalan IV on day -1
      followed by peripheral blood stem cell infusion on day 0. At 3 months and 9 months after
      completion of autologous transplantation, patients receive cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
      cisplatin by continuous IV infusion for 4 days plus dexamethasone orally every day for 4
      days. At 6 and 12 months after completion of autologous transplantation, patients receive
      dexamethasone orally every day for 4 days, paclitaxel continuous IV infusion over 6 hours on
      day 2, and cisplatin continuous IV infusion over 24 hours on day 3.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 12-35 patients accrued into this study over 1-2.5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed low grade follicular lymphoma, mantle
        cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia with no greater than 12 months of prior
        standard therapy Follicular lymphoma Must have poor prognosis disease defined as any of the
        following: Any nodal or extranodal tumor mass with a diameter more than 7 cm Involvement of
        at least 3 nodal sites, each of which has a diameter greater than 3 cm Systemic symptoms
        Substantial splenic involvement no greater than 5 cm below left costal margin Serous
        effusions (ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions) Orbital or epidural involvement
        Ureteral compression Leukemia presentation (at least 500/microliter) Increased LDH level
        Greater than 20% bone marrow involvement Mantle cell lymphoma No mantle zone morphology
        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Must have either anemia (hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL),
        thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/mm3), cytogenetic abnormalities including +12 and 11q,
        elevated LDH levels, labeling index at least 2%, systemic symptoms, or hepatosplenomegaly
        No active CNS disease A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been
        adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the
        former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this
        protocol uses the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 to 70 Performance status: SWOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: At least 4,000/g CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells available See
        Disease Characteristics Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Transaminases no
        greater than 4 times upper limit of normal No active chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis
        Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: Left ventricular ejection
        fraction at least 50% Pulmonary: FEV1, FVC, and DLCO at least 50% of predicted Other: HIV
        negative No active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics Not pregnant or nursing
        Effective contraception required of all fertile patients

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks
        since prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Prior corticosteroids allowed Radiotherapy: At
        least 4 weeks since prior local radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified
