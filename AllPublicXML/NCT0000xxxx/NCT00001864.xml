  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the results of two standard treatments for amblyopia
      in order to find out if one is more effective than the other. Amblyopia, which develops in
      childhood, is also called &quot;lazy eye,&quot; because one eye is not being used properly. The brain
      favors the other eye for some reason, such as crossing or turning out of the eyes, and vision
      in the weak eye is reduced.

      Amblyopia is treated by forcing the child to use the weak eye. There are two ways to do this:
      1) a patch placed over the &quot;good&quot; eye forces the child to use the weak eye; or 2) an eye drop
      placed in the &quot;good&quot; eye once a day to blur vision in that eye makes the child rely on the
      weak eye. The success rates with both of these methods have been reported to be about the
      same; this study will try to identify if one is more effective than the other.

      Children will be randomly assigned by computer to one of the following two treatment methods:

      Patch

      The child initially will wear a patch over the &quot;good&quot; eye for 8 to 12 hours every day. If
      vision in the weak eye improves, the patching time will be decreased. If vision remains good
      after 3 months, the patching will be stopped, unless the child's doctor believes treatment
      should continue. If vision in the weak eye does not improve, the patching time will be
      increased.

      Eye Drops

      The child will be given one drop per day of atropine in the &quot;good&quot; eye. If vision in the weak
      eye improves, the drops will be given less often. If the vision remains good after 3 months,
      the drops will be stopped, unless the child's doctor believes treatment should continue. If
      the initial daily drop does not improve the vision in the weak eye, the child's eyeglasses
      may be changed to try to further blur the vision in the &quot;good&quot; eye.

      After 6 months, treatment may be stopped if it has not been successful. If treatment has been
      successful after 6 months, it may be continued at a reduced amount or stopped.

      Follow-up visits will be scheduled every 4 weeks for the first 6 months and every 2 to 4
      months after that until the end of the 2-year study. During each visit the eyes will be
      examined for eye movements and vision, and the pupils will be dilated to examine the inside
      of the eye.

      The Amblyopia Treatment Study (ATS) has been designed as a randomized, controlled
      single-masked multi-center clinical trial with the following objectives:

      To determine whether the success rate with atropine treatment of amblyopia due to strabismus
      or anisometropia in patients less than 7 years old is equivalent to the success rate with
      occlusion (patching) therapy.

      To develop more precise estimates of the success rates of amblyopia treatment.

      To identify factors that may be associated with successful treatment of amblyopia.

      To collect data on the clinical course of treated amblyopia to provide more precise estimates
      of treatment kinetics than now available.
