      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody
      BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate and low-dose total-body irradiation
      followed by donor stem cell transplant and immunosuppression therapy in treating older
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes that cannot be
      controlled with treatment. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131
      monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them.
      Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It
      may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem
      cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer
      cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against
      the body's normal cells. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy together with
      fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered via 131I-BC8 antibody
      (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8) when combined with the non-myeloablative regimen of
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) + cyclosporine
      (CSP)/mycophenolate (MMF) in elderly patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      II. To determine the rates of donor chimerism resulting from this combined preparative
      regimen, and to correlate level of donor chimerism with estimated radiation doses delivered
      to hematopoietic tissues via antibody.

      III. To determine, within the limits of a phase I study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      IV. To assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      131I-BC8 (24 Gy) in order to gain more confidence that the DLT rate is acceptable at this
      level.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 intravenously
      (IV) on day -12 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2. Patients undergo total-body
      irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on
      day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or IV twice daily (BID) on days
      -3 to 56 with taper to day 80 (for patients with a related donor) OR days -3 to 100 with
      taper to day 177 (for patients with an unrelated donor) in the absence of graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV thrice daily (TID) on
      days 0 to 27 (for patients with a related donor) OR on days 0 to 40 with taper to day 96 (for
      patients with an unrelated donor) in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.
