      OBJECTIVES: I. Collect data regarding the natural history of hereditary hemorrhagic
      telangiectasia (HHT).

      II. Establish genotype-phenotype correlations in HHT. III. Create a database of information
      for researchers throughout the world.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients complete a self-administered natural history questionnaire in a
      multiple choice format. Questionnaire is completed by a population consisting of males and
      females of all ages and ethnic backgrounds.

      Data are collected and made available to all researchers.
