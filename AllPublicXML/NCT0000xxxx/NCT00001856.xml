  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a yearly basis there are approximately 12,000 kidney transplants in the United States.
      Presently there are approximately 40,000 patients awaiting a transplant with only 5,000
      available donors. Due to the obvious difference between organ supply and demand, live donors
      have become a standard source of kidneys for transplantation.

      Research has proven that kidneys from living donors are superior to cadaveric donors (kidneys
      harvested from a deceased individual). Kidneys from living donors are not exposed to
      extremely low temperature that could increase post-operative problems. They are less likely
      to experience rejection and there is a decreased likelihood that a patient will have to
      undergo post-operative dialysis.

      The objective of this study is to promote the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as
      kidney donors for patients undergoing research kidney transplantation at the NIH. Potential
      donors will be screened to make sure they are able to survive with a single kidney without
      significant medical risk. Additional tests will be taken to establish compatibility with the
      recipient. Compatible donors will be evaluated to determine which kidney is suitable for
      transplantation. Both the donation and transplantation procedure will be conducted on the
      same day. Appropriate post-operative care and follow-up will be provided at the Clinical
      Center....

      This protocol is designed to facilitate the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as
      renal allograft donors for subjects undergoing protocol renal transplantation at the NIH.
      Donation will be allowed for altruistic purposes only.
