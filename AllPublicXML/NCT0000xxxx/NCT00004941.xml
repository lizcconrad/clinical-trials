      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared with placebo in
      closure of enterocutaneous fistulae in patients with Crohn's disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to investigational site and number of fistulae (single vs
      multiple).

      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an infusion
      of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) on weeks 0, 2, and 6. Arm II: Patients receive an
      infusion of cA2 on weeks 0 and 2, and an infusion of placebo on week 6. Arm III: Patients
      receive an infusion of placebo on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, and 6.

      Patients are followed every month for 3 months, then every 6-12 months for up to 2 years.
