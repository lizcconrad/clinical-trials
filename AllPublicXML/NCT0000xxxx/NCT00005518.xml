      BACKGROUND:

      The major hypothesis of this study is that suppression of immunoregulatory cytokines will
      prevent factor VIII inhibitor formation in the hemophilia A murine model: if successful, a
      treatment protocol could be developed for individuals identified to be at highest risk for
      inhibitor formation. Through this approach to the epidemiology and immunology of inhibitor
      formation, the health care of individuals with hemophilia may be improved.

      The study is in response to a Request for Applications released in 1998 on the Immunogenetics
      of Inhibitor Formation in Hemophilia. .

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A case-control study is conducted comparing prevalent hemophilia patients with inhibitors
      identified in the HMS Study with three age-matched controls without inhibitors to determine
      clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with inhibitor development. A
      histocompatibility study is conducted identifying patterns of HLA Class II antigens by
      molecular typing in hemophilic subjects identified in HMS, with and without inhibitors, which
      may be linked to inhibitor formation. An animal tolerance study is conducted in the
      hemophilia A murine model, evaluating blockade of T cell costimulatory pathways by CTLA4-Ig
      and anti-CD40L mAb, to prevent inhibitor formation.
