  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis can be caused by an infection with a
      virus, but poisonous (toxic) substances can also cause it. Researchers have identified
      several of the viruses responsible for hepatitis, however some patients with hepatitis show
      no evidence of being infected with known hepatitis viruses. Researchers call conditions like
      this, seronegative hepatitis. It means that a patient has hepatitis but he/she does not have
      evidence in their blood of a viral infection.

      Seronegative hepatitis is often complicated by autoimmune disorders and associated severe
      disorders especially, fulminant hepatitis of childhood and post-hepatitis aplastic anemia.

      Researchers have attempted to identify the cause of these conditions but have been
      unsuccessful. Therefore, this study was developed to collect blood and stool samples from
      patients with seronegative hepatitis in order to help identify the virus responsible.

      While several viruses have been identified as agents of liver inflammation, some proportion
      of cases of acute hepatitis are seronegative and show no evidence of prior infection with
      known hepatitis viruses A, B, C, or E. Seronegative acute hepatitis is often complicated by
      autoimmune phenomena or late severe consequences, especially fulminant hepatitis of childhood
      and post-hepatitis aplastic anemia. Efforts in the Hematology Branch to identify an
      infectious agent in these latter two syndromes have been unsuccessful, probably because they
      are immune-mediated and also accompanied by massive tissue destruction. We now propose
      systematic collection of blood and fecal samples from patients with seronegative acute
      hepatitis for purposes of virus identification research. Samples will be collected from
      patients in United States Army clinics; patient identifiers will be employed.
