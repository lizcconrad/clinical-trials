  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and compare the long-term (48-177 weeks) safety, tolerance, and efficacy of two
      doses of zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) taken orally every 8 hours in children with
      symptomatic HIV infection who have one of the following: intolerance to zidovudine ( AZT )
      (development of toxicity during prolonged AZT therapy), demonstrated disease progression
      after 6 months of AZT therapy, OR both AZT intolerance and disease progression after 6 months
      of AZT therapy.

      As useful as AZT appears to be in the treatment of patients infected with HIV, it is
      associated with significant toxicity in some patients, and it does not prevent ultimate
      progression to AIDS and eventual mortality. Thus, there is a clear need for new
      antiretroviral drugs, and ddC is one such promising agent.

          -  Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg up to 5 days/week).

          -  Prophylaxis treatment as per ACTG recommendations for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

          -  Acyclovir (up to 1000 mg/day PO; for &gt; 1000 mg/day PO or for any IV dose, suggest

          -  Aspirin, acetaminophen, sedatives, and barbiturates (for up to 72 hours).

          -  Isoniazid (INH), if there is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy at entry. Children
             should receive pyridoxine, 25

          -  50 mg/day to avoid possible INH-associated neuropathy.

          -  Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (T/S).

          -  Immunoglobulin therapy.

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine.

          -  Drugs with little nephro-, hepato-, cytotoxicity that the patient has been taking and
             tolerating well for an ongoing condition.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Immunoglobulin therapy.

          -  Nutritional support (for children with wasting syndrome and/or malnutritional)
             including hyperalimentation (TPN) of dietary supplements.

        AMENDED:

          -  Patients enrolled in ACTG 051 may participate in ACTG 138 if they show intolerance to
             AZT or show disease progression after 6 months of AZT therapy and meet entry criteria
             for the study.

        ORIGINAL design:

          -  Patients enrolled in ACTG protocols 051 or 128 must meet study end points or meet
             protocol definitions for being permanently off zidovudine (AZT) before enrolling in
             this protocol.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Absence of acute opportunistic infection at time of entry.

          -  However, if patient is successfully treated for opportunistic infection and has
             remained stable for 2 weeks after treatment, the patient is then allowed to enter the
             study. Children receiving maintenance therapy for &gt; 4 weeks are eligible.
