      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody in treating
      patients who have acute myelogenous leukemia that did not respond to standard treatment given
      in clinical trial PDL 195-301.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 as
      demonstrated by frequency of complete remission (CR) in patients with acute myelogenous
      leukemia with regimen failure on the control arm of PDL Study 195-301. II. Determine
      additional evidence of clinical benefit of this treatment as demonstrated by frequency of
      partial remission (PR), durations of CR and PR, and progression free and overall survival in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 (MOAB
      HuM195) IV over 4 hours on days 1-4 every 2 weeks for 4 courses. Patients without disease
      progression after completion of course 4 continue to receive MOAB HuM195 as above. Treatment
      repeats every month for a maximum of 8 additional courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
