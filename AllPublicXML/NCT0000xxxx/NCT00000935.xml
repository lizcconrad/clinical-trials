  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the clinical and laboratory observations that suggest IVIG
      given before and after kidney transplant to patients who are sensitized (highly sensitive) to
      certain transplant antigens could result in reduced sensitization and reduced rates of kidney
      rejection.

      Some ESRD patients are highly sensitive to certain transplant antigens (foreign substances
      that activate the immune system) and must wait for a long time before a well-matched kidney
      becomes available. Transplant rejection is more likely among highly sensitized patients than
      in patients who are not highly sensitized. There is no proven method to improve a
      highly-sensitized patient's chances of receiving and keeping a transplanted kidney.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD). However, many patients do not receive this treatment due to immune sensitization to
      HLA antigens. IVIG has been shown to somewhat reduce anti-HLA antibody activity. By blocking
      this activity, IVIG may make transplants more feasible and increase graft survival in
      transplant recipients.

      Patients are randomized to receive IV infusion of either 2 g/kg (maximum dose 180 g) IVIG 10%
      S/D (Gamimune-N, 10%, manufactured by Bayer) or placebo (0.1% human albumin, manufactured by
      Bayer) at time of dialysis at study entry and monthly for 3 months. If patients have not
      received a transplant at 1 year, they receive a &quot;booster&quot; dose of IVIG or placebo; patients
      receive another booster at 24 months if transplant still has not occurred. If transplant
      occurs, patients receive 2 g/kg (up to 180 g) IVIG or placebo monthly for 4 months, beginning
      at time of transplant. Before and after initiation of IVIG/albumin placebo treatment,
      specific immune parameters, including panel reactive antibodies (PRA) levels, MLR, serum
      inhibition of MLR, and cytokine gene transcription in the MLR, and AECA levels are measured.
      Outcomes studied include time on dialysis and graft survival rates.
