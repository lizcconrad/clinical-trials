      This study will test whether the drug combination of methotrexate and infliximab
      (anti-TNF-alpha antibody) is more effective than methotrexate alone for treating rheumatoid
      arthritis early in the disease. (The Food and Drug Administration has approved both treatment
      regimens for patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.) The study will also evaluate
      how effectively magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect differences in the development of
      bone damage in the two treatment groups by as early as 6 months.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had rheumatoid arthritis for less than 2 years
      and who have four or more affected joints may be eligible for this 1-year study. Patients
      must have received methotrexate treatment in the past without complete success, and must not
      have been treated previously with Anti-Thymocyte therapy.

      All participants will receive 20 Mg./week of methotrexate. In addition, patients will be
      randomly assigned to receive a monthly infusion of infliximab or placebo (a fluid that
      contains no active drug). After 6 months, all patients will receive active infliximab for the
      remaining half year of the study. Patients will also receive folic acid (1mg/day), Vitamin D
      (400 IU/day), and calcium supplements. They may continue to take prednisone (no more than 10
      Mg./day) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Medication dosages will be
      adjusted as needed if pain and joint swelling worsen. Over the course of the study, patients
      will come to NIH for 15 visits and undergo the following tests and procedures:

        1. Joint examination-at every visit.

        2. Drug side effects evaluation-at every visit during the study and after the study at 24
           and 36 months by questionnaires to be filled out and returned.

        3. Hand and feet X-rays at the first visit, at 6 months and at 12 months.

        4. MRIs of the wrist to examine damage in the bone and synovial tissue (tissue lining the
           joint)-before treatment begins and at weeks 15, 27 and 54. For this study, the patient
           lies still in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) with a strong magnetic field. A contrast
           material (gadolinium) is injected into the blood to enhance the images of the synovium.
           The MRI takes about 45 minutes.

        5. DEXA scans (dual emission X-ray absorptiometry) of the lower spine, one hip and one
           wrist to measure bone density and assess bone loss-before treatment begins and at weeks
           27 and 54. This X-ray test takes about 5 to 10 minutes.

        6. CTs (computed tomography) of one hand to assess joint damage in the wrist-before
           treatment begins and at weeks 27 and 54. Only half the patients in the study will have
           this X-ray study, which produces 3-dimensional images of the hand. It will be done to
           compare the location, size and change of damage in the wrist seen on CT with the
           information obtained on MRI. The procedure takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

        7. Blood tests-at every visit to evaluate treatment response and side effects.

    <textblock>
      The current 'gold standard' of measuring osseous damage in patients with RA in the context of
      clinical trials is the radiographic evaluation of hands and feet. However, conventional
      radiographs are insensitive to change and extended trial duration is required to reliably
      document differences of this important surrogate endpoint in the different treatment arms. In
      this active treatment controlled double blind trial in patients with erosive RA we want to
      test whether a very sensitive imaging modality, MR images of a typically involved joint, the
      wrist, can detect differences in the formation of erosions in the two treatment arms with
      fewer numbers of patients at 6 months. We plan to enroll a total of 60 patients into the
      study, allocating 20 into methotrexate/placebo arm and 40 into a methotrexate/infliximab arm.
      The anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab in combination with methotrexate has been
      shown to retard the development of bone erosions on conventional radiographs in patients with
      established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at one year. We are proposing to use MRI of the most
      severely involved wrist as a highly sensitive imaging modality to assess differences in the
      development of new erosions significantly earlier, at 3 and 6 months (primary endpoint) in
      the two treatment arms. After 6 months, all patients will receive open label treatment of
      methotrexate in combination with infliximab for an additional 6 months followed by a one year
      evaluation. We will use MRI again to assess if abnormalities at 6 months are still present at
      12 months. Concomitantly we will evaluate the use of bone and cartilage markers as well as
      endocrine and metabolic markers before and after treatment with infliximab.
