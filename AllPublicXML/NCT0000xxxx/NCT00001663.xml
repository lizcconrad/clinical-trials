  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myoclonus is a condition related to epilepsy of involuntary twitching or jerking of the
      limbs.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if stimulation of the brain with magnetic pulses
      can decrease myoclonus. Researchers believe that this may be possible because in studies on
      normal volunteers, magnetic stimulation made areas of the brain difficult to activate for
      several minutes. In addition, early studies on patients with myoclonus have shown magnetic
      stimulation to be effective at decreasing involuntary movements.

      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to
      stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when
      studying the areas of the brain and spinal cord related to motor activity (motor cortex and
      corticospinal tract). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the
      placement of coil of wire (electromagnet) on the patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and
      off the electrical current. The changing magnetic field produces weak electrical currents in
      the brain near the coil. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the
      surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending
      upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

      Researchers plan to use rTMS for 10 days on patients participating in the study. The 10 day
      period will be broken into 5 days of active repetitive magnetic stimulation and 5 days of
      placebo &quot;ineffective&quot; stimulation. At the end of the 10 day period, if the results show that
      rTMS was beneficial, patients may undergo an additional 5 days of active rTMS.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at frequencies in the single Hz range
      causes a decrease in the excitability of the primary motor cortex and there is preliminary
      evidence that it can suppress abnormal excess cortical activity. We plan to test 1 Hz rTMS as
      treatment for cortical myoclonus.
