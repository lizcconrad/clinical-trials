      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin plus bryostatin 1 in treating
      patients who have advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of combination
      bryostatin 1 and cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced, incurable solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. The first 4 cohorts of patients receive an
      escalating dose of cisplatin with a fixed dose of bryostatin 1, followed by 5 cohorts
      receiving an escalating dose of bryostatin 1 and a fixed dose of cisplatin. In the first
      course, cisplatin is given as a 2 hour infusion followed by a 24 hour continuous infusion of
      bryostatin 1. In all subsequent courses bryostatin 1 is given first and cisplatin afterwards.
      Treatment continues every 21 days in patients with stable or responding disease. Dose
      escalation proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination chemotherapy is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are
      treated at this dose level. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
