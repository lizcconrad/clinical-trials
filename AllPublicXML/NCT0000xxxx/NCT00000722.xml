  <brief_summary>

      To compare the use of pentamidine aerosol (inhaled mist) with the standard intravenous method
      of administration in patients with AIDS related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), to
      measure the amount of pentamidine aerosol that actually reaches the lung, and to see if close
      clinical observation is safer and as effective as drug therapy in the prevention of PCP
      recurrences. To compare the efficiency of 2 nebulizers - the Respirgard II nebulizer and the
      Cadema Aerotech II nebulizer. Aerosolized pentamidine was as effective as intravenous
      pentamidine in treating PCP in animals. More of the pentamidine reached the lungs and less
      was found in the liver and kidney after pentamidine was given by aerosol than after an
      intravenous injection. This suggests that the toxicity of pentamidine may be less if given by
      aerosol than if given by the intravenous route.

      Aerosolized pentamidine was as effective as intravenous pentamidine in treating PCP in
      animals. More of the pentamidine reached the lungs and less was found in the liver and kidney
      after pentamidine was given by aerosol than after an intravenous injection. This suggests
      that the toxicity of pentamidine may be less if given by aerosol than if given by the
      intravenous route.

      Patients will inhale one dose of radiolabeled aerosol containing pentamidine, and an image of
      the lung will be taken immediately and then 24 hours later to determine the amount of
      pentamidine reaching the various areas of the lung. Patients will then undergo a
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in order to recover the PCP organism from the lung and to
      corroborate the diagnosis of PCP. If PCP organisms are detected, patients will be randomly
      assigned to aerosolized or intravenous pentamidine and treated for 21 days. Patients taking
      pentamidine by aerosol will repeat the radiolabeled aerosol study on day 9. The BAL will be
      repeated at the end of therapy for all patients. If patients do not improve within 9 days,
      they will be switched to another therapy. After completion of therapy, patients will be given
      the option of prophylactic therapy, i.e., doses of medication to prevent reinfection, for
      PCP. All patients will be carefully assessed every 4 weeks for 6 months whether they begin
      prophylactic therapy or not. Zidovudine (AZT) may not be taken during the 21-day trial
      because of the increased risk of side effects, but it can be resumed when PCP therapy is
      completed.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP); zidovudine.

        Unequivocal diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) established by morphological
        confirmation of three or more typical Pneumocystis carinii organisms in bronchoalveolar
        lavage fluid, obtained immediately following the initial inhalation of radiolabeled
        aerosol.

          -  Resting (A-a) DO2 &lt; 30 torr on room air or resting (A-a) DO2 = or &lt; 55 torr on room
             air with a serious intolerance to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX), defined
             as one or more of the following:

          -  Platelets &lt; 50000 platelets/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count (polys plus bands) = or &lt;
             500 cells/mm3 on at least two occasions = or &gt; 12 hours apart.

          -  Blistering rash, mucosal involvement, generalized maculopapular eruption, or
             intolerable pruritus.

          -  Transaminase &gt; 5 x ULN or = or &gt; 300 IU if baseline is abnormal.

          -  Daily temperature = or &gt; 103 degrees F beginning after the 5th day of treatment and
             persisting for at least 3 days and not responsive to antipyretic therapy, with no
             other discernible cause.

          -  Any other severe or life-threatening adverse reaction to TMP / SMX that, in the
             investigator's opinion, makes continued or recurrent treatment with TMP / SMX
             inadvisable (approved on a case-by-case basis by the NIAID clinical monitor).
