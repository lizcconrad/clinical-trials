      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analog in treating
      patients who have advanced kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma when treated
           with rebeccamycin analogue.

        -  Assess the quantitative and qualitative toxicities associated with this drug in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 30-60 minutes daily for 5 days.
      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-18
      months.
