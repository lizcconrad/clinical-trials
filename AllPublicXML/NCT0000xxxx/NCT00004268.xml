      OBJECTIVES: I. Study further the safety and efficacy of the alpha-receptor agonist midodrine
      in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.

      II. Assess the quality of life in these patients with this treatment regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a partially randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive oral
      midodrine three times a day during weeks 1 and 3-5, then either oral midodrine or placebo for
      weeks 6-8.

      Quality of life is assessed at weeks 3, 6, and 8.
