      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus estramustine in
      treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of weekly paclitaxel plus estramustine on PSA response in
      patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Describe the toxic effects
      of this treatment in this patient population. III. Determine the effect of treatment on pain,
      asthenia, and quality of life. IV. Determine the objective response rate after treatment
      among the patients with bidimensionally measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive estramustine orally twice a day on days 1-3 of each week for 6
      weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 of each week for 6 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.
      Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment and at weeks 4, 8, 20, and 24. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 2-5, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-52 patients accrued into this study over 14 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-refractory
        adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland Elevated serum acid phosphatase or PSA levels must not
        be only evidence of disease Must have evidence of progressive metastatic disease (e.g.,
        bone, pelvic mass, lymph node, liver, or lung metastases) Radiological evidence of
        hydronephrosis alone does not constitute evidence of metastatic disease Patients with bone
        metastases only (i.e., lacking measurable soft tissue disease) must have PSA level of at
        least 20 ng/mL Patients with soft tissue metastases and/or visceral disease must have
        either bidimensionally measurable disease or a PSA level of at least 20 ng/mL Must have had
        prior treatment with bilateral orchiectomy or other primary hormonal therapy (e.g.,
        estrogen therapy, LHRH-blocker plus flutamide, etc.) with evidence of treatment failure No
        carcinomatous meningitis or brain metastases

        appropriate for cure of specific cancer No other serious concurrent illness or active
        infection Effective contraception required of all fertile patients

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior
        chemotherapy (including neoadjuvant chemotherapy) Endocrine therapy: See Disease
        Characteristics At least 6 weeks since prior bicalutamide At least 4 weeks since prior
