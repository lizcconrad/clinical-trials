  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of oral zidovudine (AZT) when given over a period of 24
      weeks to children between 3 months and 12 years of age. The effectiveness of AZT in treating
      HIV infection in infants and children will also be evaluated.

      HIV infection in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor
      prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in altering the course of the
      disease and decreasing mortality in these children. AZT has been shown to be effective in
      certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that infected
      children may also benefit from this treatment.

      children may also benefit from this treatment.

      The participants receive AZT mixed with juice at a dose dependent on body size every 6 hours
      for 24 weeks. The children are evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks, every two weeks for
      the subsequent 8 weeks, and monthly thereafter. Blood samples are collected periodically and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture on 2 occasions.
