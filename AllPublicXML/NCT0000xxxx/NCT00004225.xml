      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's
      ability to fight cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy plus radiation therapy in
      treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of adenovirus p53 gene therapy and
           radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with or without prior
           radiotherapy to the indicator lesion(s).

        -  Determine p53 and p21 expression and induction of apoptosis and necrosis in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess any vector incorporation, antitumor response, local control, viral dissemination,
           and development of adenovirus antibodies in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior radiotherapy to the
      indicator lesion(s) (yes vs no).

      Adenovirus p53 is injected directly into an endobronchial lesion via bronchoscopy or into
      locoregional tumors via multiple percutaneous punctures under fluoroscopic, ultrasonic, or CT
      scan guidance on days 1, 3, and 8. Patients undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 2 and
      continuing for a total of 10 days.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
