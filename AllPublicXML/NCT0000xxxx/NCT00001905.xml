    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug, interferon gamma, in
      treating leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD I). Patients with this inherited immune
      disorder do not have enough proteins called adhesion molecules on their infection-fighting
      white blood cells, impairing the ability of these cells to get to the site of infection. As a
      result, patients have recurrent infections of soft tissues, such as the skin, gums and
      gastrointestinal tract, and poor wound healing. Infants with severe LAD I often die from
      multiple infections. Interferon gamma may increase the number of adhesion molecules on white
      blood cells, and thus improve their function.

      Patients with LAD I who weigh more than 13 kilograms (28.5 pounds) may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will have personal and family medical histories taken, a physical
      examination, blood and urine tests and a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan.

      Participants will receive injections of interferon gamma under the skin 3 times a week for 3
      months. Adult patients will be taught how to give their own injections (similar to insulin
      injections for diabetes) and parents will be taught how to administer the shots to their
      child. Blood samples, usually be between 30 to 90 milliliters (2 to 6 tablespoons), will be
      drawn just before starting medication and again 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 4 months
      after therapy begins. At these same time intervals, patients will provide a salt-water mouth
      rinse specimen, which will be tested for changes in the number of white blood cells during
      interferon gamma treatment.

      Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for inpatient evaluations at the start
      of therapy and again after 1 week, 1month, 3 months and 4 months. The initial screening visit
      will take a few days and subsequent visits will take 1 to 2 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD I) is a primary immunodeficiency disease resulting
      from mutations in the gene encoding CD18. Markedly reduced or absent expression of the
      leukocyte integrin component CD18 causes significant impairment in leukocyte mobilization to
      inflammatory sites. Clinically, patients have marked leukocytosis and recurrent infections
      involving soft tissues such as skin, the gastrointestinal tract and gingiva. Death due to
      infections in early infancy is common with the severe form of LAD I (CD18 expression less
      than 0.5%), but patients with the moderate phenotype (CD18 expression 1-10%) may survive into
      young adulthood. To date, therapy consists of antibiotic treatment for infections and bone
      marrow transplantation when possible. LAD I is also a candidate for future gene therapy.
      Recently, it has been shown that in vivo administration of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
      upregulates CD18 expression in normals and alters leukocyte trafficking. We hypothesize that
      modest increases in CD18 expression in LAD I patients with the moderate phenotype or
      alterations in CD18 independent trafficking could result in detectable clinical changes and
      possible clinical improvement.
