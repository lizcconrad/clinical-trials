  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and tolerance of an increasing number of infusions per week of
      alvircept sudotox ( sCD4-PE40; soluble CD4-Pseudomonas exotoxin ) at a fixed dose when
      administered to HIV-1-infected individuals. To investigate the effect of sCD4-PE40 on the
      following parameters: T lymphocyte subsets, plasma HIV RNA and cellular HIV proviral DNA in
      PBMC and CD4 cells, p24 levels, serum beta-2 microglobulin, and neopterin levels.
