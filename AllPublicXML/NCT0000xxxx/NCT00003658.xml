      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin,
      cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or
      other B-cell cancers that have been treated previously.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose of cyclophosphamide, with filgrastim (G-CSF) support, that can be
           safely administered with pentostatin and rituximab in patients with previously treated
           intermediate- or high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other low-grade B-cell
           malignancies. (Phase I closed to accrual effective 11/27/2001.)

        -  Characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of response in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cyclophosphamide (CTX).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive CTX IV followed by pentostatin IV on day 1 of course 1.
           Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 3
           and continuing until blood counts recover. During the second and subsequent courses,
           patients receive CTX IV, pentostatin IV, and rituximab IV on day 1. Patients also
           receive G-CSF as in course 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at least a
           partial response after the third course receive an additional 3 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CTX until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      (Phase I closed to accrual effective 11/27/2001.)

        -  Phase II: Patients receive CTX at the recommended phase II dose and treatment as above.

      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year and then periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study. (Phase I closed to accrual effective 11/27/2001.) A total of 14-30 patients will be
      accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 2.5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Intermediate- or high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as defined by the
             three-stage Rai system

               -  Rai intermediate disease must be active disease (including weight loss, fatigue,
                  fevers, evidence of progressive marrow failure, splenomegaly, progressive
                  lymphadenopathy, and progressive lymphocytosis with a rapid doubling time)

          -  Other low-grade B-cell neoplasms, including small lymphocytic lymphoma (and its
             variants), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and follicular lymphoma allowed

             adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace
             the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However,
