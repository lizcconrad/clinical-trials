  <brief_summary>

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.
      Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body
      temperature. Combining hyperthermia with chemotherapy and interferon alfa may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of cisplatin, gemcitabine,
      interferon alfa, and whole-body hyperthermia and how well they work in treating patients with
      metastatic, recurrent, or refractory cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity and tumor response in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or
           refractory malignancies treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine, interferon alfa, and
           long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia (LL-WBH).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cisplatin.

        -  Phase I and II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 8. Patients
           receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 15, followed by subcutaneous interferon alfa on
           days 16 and 17. Patients undergo long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia
           over 6 hours plus gemcitabine over 30 minutes on day 17. Courses repeat every 5 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
           which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The MTD of
           cisplatin is used for phase II study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
