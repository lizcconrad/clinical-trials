  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety, tolerance, and steady-state pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of
      935U83 administered to patients with HIV infection. To obtain preliminary evidence of
      antiretroviral activity of 935U83. To prospectively evaluate the emergence of in vitro drug
      resistance. To determine the effects of 935U83 dosing on CD4+ cell counts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (10 per dose level) are randomized to receive 1 of 4 doses of 935U83 every 8 hours
      for 12 weeks. Five patients at each dose level must complete 4 weeks of treatment without
      serious toxicity before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose. If lack of
      antiretroviral effect or unacceptable toxicity is demonstrated at a particular dose level,
      the dose regimens may be adjusted.
