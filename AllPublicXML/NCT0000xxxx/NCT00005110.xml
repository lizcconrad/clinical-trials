  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term use of bronchodilators in CF is beneficial to the improvement of pulmonary function
      and symptoms. This study is investigating the long-term benefit of administration of the drug
      Salmeterol, a bronchodilator. Salmeterol will be compared to albuterol or placebo. The
      medication will be inhaled twice a day for 6 months.

      Patients that have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and are above 5 years and below 45
      years of age are eligible. Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups. One group will get
      Salmeterol by multi-dose inhaler (MDI) 2 puffs 2 times a day, one group will get albuterol by
      MDI 2 puffs 2 times a day and the other will get placebo by MDI 2 puffs 2 times a day. Height
      and weight along with pulmonary function testing and vital signs will be monitored at the
      beginning of the study and at Visits 2, 3, and 4. Peak flow monitoring will be done each
      morning before study medication at home. A daily diary will be kept of this measurement.
      Subjects will be seen in the research center at visits 1,2,3, and 4. Telephone contact will
      be done at Day 15, 60, 120, and 150. Individual outcomes include a potential increase in
      pulmonary function testing and a decrease in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations,
      hospitalizations, and usage of antibiotics.
