      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MS 209 plus docetaxel in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral MS-209 when given with docetaxel IV in
           patients with advanced solid malignant tumors.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of MS-209.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of a 3 week course. On day 1 of the 2nd
      course, patients receive MS-209 orally followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour. Treatment is
      repeated every 3 weeks for 4-7 courses (including course with docetaxel alone). Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-209 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
