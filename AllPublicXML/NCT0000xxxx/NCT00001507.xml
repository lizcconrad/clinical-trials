      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel
      (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), followed by high-dose melphalan and etoposide for
      treating inflammatory breast cancer. Patients also receive infusions of their own previously
      collected progenitor cells (primitive cells that can make new cells to replace ones destroyed
      by chemotherapy).

      Patients 18 years of age or older with stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer that has not
      metastasized (spread beyond the breast) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and chest
      x-ray. They have computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as a
      bone scan to determine the extent of disease, and a nuclear medicine scan called MUGA to
      examine the heart's pumping ability. They may receive a rehabilitation medicine evaluation.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Central venous line placement: Patients have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed
           into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line remains in the body
           throughout treatment and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to
           withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the
           radiology department or the operating room.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive two or more cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide.
           Paclitaxel is given intravenously (I.V., through a vein) for 72 hours using a portable
           pump. Cyclophosphamide is given daily for 3 days I.V. over 1 hour. The cycles may be 28
           days apart. A drug called Mesna is given with this treatment to protect the bladder from
           irritation from cyclophosphamide. Patients who have not previously been treated with
           doxorubicin (Adriamycin) may receive a maximum of four cycles of doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide by vein on a single day during each cycle, with cycles 21 days apart.
           When all the paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycles are completed, patients receive
           melphalan and etoposide, both drugs I.V. over 1 to 8 hours for three consecutive days.

        -  G-CSF treatment: After each paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle and after the
           melphalan/etoposide treatment, patients are given a drug called G-CSF. G-CSF, injected
           under the skin, stimulates production of infection-fighting white blood cells.

        -  Apheresis: This is a procedure to collect progenitor cells for later reinfusion. For
           this procedure, blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm
           vein. The blood is circulated through a cell-separating machine, where the white cells,
           including the progenitor cells, are extracted, and the red cells are returned to the
           patient through another catheter in the other arm. Apheresis is done after each of two
           cycles of paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide.

        -  Progenitor cell transplant: Progenitor cells are reinfused after melphalan/etoposide
           treatment.

        -  Glucose infusion: A salt solution with chemically modified glucose is infused I.V. over
           a period of from 12 to 48 hours, with subsequent donation of blood cells for blood and
           immune system studies. Patients have a maximum of two glucose infusions, separated by at
           least 3 months.

        -  Tumor biopsy: Some patients have a biopsy of their tumor (removal of a small piece of
           tumor tissue for microscopic study) before starting chemotherapy.

        -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn frequently to monitor safety and treatment response, and for
           research purposes.

        -  Dental consultation: Some patients may have a dental consultation before the progenitor
           cell transplant.

      BACKGROUND:

      Efforts to cure high-risk breast cancer have increasingly focused on the application of dose
      intensive chemotherapy. To date, the use of dose intensive and high-dose chemotherapy has not
      significantly changed the survival for the majority of high risk and metastatic patients. The
      optimal schedule and combination of agents to improve the results of high-dose chemotherapy
      is not known. This study will pilot a combination of chemotherapy agents for the treatment of
      Inflammatory Breast Cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To define, in a statistically relevant manner, the clinical efficacy of this chemotherapy
      regimen combination in the treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage IIIB inflammatory).

      To examine the effects of this high-dose chemotherapy on T-cells (T-cell number, phenotype,
      cytokine profiles) and study the process of post-chemotherapy T-cell regeneration.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Newly diagnosed patient with non metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage III B).

      The patients treated in this study will also be eligible for entrance into other protocols of
      the experimental Transplantation &amp; Immunology Branch that are examining strategies of
      manipulating T-cell regeneration in adults after intensive chemotherapy.

      DESIGN:

      Patients will receive multiple cycles of a dose intensive combination of Paclitaxel and
      Cyclophosphamide both for the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and with
      therapeutic intent. A second induction regimen will consist of four cycles of the combination
      of Doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide. Patients will subsequently receive high-dose Melphalan and
      Etoposide followed by the infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells and granulocytes
      colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF).

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age greater or equal to 18 years.

        All patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of Inflammatory Breast
        Carcinoma stage III B. Patients with no clinical inflammatory signs but with tumor invasion
        of dermal lymphatic on histology are eligible. Patients with metastatic disease and
        Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma are not eligible. All pathologic material must be reviewed
        and confirmed by the Department of Pathology of the treating institution prior to treatment
        (there will be no central pathology review).

        Patients may be untreated or may have received prior induction chemotherapy outside the
        NCI. If patients received prior induction chemotherapy, they may not have been unresponsive
        to it. They may have received chemotherapy either before (neo-adjuvant setting) or after
        local surgery (adjuvant setting).

        Karnofsky performance status of greater than 70% (ECOG 0 or 1).

        Ejection fraction by MUGA or 2-D echocardiogram within institution normal limits.

        Creatinine clearance of greater than 60 cc/mm.

        AST and ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of normal.

        Bilirubin less than 1.5 (except in cases of Gilbert's disease).

        ANC greater than l000/mm(3).

        Platelet count greater than 90,000/mm(3).

        DLCO greater than 50%.

        No history of medical or psychiatric disease which would preclude safe treatment in the
        view of the principal investigator.

        Patients with Inflammatory Breast Cancer but with metastatic disease.

        Any patient may be excluded from this study at the discretion of the principal investigator
        if it is deemed that allowing participation would represent an unacceptable medical or
        psychiatric risk.

        Any patient with a need for chronic steroids or anticoagulation will be ineligible.

        Any patient testing positive for HIV (AIDS) or hepatitis B or C will be ineligible.

        Any female patient known or found to be pregnant will be considered ineligible. Patients of
        childbearing potential unwilling to practice contraception will be ineligible.
