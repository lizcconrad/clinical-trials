      OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate clinical outcome with cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with
      Huntington's disease (HD) and their at-risk relatives.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of cerebral glucose metabolism in observing the pathophysiologic
      development of HD, monitoring responses to experimental therapy, and predicting HD genotype.

      III. Identify, define, and describe the natural history of pathophysiologic lesions in HD.

      IV. Characterize the genotypic and phenotypic expression of the HD gene.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are screened for Huntington's disease, including cerebral
      glucose metabolism assessment and genetic testing.

      Studies include a detailed family history and neurologic, psychometric, and neurobehavioral
      evaluations. Imaging includes positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose and brain
      magnetic resonance imaging.

      A genotype assessment is performed; genetic results are not disclosed to patients or
      relatives.
