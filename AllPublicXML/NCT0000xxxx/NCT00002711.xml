      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and recommend a phase II dose for
      paclitaxel (TAX) when administered as a 96-hour intravenous infusion with a weekly fixed dose
      of intravenous cisplatin (CDDP) during concurrent radiotherapy for patients with localized
      esophageal cancer. II. Estimate the response rate of patients treated with 2 courses of
      TAX/CDDP induction chemotherapy and the complete response rate of patients treated with
      TAX/CDDP and concurrent radiotherapy. III. Describe the toxic effects of TAX/CDDP prior to
      and during radiotherapy. IV. Describe the pharmacokinetics of TAX as a continuous infusion
      (CI) over 96 hours. V. Evaluate, by flow cytometry, the ability of CI TAX to block esophageal
      cancer cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle.

      OUTLINE: After the MTD of TAX is reached on Part A, new patients are entered on Part B. The
      following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 EBRT External-beam radiotherapy TAX
      Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), NSC-125973 PART A: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy. EBRT using megavoltage equipment (&gt;/= 10 MV recommended; electron boost allowed
      for subclavicular fossae); plus TAX/CDDP. PART B: 2-Drug Combination Induction Chemotherapy
      followed by Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. TAX/CDDP; followed by EBRT as
      in Part A; plus TAX/CDDP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients/dose will be entered on Part A (up to 24 patients) and
      3-6 patients on Part B.
