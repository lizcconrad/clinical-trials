  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To quantitate in an HIV-infected population the percentage of patients demonstrating the
      &quot;booster&quot; phenomenon (attainment of a positive response to a second tuberculin purified
      protein derivative skin test when the first skin test was negative); to determine the
      relationship between the booster phenomenon and CD4-positive lymphocyte cell counts; to
      detect any relationship between the booster phenomenon and HIV exposure category.

      The accuracy of skin testing to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) infection is
      dependent upon the host's ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction;
      however, the DTH response may be impaired or absent in patients with impaired cell-mediated
      immunity, a classic characteristic of HIV infection. Patients in whom immunity is diminished,
      but not absent, may test negative the first time a purified protein derivative skin test for
      MTb is administered, but if the same skin test is repeated, a positive DTH response may then
      be elicited. This occurrence is known as the &quot;booster&quot; phenomenon.

      Patients who have had a negative purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test for M.
      tuberculosis within 7-28 days prior to study entry will receive a second PPD test by the
      Mantoux method (5 TU intradermally to the volar aspect of the forearm). Skin tests will be
      read 48-72 hours after application. Patients with a positive skin test (defined as an
      induration, or small hard knot, of 5 mm or greater forming beneath the skin) will be referred
      to their primary physicians for further evaluation.
