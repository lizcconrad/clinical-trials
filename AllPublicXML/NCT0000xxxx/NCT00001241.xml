  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the level of gastric acid is elevated. This
      increased level of gastric acid is what causes the symptoms of the disease. Certain types of
      medication can control the secretion of gastric acid. In this study there are details on how
      drugs known as antihistamines (H2 receptor antagonists) can control the levels of gastric
      acid secretion.

      The study describes; which patients are candidates for this research, what to do prior to
      initiating treatment, and the appropriate dose of antihistamine to be given.

      Initial doses of the medication will be given intravenously (injected through a vein) and
      later doses will be administered orally (by mouth).

      By following the procedure, researchers will be able to determine if there is a more
      effective route of drug administration, as well as the effectiveness of antihistamines in
      patients treated surgically for Zollinger-Ellison pancreatic tumors with mildly elevated
      gastric acid levels.

      This protocol describes the use of histamine H2-receptor antagonists to control gastric acid
      hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It details which patients will be
      considered for treatment with these agents, the pretreatment procedures and the procedures to
      be followed in establishing the proper intravenous dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist.
      It also details the procedure to be used to establish a safe and effective oral long-term
      maintenance dose of either cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, or famotidine. By following
      these procedures it will be possible to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous histamine
      H2 therapy if it is determined this is important for antisecretory control during periods
      when patients cannot take oral gastric antisecretory agents. It will also be possible to
      evaluate the effectiveness of histamine H2-receptor in patients with Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome after successful gastrinoma resection who continue to have mild gastric
      hypersecretion.
