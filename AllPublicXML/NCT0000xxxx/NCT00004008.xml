      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who
      have ovarian epithelial cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the antitumor activity and toxicity of bryostatin 1 in patients with platinum
           resistant ovarian epithelial cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours. Treatment repeats weekly for 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable or
      regressive disease may receive additional treatment.

      Patients are followed for at least 4 weeks after treatment, then every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
