      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known if paclitaxel is more effective with or without gemcitabine for advanced breast
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel with or without
      gemcitabine in treating women who have advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare overall survival of patients with unresectable, locally recurrent, or
      metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Patients receive paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine. Treatment continues
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 2-4 months
      for 2 years after active treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified

      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not
      update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to
      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion
      date. This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act
      of 2007 (FDAAA).
