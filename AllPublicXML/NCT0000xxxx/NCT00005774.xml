  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is
      associated with lung injury and nosocomial infection. Moderately premature infants with mild
      respiratory distress do not routinely receive artificial surfactant early in their course of
      treatment. This multi-center, randomized trial tested whether early surfactant therapy and
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in infants 1,250-2,000g with RDS reduced
      mechanical ventilation usage without added complications. Infants with mild to moderate
      respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in the trial and given either early
      administration of surfactant followed by extubation within 30 minutes and the use of CPAP, or
      standard practice (surfactant according to current center practice, only after initiation of
      mechanical ventilation), to see whether the experimental method would reduce the need for
      subsequent mechanical ventilation.

    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is
      associated with lung injury and nosocomial infection. Moderately premature infants with mild
      respiratory distress do not routinely receive artificial surfactant early in their course of
      treatment. The role of surfactant therapy in the management of larger infants with
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was unclear. In many neonatal intensive care units, these
      infants were routinely managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone.

      This trial tested whether early use of surfactant combined with CPAP would ameliorate the
      course of RDS without an increased risk of death. Primary study outcomes were measures of use
      of mechanical ventilation, and thereby likely reduction in risk of ventilator-associated
      morbidity.

      Eligible infants were randomized before the infant is 12 hours of age to receive either:
      early surfactant followed by extubation within 30 minutes and application of CPAP
      (intervention group); or surfactant according to current center practice, only after
      initiation of mechanical ventilation (control group).

      The trial was stopped after 7 months for lack of recruitment.
