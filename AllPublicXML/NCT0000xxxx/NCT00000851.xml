  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and determine the pharmacokinetic disposition of stavudine (d4T) alone
      and in combination with didanosine (ddI), and whether concurrent administration alters the
      disposition of either drug. To compare d4T versus d4T plus ddI with respect to short and long
      term changes from baseline in plasma HIV RNA concentrations. To determine the relationship,
      if any, between drug exposure and viral burden.

      In a pilot study of d4T and ddI given to eight children with advanced HIV for 24 weeks, the
      three children with baseline counts greater than 50 cells/micro liter experienced a 20%
      increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Based on these results, controlled trials of the
      same regimen for children with less advanced HIV disease should be undertaken.

      increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Based on these results, controlled trials of the
      same regimen for children with less advanced HIV disease should be undertaken.

      Eligible subjects receiving d4T will be assigned in an open manner to Arm 1, and subjects who
      have been receiving zidovudine (AZT) will be assigned in a randomized, double blind manner to
      Arms 2 and 3. Each subject will receive study drug for 48 weeks as follows: Arm 1 - d4T plus
      ddI, Arm 2 - d4T alone, Arm 3 - d4T plus ddI.
