  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mood management intervention on abstinent
      alcoholic smokers with a history of major depression. The second aim is to determine the
      effect of smoking treatments on alcohol abstinence and to identify factors associated with
      smoking and alcohol outcomes (e.g., more days of abstinence). A randomized, two-group design
      will be used to evaluate the added benefit of mood management compared to a state-of-the-art
      smoking cessation treatment. Treatment will consist of 8 weekly group sessions and 1, 3, 6,
      and 12-month follow-up.
