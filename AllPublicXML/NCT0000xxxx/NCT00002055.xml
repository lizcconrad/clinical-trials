             Patients must be at least 2 weeks status post therapy for acute PCP.

          -  Adequate pulmonary function (vital capacity = or &gt; 65 percent of predicted; forced
             expiratory volume, 1 s = or &gt; 55 percent of total FEV; and corrected pulmonary
             diffusion capacity &gt; 50 percent of predicted).

          -  Patients must be free of acute medical problems.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Asthma poorly controlled by medication.

          -  Receiving active therapy for tuberculosis.

        Concurrent Medication:

          -  Active therapy for tuberculosis.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Requiring ongoing active therapy for an opportunistic infection at time of study
             entry.

          -  AIDS-defining opportunistic infection prior to study entry such as toxoplasmosis and

          -  Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Unwilling to sign informed consent.

          -  Asthma poorly controlled by medication.

          -  Unwilling to cooperate with study procedures.

          -  Receiving active therapy for tuberculosis.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 30 days of study entry:

          -  Antiretrovirals (other than zidovudine (AZT)).

          -  Immunomodulating agents.

          -  Corticosteroids.
