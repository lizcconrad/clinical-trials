        Concurrent Medication:

        Required:

          -  Anti-pneumocystis prophylactic therapy (dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitors with or

          -  No MAC positive blood cultures within 1 month prior to study entry.

          -  No symptoms suggestive of disseminated MAC infection (including unexplained diarrhea,
             fever, and night sweats) within 1 month of study entry.

        Co-existing Condition:

          -  Concomitant putative immunostimulants.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:
