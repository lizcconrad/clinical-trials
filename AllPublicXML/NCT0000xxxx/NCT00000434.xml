  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have found that exercise can reduce pain, improve endurance for physical
      activities, and improve cardiovascular fitness over time. However, these studies have not
      looked at the impact of exercise programs for older adults with osteoarthritis or at how long
      older adults continue exercising after a program is finished. This study will look at the
      long-term effects of a structured exercise program for people aged 60 or older who have
      osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. One goal of the exercise program is to encourage older
      people with osteoarthritis to continue exercising.

      We will randomly assign study participants to either the exercise program or a control group
      that does not do the exercise program. We will monitor participants at the start of the
      study, at 8 weeks, and every 3 months for 2 years after the program is completed. The
      exercise program lasts for 8 weeks and includes an exercise part and an educational part led
      by trained physical therapists. We believe that participants in the treatment (exercise)
      group will show higher rates of continued exercise and higher functional status over time
      compared to the group of people who do not participate in the exercise program.

    <textblock>
      Recent exercise interventions have demonstrated statistically significant short-term
      improvements in muscle strength, fitness, and physical activity in people under the age of
      70. This study seeks to determine if those same benefits can be achieved in an older
      population (mean age 84) with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The study will examine the
      long-term effects of a structured exercise program that seeks to promote adherence to
      continued exercise.

      We will randomly assign people who meet the study criteria to the exercise intervention or
      control group. We will conduct measures at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 3-month intervals for
      2 years following the intervention. The exercise component of the intervention will include
      lower extremity muscle strengthening, range-of-motion exercises, and fitness walking. An
      educational component will focus on arthritis self-efficacy and perceived self-reported
      exercise efficacy. We hypothesize that treatment group participants will exhibit higher rates
      of adherence to exercise and higher functional status outcomes over time compared to
      controls.
