      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify latent hypoparathyroidism in normocalcemic adult survivors with
      repaired conotruncal cardiac defects, by evaluating parathyroid gland secretory function
      after induced hypocalcemia.

      II. Determine the relationship of parathyroid hormone secretion to microdeletions in the same
      region of chromosome 22q11 as found in patients with DiGeorge anomaly.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are given sodium citrate over a 2 hour infusion on day 1. Blood is drawn at times
      -30, -15, 0, and every 10 minutes thereafter during the infusion. On day 2, patients are
      given calcium gluconate over a 2 hour infusion. Blood is drawn at times -30, -15, 0, and
      every 10 minutes thereafter during the infusion.
