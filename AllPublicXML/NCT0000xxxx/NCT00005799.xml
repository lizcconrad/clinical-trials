      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total body irradiation, and donor
      stem cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic malignancies or kidney cancer.
      Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a
      donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may
      also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem
      cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      cyclosporine before the transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the
      transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic engraftment from unrelated hematopoietic stem cell
      donors can be safely established using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients
      with hematologic malignancies and renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be safely used in patients with
      mixed or full donor chimerism to eliminate persistent or progressive disease.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2. Patients also undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      100 with taper to day 177 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-40 with taper to day 96.
      Patients with mixed chimerism, persistent or progressive disease, and no evidence of
      graft-versus-host disease and who have been off immunosuppression for at least 2 weeks
      undergo DLI over 30 minutes. DLI may be repeated every 65 days for up to 3 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow-up periodically for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 50 years with hematologic malignancies treatable by allogeneic hematopoietic
             stem cell transplant (HSCT) and all patients with B cell malignancies except those who
             may be cured by autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT)

          -  Age =&lt; 50 years of age with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HSCT who
             through pre-existing medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be of high
             risk for regimen related toxicity associated with a conventional transplant or those
             patients who refuse a conventional SCT; transplants must be approved for these
             inclusion criteria by both the participating institution's patient review committee
             such as the Patient Care Conference (PCC at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

          -  Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with the histologic subtypes of clear
             cell, papillary and medullary may be accepted regardless of age

          -  The following diseases will be permitted although other diagnoses can be considered if

                  donor is available; patients with persistent or refractory disease will be
                  considered on a case by case basis and transplants must be approved by the
                  institution's patient review committees

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) - patients will be accepted in chronic phase

               -  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) - all patients with MDS will be eligible for this
                  protocol; however, those patients with MDS and frank AML (&gt; 30% blasts in bone
                  marrow aspirate by morphology or flow cytometry) will require induction
                  chemotherapy to obtain a complete remission (marrow blasts &lt; 5%) and remain in
                  complete remission at time of transplant

               -  Renal cell carcinoma- must have evidence of disease not amenable to surgical cure
