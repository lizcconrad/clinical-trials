  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 6 month, placebo-controlled study of transdermal testosterone for women with
      HIV-associated weight loss. Women with AIDS wasting have been found to have low testosterone
      levels. This study is designed to test the efficacy of physiologic testosterone dosing to
      improve weight, muscle mass and quality of life indices, including energy level, appetite and
      libido, in androgen deficient women with AIDS wasting. After 6 months, all women receive open
      label transdermal testosterone for an additional 6 months.
