      BACKGROUND:

      Congenital cardiovascular malformations are a major cause of infant mortality in the United
      States. In 1985, six defects -- hypoplastic left heart, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus
      arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, endocardial cushion defect, and ventricular
      septal defect -- were among the fifteen most frequent causes of premature death due to
      congenital malformations, accounting for 109,063 years of life lost. This loss of productive
      life continues in spite of major advances in medical and surgical treatment of congenital
      cardiovascular malformations. Even as successful treatment modalities are developed, the
      survival to reproductive years without improved understanding of genetic risks produces
      additional unanswered questions.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Clinical assessment of cases and controls included medical history, pedigree construction,
      complete evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist, and two-dimensional and Doppler
      echocardiography. First degree relatives of cases and controls underwent
      clinical-echocardiographic evaluation also. The distribution of cardiac defects for all
      pedigrees within and among the proband group was delineated. The frequencies of heart defects
      were compared within and among pedigrees of cases and controls. Regressive logistic models of
      genetic determinants for the malformations were tested. The three participating clinical
      centers included University of Maryland at Baltimore, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the
      University of Rochester in Rochester, New York.
