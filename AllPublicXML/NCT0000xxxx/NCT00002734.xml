      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, paclitaxel, and
      interferon alfa in treating patients who have ovarian cancer. Radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to
      them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon may interfere with the
      growth of cancer cells. Combining monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, and interferon alfa may
      kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal paclitaxel and topotecan
      when administered as a radiosensitizer prior to intraperitoneal lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal
      antibody CC49 (177Lu-CC49) following subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b (IFN-A) in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity associated with intraperitoneal paclitaxel and topotecan in these
      patients.

      III. Examine the conjugate stability, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution of 177Lu-CC49
      given 48 hours after intraperitoneal paclitaxel.

      IV. Determine the effects of IFN-A and intraperitoneal paclitaxel on 177Lu-CC49 tumor
      localization and dosimetry estimates compared to a prior trial with 177Lu-CC49 alone.

      V. Determine the MTD of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody CC49 (90Y-CC49) when administered
      with IFN-A and the dose of paclitaxel used at the MTD level of IFN-A, paclitaxel, and
      177Lu-CC49.

      VI. Monitor any antitumor effects of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel, topotecan, lutetium LU 177 monoclonal
      antibody CC-49 (177Lu-CC49), and yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody CC49 (90Y-CC49).

      Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, and 7; paclitaxel
      intraperitoneally (IP) on day 4 or topotecan IP on day 6; and 177Lu-CC49 IP on day 6.
      Treatment continues every 6 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and
      decreasing doses of 177Lu-CC49 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 5 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Once the MTD of paclitaxel is determined, the dose of 177Lu-CC49 is escalated. Once
      the MTD of 177Lu-CC49 is determined, 90Y-CC49 is substituted. The MTD of 90Y-CC49 is then
      determined when administered with paclitaxel. Topotecan is then substituted for paclitaxel
      (administered with the MTD of 177Lu-CC49 and interferon alfa only) and escalated until the
      MTD is determined. Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.
