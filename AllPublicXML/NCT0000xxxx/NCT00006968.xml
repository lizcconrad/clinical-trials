      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with donor peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pentostatin followed by peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the duration and efficiency of hematopoietic and immunologic engraftment in
           patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with pentostatin followed by related
           allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the hematologic and non-hematologic toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pentostatin.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days -7, -5, and -3 followed by allogeneic
           stem cell transplantation on day 0. Beginning on day 1, patients receive filgrastim
           (G-CSF) IV over 1 hour or subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover. As
           graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously
           until stem cell engraftment and then orally with gradual tapering.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of pentostatin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD for pentostatin. Patients
           are followed weekly for 60 days and then monthly for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per phase) will be accrued for this study.
