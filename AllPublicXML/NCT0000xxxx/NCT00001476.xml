      This protocol will follow patients who participated in NIAID's study Gene Therapy Approach
      for Chronic Granulomatous Diseases (95-I-0134). No further gene therapy treatments will be
      given under this protocol. However, because gene therapy is a new technology and involves a
      permanent change in the genetic code of some cells, patients who have had this treatment
      require long-term health monitoring.

      Participants will be asked to provide updated address and telephone information and the names
      of two contact persons, such as siblings or friends. Patients will be seen about once a year
      at the NIH Clinical Center to provide an update on their health status and donate a small
      blood sample (about 2 teaspoons), which will be frozen and stored. If a patient acquires a
      serious illness, such as cancer, his or her stored blood will be tested; another of blood or
      tissue sample may also be requested for further study. If a patient develops a medical
      problem that is thought possibly to be related to gene therapy, the illness will be
      investigated. The annual follow-up visits will continue indefinitely or until the patient
      declines to continue participation.

      Participants may also agree to store some of their blood future research on chronic
      granulomatous diseases and other medical conditions. Stored samples may be labeled with a
      code, such as a number, that only the study team can link with the patient. Any identifying
      information about the patient will be kept confidential as is permitted by law.

      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of a method of ex
      vivo gene therapy to treat both X-linked gp91phox deficient Chronic Granulomatous Disease
      (CGD) and autosomal recessive p47phox deficient CGD. CGD is an inherited immune deficiency in
      which blood neutrophils and monocytes fail to produce superoxide and other antimicrobial
      oxidants, and patients get recurrent life-threatening infections. 30 CGD patients of either
      sex at least 5 years of age may be enrolled in addition to the 5 patients enrolled in the
      first phase of this trial. Patients less than 16 years of age must have an active infection
      or a recent relapse of infection at the time of enrollment. Patients may receive up to 6
      cycles of stem cell mobilization for gene therapy at intervals of 4 weeks or longer. For up
      to first 3 cycles, a cycle of stem cell mobilization for gene therapy will begin with 8 daily
      subcutaneous injections of the combination of flt3-ligand (flt3L) at 50 micro g/kg/day plus
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at 5 micro g/kg/day for
      mobilization of CD34+ cells. For 3 or more of the cycles of mobilization of CD34+ cells for
      gene therapy (up to the maximum of 6 cycles total), the mobilization will begin with 6 daily
      injections of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 10 micro g/kg/day. On the last
      two or three days of marrow growth factor administration for mobilization of CD34+ cells, the
      patients will have an apheresis procedure to harvest blood mononuclear cells, thus completing
      a cycle of mobilization and stem cell harvest. CD34+ progenitors will be selected from the
      apheresis collection using the Isolex(Registered Trademark) 300i anti-CD34 monoclonal
      antibody/magnetic bead selection system. The purified CD34+ cells may either be placed
      directly into culture or may be cryopreserved as per standard blood bank procedure (freezing
      in autologous serum with 10% dimethylsufoxide {DMSO}) and stored frozen at liquid nitrogen
      temperature until thawed for ex vivo culture and transduction. For a specific gene therapy
      treatment of intravenously infused, gene corrected stem cells, the purified CD34+ stem cells
      collected, purified and frozen from one or more cycles of mobilization will be thawed and
      then pooled at the time of placement into culture for transduction with the virus vector.
      CD34+ cells will be cultured in PL2417 gas permeable plastic containers that have been
      pre-coated with fibronectin fragment CH-296. The growth medium will be serum-free X-VIVO
      10(Registered Trademark) supplemented with 1% human serum albumin, 100 ng/ml flt3-ligand, 50
      ng/ml PIXY321 and 50 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF). Cultured CD34+ progenitors will be
      transduced on each of 3 or 4 days with either MFGS-p47phox or MFGS-gp91phox retrovirus
      vectors. The retrovirus vectors are replication defective packaged in amphotropic envelope
      lines engineered with the CRIP packaging elements (5' LTR-gag-pol-3'SV40polyA;
      5'LTR-AMenv-3'SV40polyA). MFGS-p47phox is packaged in the murine psi-crip line, while
      MFGS-gp91phox is packaged in the human 293-SPA line. The clinical retrovirus vector supernate
      will be animal protein-free and serum free. Safety testing for endotoxin, sterility, and
      absence of replication competent retrovirus will be performed on the retrovirus producer
      lines, virus particle lots, and transduced cells. Transduced CD34+ cells will be infused into
      the CGD patient. Thus, there will be a total of up to six cycles of stem cell mobilization,
      but because the CD34+ cells from one or more cycles of mobilization may be cryopreserved and
      then later pooled for culture to produce a single gene corrected stem cell product for
      infusion, there may be fewer than six rounds (and possibly only one round) of gene therapy
      treatments for a patient who participates in this study. Blood will be tested periodically
      for the appearance and persistence of neutrophils that are functionally corrected by the gene
      therapy. The efficacy goal for this study is to allow CGD patients to produce autologous
      gene-corrected functionally normal NADPH oxidase positive neutrophils to a level of at least
      1 in 1000 circulating neutrophils for at least four weeks. This may provide clinical benefit
      in the form of increased host defense against an ongoing or potential infection. The clinical
      status of patients will be monitored for any evidence of toxicity. Information obtained from
      this study will provide information important for achieving the ultimate goal of the
      development of gene therapy for CGD that will be a permanent cure for this disorder.

        antibiotics).

        Confirmed diagnosis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease as defined by less than 2 percent of
        normal oxidant production by all circulating neutrophils.

        Confirmed CGD genetic subtype of gp91(phox)-deficiency or p47(phox)-deficiency as defined
        by the absence or deficiency of the phox subunit protein using an antibody detection assay
        (western blot, ELISA, or flow cytometry) of patient granulocytes.

        Subjects without current active infection or recent multiple recurrence of infections must
        have adequate organ function as defined by renal function (creatinine less than or equal to
        2 mg per dl; less than or equal to 2+ proteinuria); hepatic function (bilirubin less than
        or equal to 1.5 mg per dl; prothrombin time less than or equal to 1.3 x control);

        If a female of childbearing potential, then the patient must have a negative serum
        pregnancy test within one week of beginning administration of combination flt3L and GM-CSF
        or single agent G-CSF. Both male and female must use a barrier or other effective form of
        contraception during marrow growth factor administration and for at least three months
        following the last reinfusion of the transduced CD34 + PBHP.

        Written informed consent, conforming to institutional guidelines obtained from patient

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Female patients who are pregnant or lactating as determined by history and/or positive
        pregnancy test.

        While patients may have an active infection under treatment and still be included in the
        study, patients are excluded who are in shock, manifested by severe hypotension (less than
        100 systolic or less than 60 diastolic) or severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation
        and piO(2) greater than 40 percent.

        HIV antibody/antigen positive or hepatitis B, C antigen positive. (Exceptions to this
        exclusion may be made on a case by case basis in consultation with the Transfusion Medicine
        staff where severe bacterial or fungal infection is present).

        Any condition which in the opinion of the attending physician or the Apheresis Unit staff

        (hematocrit/hemoglobin below less than 26/8), in adequate venous access, and/or severe
        coagulation disorder. Patients with severe infection who have a hematocrit/hemoglobin below
        less than 26/8 and might benefit clinically from participation in this protocol may undergo
        apheresis at the discretion of the physician in charge of the Apheresis Unit. In that
        setting RBC transfusion may be used to raise the hematocrit/hemoglobin to a level safe for
        apheresis.

        Any condition which in the opinion of the principal investigator or the patient's primary
        physician contraindicates administration of bone marrow growth factors at the indicated
        doses, such as preexisting severe autoimmune vasculitis or other severe autoimmune
        inflammatory conditions where augmentation of immune responses or infiltration of
        granulocytes may exacerbate the condition.
