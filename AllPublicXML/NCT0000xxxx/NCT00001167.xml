      This study will assess the use of ultrasound-a test that uses sound waves to produce
      images-as a diagnostic tool for evaluating speech and swallowing.

      The following categories of individuals may be eligible for this study: 1) healthy volunteers
      between 20 and 85 years old with normal speech and hearing, 2) patients 6 to 85 years old
      with developmental neurological deficits in speech or swallowing, and 3) patients with tumors
      of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx being treated at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center.

      Participants will undergo a 30-minute speech and oral motion evaluation, in which they
      imitate sounds, words and oral movements while a speech pathologist evaluates their lip,
      tongue and palate movements. They may also be asked to drink a small amount of water for
      examination of swallowing function.

      For the ultrasound examination, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for transmitting and receiving
      sound waves) is placed under the participant's chin. While the transducer is in place, the
      subject 1) repeats sounds and a series of syllables in several sequences, 2) swallows three
      times with and without a small amount of water, and 3) swallows 3 teaspoons of non-fat
      pudding. The ultrasound images are recorded on tape for later analysis.

      Studies conducted using ultrasound imaging at the NIH, Departments of Rehabilitation Medicine
      and Diagnostic Radiology, have demonstrated that ultrasound imaging can be used reliably to
      study speech and swallowing impairments in a variety of conditions and diseases. Since
      ultrasound is non-invasive with no reported bioeffects, it can be used repeatedly to follow
      the progression of a disease. Ultrasound imaging of the oral cavity during speech and
      swallowing allows easy visualization of the tongue/hyoid bone motion and transport of the
      bolus during swallowing and tongue surface configuration during speech. Images can be
      obtained in several planes for viewing muscular coordination and timing and specific measures
      can be obtained from digitized video images. Thus it has widespread clinical research
      implications for patients with disorders affecting the oral peripheral muscles, salivary
      gland flow and the central nervous system control of speech and swallowing. While ultrasound
      technology has been used extensively in Europe to evaluate tumors of the head and neck, its
      use in this country has been marginal. We plan to compare ultrasound evaluation of tumor
      staging, tumor volume, and tumor recurrence in patients with tumors of the larynx, oral
      cavity and hypopharynx. Currently, this is accomplished by CT or MRI scanning procedures. We
      plan to compare CT/MRI results with ultrasound to determine if this non-invasive technique
      can be utilized reliably for diagnosis and tracking of oropharyngeal tumors.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Normal volunteers:

        Normal volunteers ages 21 to 85 may be asked to participate in a study of speech and
        swallowing utilizing a traditional clinical examination of oral-motor performance. If the
        subjects are without deficits in dental occlusion, speech articulation, tongue and lip
        strength, tongue and lip mobility, palatal function and oral sensation they will be asked
        to participate in an ultrasonic evaluation of tongue/hyoid interaction during swallowing
        and speech.

        Children will be included if they are referred with a medical condition that affects the
        oral pharyngeal phase of swallowing, voice production or laryngeal function and the
        investigator needs to evaluate functional performance and safety for oral feeding.

        Neurological Group:

        Subjects aged 6 to 85 with diagnosed developmental, neuromotor, systemic, genetic,
        neurologic, structural and post surgical dysfunction who have deficits in speech
        (dysarthria) and/or swallow (dysphagia) may be asked to participate in this study of
        ultrasonic imaging. Aging patients with and without dementia may also be studied. Patients
        with Post Polio Syndrome, Polymyositis, Dermatomyositis, Toricollis, Cerebellar
        Degeneration, Parkinson's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, ALS, Cystinosis, are
        among the conditions of interest. Subjects with complaints of oral dryness, and patients
        who have undergone mandibular and oral surgery may also be studied during swallowing.

        Oropharyngeal/Laryngeal Tumors:

        Patients will be seen who are enrolled in NCI and NIDCD protocols for head and neck tumors.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Normal Subjects:

        Hearing impairment reported (above 40 db, bilaterally)

        Dentures

        Oral Prosthesis

        Palatal surgery or other restorative dental surgery

        Radial neck dissection, glossectomy

        Tumor or masses in neck or tongue

        Cerebral vascular attack

        Stuttering

        Non-English speaker

        Childhood articulation impairment
