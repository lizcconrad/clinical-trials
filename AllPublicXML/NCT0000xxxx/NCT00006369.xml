      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      ERA-923 may fight breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ERA-923 in treating
      postmenopausal women who have metastatic breast cancer that no longer responds to tamoxifen.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of 2 dose levels of ERA-923 in postmenopausal patients
      with metastatic breast cancer refractory to tamoxifen. II. Determine the safety and plasma
      levels of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the impact on quality of life of these
      patients by this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms receiving different doses of ERA-923. Patients receive oral ERA-923
      daily for 48 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of
      life is assessed at baseline; at weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48; and then at 4 weeks
      after last dose. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At total of 36-100 patients (18-50 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 1 year.
