      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal cisplatin in treating
      patients who have recurrent ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent platinum
      sensitive ovarian epithelial cancer treated with cisplatin liposomal (SPI-77). II. Determine
      the time to response, duration of response, time to progression, and survival in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Characterize the safety of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin liposomal (SPI-77) IV over a minimum of 4 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical benefit after 6 courses may receive additional
      courses upon approval by the pharmaceutical sponsor. Patients are followed every 2 months for
      a minimum of 6 months and then periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-63 patients will be accrued for this study.
