      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system to try to
      stop cancer cells from growing. Combining interferon alfa and interleukin-2 may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa and interleukin-2 in
      treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the response and disease-free survival of patients with metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma treated with subcutaneous interleukin-2 and interferon alfa.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo nephrectomy if the diseased kidney makes up the bulk of the tumor
      burden.

      All patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa on day 1 and interleukin-2 on days 3-5 of
      week 1, followed by reduced doses of interferon alfa and interleukin-2 on days 1, 3, and 5 of
      weeks 2-6. Patients are assessed for response approximately 2 months after initiating
      therapy. Patients with stable or responding disease undergo a second course; those who
      continue to respond may receive additional therapy provided toxicity is limited.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 patients will be entered.
