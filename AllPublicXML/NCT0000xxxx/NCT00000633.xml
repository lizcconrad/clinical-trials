  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope
      glycoprotein (gp160) in asymptomatic HIV-infected adult volunteers. To compare safety and
      immunogenicity of two different schedules of gp160 administration. To examine the effects of
      gp160 and hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) on various markers of viral load and on selected
      immune parameters.

      Potentiation of a patient's immune response to HIV might possibly prolong the period of
      clinical latency and protect the patient indefinitely. Preliminary results from a study of
      Immuno-AG recombinant gp160 vaccine in healthy volunteers not infected with HIV suggest that
      the vaccine is safe and produces antibodies against the virus. Because another previous study
      failed to demonstrate a specific anti-HIV response in patients injected with a recombinant
      vaccinia virus containing HIV-1 genes, this study is also testing the immunotherapeutic role
      of other immunizations (such as hepatitis B vaccination) that would be expected to induce a
      nonspecific immune response in HIV-infected persons.

      Potentiation of a patient's immune response to HIV might possibly prolong the period of

      of other immunizations (such as hepatitis B vaccination) that would be expected to induce a
      nonspecific immune response in HIV-infected persons.

      Fifty-five healthy HIV-positive volunteers are randomly assigned to one of the following
      treatment arms: six injections (arm I) or four injections (arm II) of HIV-1 gp160 vaccine,
      four injections of hepatitis B vaccine as a non-HIV viral vaccine control (arm III), or six
      placebo injections consisting of the adjuvant vehicle used for the gp160 vaccine (arm IV).
      Immunizations or placebo are given at 4-week intervals for 5 months. To maintain blinding,
      adjuvant vehicle placebo is administered on days 84 and 112 to those volunteers receiving
      four instead of six vaccine injections (arms II and III). Volunteers are followed at 4-month
      intervals for 2 years.

          -  Mean CD4 cell count = or &gt; 600 cells/mm3 for all visits (minimum 2 counts) within 60
             days prior to study entry, with no single count &lt; 450 cells/mm3.

          -  Negative PPD test or normal chest x-ray with positive PPD (induration = or &gt; 5 mm).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positive.

          -  Evidence of an AIDS- or ARC-defining opportunistic infection.

          -  Evidence of disseminated tuberculosis, severe or persistent candidiasis, oral hairy
             leukoplakia, prolonged or very severe diarrhea, herpes zoster, or herpes simplex
             persisting more than one month.

          -  Active syphilis.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Evidence of psychiatric disorder within the past year that would impair adherence to
             the protocol.

          -  History of an AIDS- or ARC-defining opportunistic infection.

          -  History of disseminated tuberculosis, severe or persistent candidiasis, oral hairy
             leukoplakia, prolonged or very severe diarrhea, herpes zoster, or herpes simplex
             persisting more than one month.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Immunomodulating agents (e.g., isoprinosine, imuthiol, lithium) within 90 days of
             screening.

          -  Immunosuppressive medications within the previous 3 months.
