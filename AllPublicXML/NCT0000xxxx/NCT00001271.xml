        Presence of objectively measurable sites of disease. Bone marrow positivity and circulating
        tumor cells in the peripheral blood will be considered evaluable but not measurable
        disease.

        No patients with purely B-cell Lymphosarcoma cell leukemia without nodal or soft tissue
        involvement.

        No patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or B-cell or pre-B-cell acute
        lymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia.

        Patients with objectively measurable disease outside a radiation port or disease which has
        clearly progressed within a radiation port.

        HIV negative.

        No CNS disease.

        No pulmonary parenchymal disease.

        Pleural effusions or ascites may be present.

        Patients with progression of disease despite at least one standard combination chemotherapy
        regimen.

        No chemotherapy for at least two weeks prior to entry.

        Patients who do not desire or are not candidates for autologous or allogeneic bone marrow
        transplantation procedures.

        Life expectancy of at least 3 months

        Creatinine clearance greater than 60 cc per minute.

        Total bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl.

        SGPT less than 2 times the upper limit of normal.

        Albumin greater than 75 percent of the lower limit of normal.

        If prior treatment with doxorubicin, the radionuclide or echocardiogram ejection fraction
        shall be at least 35 percent.

        Performance status 0-2.

        Not in need of current radiation therapy to alleviate local problems.

        No prior exposure to murine antibodies.

        No need for current corticosteroid treatment.
