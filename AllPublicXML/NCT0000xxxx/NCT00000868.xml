  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of giving healthy
      volunteers a new oral HIV vaccine which has been incorporated into a bacterial cell. This
      oral vaccine (HIV-1 LAI gp120) will be given with or without a different injected HIV vaccine
      (HIV-1 MN rgp120).

      Vaccines are preparations that are introduced into the body to try to prevent infection or
      create resistance to infection. This study examines a new oral vaccine to see if it can
      improve the immune system's ability to fight the HIV virus when given alone or with another
      injected vaccine.

      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy for AIDS, there is no cure for
      HIV-1 infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most affected populations. The
      development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection and AIDS worldwide is a
      global priority. One promising approach in the development of HIV-1 vaccines utilizes live
      vaccines as vectors to express HIV-1 antigens. The potential advantages of the live vector
      approach include the ability of live vector recombinants to induce long-lasting humoral and
      cell-mediated immunity (particularly neutralizing antibody and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell
      activity) and the relatively low cost of production. Moreover, live vector recombinant
      vaccines administered orally might be able to stimulate the production of secretory IgA
      vaccine-specific antibodies locally at relevant mucosal sites.

      Part I of this study is conducted as an open-label, dose-escalation trial. The first 5
      volunteers (Group A) receive a single oral dose of Salmonella typhi CVD 908-HIV-1 LAI gp 120
      (VVG203). If no typhoid fever-like illness is seen in these volunteers during at least 14
      days of follow-up, the next 5 patients (Group B) receive a single dose of VVG203. If this
      higher dose is well-tolerated, Phase II of the study is initiated once all Phase I volunteers
      have been assessed for safety for at least 21 days. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: Groups A and
      B are expanded to 10 patients each.] Part II of this study is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Nine volunteers are randomized to each of treatment
      groups, with oral VVG203 given alone or sequentially with HIV-1 SF-2 rgp 120 in MF59 (SF)
      given intramuscularly. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: Randomization is to VVG 203 alone or
      sequentially with HIV-1 MN rgp120 in alum (MN).] A total of 3 vaccinations are administered
      within each 9-person cohort, 1 volunteer serves as a control and receives a sodium
      bicarbonate buffer rather than VVG203 or a vaccine placebo rather than SF. Group C receives
      VVG at Month 0 and SF at Months 2 and 6. Group D receives VVG at Months 0, 2, and 6. Group E
      receives SF at Months 0 and 2 and VVG at Month 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97: MN is given in
      place of SF in all Groups C, D, and E.]
