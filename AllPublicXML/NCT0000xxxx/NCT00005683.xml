  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct clinical interventions directed at neonatal lung disease and injury, with a focus
      on infants having surfactant-deficiency or inactivation as a component of pathophysiology. A
      major emphasis was on the surfactant-deficient Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) of
      premature infants, and on acute neonatal respiratory failure in term infants with pulmonary
      edema and potential surfactant inactivation (ARDS-related).

      BACKGROUND:

      The study was a subproject within a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) in Lung Biology and
      Diseases in Infants and Children. The clinical interventions studied had significance for
      respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn and for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is the
      chronic lung disorder of fibrosis, alveolar loss and reactive airway disease that often
      follows pulmonary disease requiring treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation in the
      newborn period.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A series of randomized, controlled trials/studies were conducted. In the first clinical
      study, full term infants with severe respiratory pathology where surfactant inactivation was
      important were assigned randomly to exogenous surfactant versus control groups to determine
      if surfactant was efficacious and safe in this kind of lung injury. In the second study,
      infants of less than 29 weeks gestation received prophylactic exogenous surfactant, but were
      assigned randomly to receive it immediately following birth or after initial stabilization at
      10-15 minutes, to address a then critical current issue in surfactant therapy for RDS. In the
      third study, infants who had moderate RDS despite exogenous surfactant therapy were randomly
      assigned to high frequency jet or conventional ventilation groups to determine if this mode
      of ventilation therapy would reduce barotrauma and the incidence and/or severity of
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to these three clinical trials, another study
      involved therapy using superoxide dismutase (SOD) along with surfactant as a multi-modal
      approach treating premature infants with RDS and lung injury secondary to hyperoxia and
      mechanical ventilation. This study depended on results of animal studies with SOD in Project
      5. Finally, the study addressed the long term evaluation and surveillance of survival,
      rehospitalizations, health status, pulmonary sequelae, and school performance of those
      infants enrolled in the randomized clinical trials, as necessary for long-term outcome
      assessments.
