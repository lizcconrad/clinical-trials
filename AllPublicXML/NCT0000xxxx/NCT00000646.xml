  <brief_summary>

      To determine whether pentoxifylline lowers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in AIDS
      patients. Pentoxifylline decreases tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and therefore should decrease
      such TNF-intensified events as cachexia, enhanced HIV expression, and inhibition of
      zidovudine (AZT) activity.

      Pentoxifylline decreases tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and therefore should decrease such
      TNF-intensified events as cachexia, enhanced HIV expression, and inhibition of zidovudine
      (AZT) activity.

      Twenty-seven AIDS patients with elevated TNF and less than 300 CD4 cells are given
      pentoxifylline 3 times a day for 8 weeks. If no significant changes are seen in virologic,
      immunologic, or related measures, 27 additional patients are given a higher dose of
      pentoxifylline 3 times a day for eight weeks.
