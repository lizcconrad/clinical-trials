  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two parts. The first part of the study will use MRI technology to
      view the brain structure of patients with neurological disorders and normal volunteers. This
      portion of the study will attempt to detect specific areas of damage in the brains of
      patients with amnesia and dementia. It will also try to correlate the amount of brain damage
      with performance on tests used to measure memory.

      In the second part of the study, researchers plan to use MRI technology to study brain
      function of patients with neurological disorders and normal volunteers when they perform
      tasks. MRI signals during task performance will be used to record areas of the brain
      receiving more blood flow indicating increased activity.

      Researchers believe this study will help improve existing methods of evaluating patients with
      neurological disorders. In addition, this study may contribute information about areas of the
      brain involved in thought processing and motor and sensory function.

      We wish to use MRI technology to study brain structure (Part 1) and function (Part 2) in
      several neurological disorders and in normal controls. In Part 1 of this protocol, we
      describe our interest in using detailed MRI brain structure analysis to identify predicted
      specific neural structure atrophy in patients with selective amnesia and dementia and to
      attempt to associate the magnitude of atrophy in these neural structures with performance on
      selected memory tests. In Part 2 of this protocol, we outline our interest in utilizing newly
      developed MRI techniques to identify selective changes in local brain blood volume, blood
      flow, and other physiological parameters during functional stimulation. Recent developments
      permit recording of MRI signals that are indicative of regional cerebral blood volume and
      blood flow changes. Local changes in these physiological measures appear to topographically
      overlap with expected areas of functional brain activation. The advantage of this method over
      Positron Emission Tomography is the exquisite spatial resolution of MRI. This MRI technique
      is new and has had only limited use so far. The studies in Part 2 of this protocol should
      help develop the method and begin to answer fundamental biological and functional questions
      about the representation and activation of cognitive, motor, and sensory functions.
