      This study is designed to evaluate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a
      potential treatment for depression. In rTMS, a rapidly changing magnetic field passes through
      your scalp and skull and generates a small electrical pulses in your brain. rTMS at lower
      intensities has helped some people with depression but we do not know what the results will
      be in your case using higher intensities, or whether you will be randomized to 3 weeks of
      high frequency (20 cycles er second), low frequency (1 cycle per second), or inactive
      (sham)rTMS. You will be assigned to receive one of these types of rTMS over the left front
      art of your brain five times per week for the three weeks. Each rTMS treatment session should
      take between 20-30 minutes of actual stimulation, but weekly ratings, memory testing, and
      blood sampling may require several hours per week. We will also ask you to have brain imaging
      procedures to see if these will predict response to high vs. low frequency rTMS. If you are
      randomized to the 3 weeks of sham rTMS, you will have the opportunity to receive one of the
      active stimulation frequencies for an additional 3 weeks. Responders to any phase will be
      offered an additional month of rTMS prior to study termination and recommendations of
      alternative treatments.

    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new technique for activating the
      brain noninvasively through the scalp and skull. It has proven effective in producing
      localized effects on brain function and has opened many areas of human brain function to
      direct investigation. Preliminary data also suggest potential therapeutic applications in
      neuropsychiatric illness. We plan to further investigate the possible therapeutic use of rTMS
      in depression under conditions of high frequency (20 Hz), low (1Hz) frequency, and sham and
      to also examine possible cognitive or endocrine effects. Among the priorities of this
      protocol will be to further evaluate the risks of the technique.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        All patients will receive a psychiatric and physical examination by a qualified physician.

        Patients will be from 18 to 90 years of age and must give informed consent.

        Unipolar patients must be medication free to participate. Patients with bipolar disorder
        depression may be medication-free or on any combination (including monotherapy) of lithium,
        carbamazepine, and valproate. Inpatient monitoring will be provided when medically
        indicated.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Reasons for exclusion will be the presence of cardiac pacemakers, medication pumps,
        cochlear implants or metal objects in the head or eyes that could be dangerous if heated or
        moved by the magnetic pulses.

        General contraindications to rTMS or a current diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse.

        Subjects having serious medical illnesses or meeting current psychoactive substance
        dependence will be excluded from entry.
