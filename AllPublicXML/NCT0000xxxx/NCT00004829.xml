      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of tobramycin in patients with cystic
      fibrosis who are chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      II. Determine whether this treatment produces tobramycin-resistant bacteria at a frequency
      different from the placebo group and whether the emergence of resistance is associated with a
      lack of clinical response.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

      Patients receive tobramycin or placebo by inhalation twice daily for 28 days followed by 28
      days of rest. This treatment is repeated twice, for a total of 3 courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks, and then at 4
      weeks after the last treatment.
