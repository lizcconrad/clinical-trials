  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Often women are prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during the perimenopause or
      menopause.

      Hormone replacement therapy includes both estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen component
      of HRT helps to relieve the symptoms and has a beneficial effect on the heart and bones, but
      estrogen also increases the risk of uterine cancer. The progesterone component of the HRT
      (progestin) works to prevent the increased risk of uterine cancer.

      There is evidence that some women experience unpleasant mood symptoms (such as irritability,
      depressed mood and anxiety) while receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) while taking
      the progestin / progesterone component of the HRT.

      This study is designed to evaluate the ability of progestins to produce negative mood
      symptoms in women. Researchers intend on doing this by comparing the effects of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) and a placebo inactive sugar pill. Patient's moods will
      be monitered based on their response to questionnaires answered in the outpatient clinic and
      at home.

      This research will attempt to answer the following questions:

        1. Are progestins associated with changes in mood during hormone replacement therapy?

        2. If progestins are associated with mood disturbance, is it because they are blocking the
           beneficial effects of estrogen?

      There is evidence in the literature that some women experience dysphoric symptoms while
      receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and that this disturbance in mood is related to
      the progestin component of the HRT. The bulk of this evidence is anecdotal. While some
      authors have attempted to examine this putative problem in a more systematic fashion, there
      are no controlled studies that attempt to identify the mechanism through which the
      perturbation in mood occurs. Adverse effects of progestins might be mediated directly through
      the progesterone or androgen receptor. Alternatively, the effects of progestins might be
      consequent to the antiestrogen effects of progesterone. This latter possibility is in part
      supported by our observation in previous studies of the beneficial effects of estradiol on
      mood and the possible precipitation of mood disturbance following acute estrogen withdrawal.
      Finally, despite the popular lore that progesterone causes mood disturbances, a placebo
      effect cannot be ruled out, since women taking HRT know when they are receiving the progestin
      component of the regimen. Our research questions therefore are as follows: 1) Are progestins
      associated with changes in mood during HRT, and 2) If progestins are associated with mood
      disturbance, is it because they are blocking the beneficial effects of estrogen?

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The subjects in this study will be women who meet the following criteria:

          1. history of mood and/or behavioral symptoms associated with hormone replacement
             therapy;

          2. age 40 to 65;

          3. in good medical health.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Any subject with significant physical, EKG, mammogram or laboratory abnormalities will not
        participate in this protocol. Additionally prior to participation all subjects will be
        examined for any contradictions to estrogen therapy (as determined by a pelvic exam and
        mammogram) within the past year by a gynecologist of their choice. In those patients who
        are unable to independently arrange this exam, we have arranged for a consultant
        gynecologist to be available through our collaboration with NICHD.
