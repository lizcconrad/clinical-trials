  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and immune response to two experimental vaccines when formulated with
      QS-21 or QS-21 plus alum. To determine whether the new preparation of QS-21 in polysorbate 80
      is less reactogenic than the QS-21 formulation used in AVEG Protocols 016, 016A, and 016B. To
      examine whether QS-21 is immunologically equivalent to that used in 16B. To determine if
      QS-21, when given with low doses of antigen, induces measurable HIV-1-specific CTL activity.
      To evaluate if the QS-21 dose-sparing effect extends to an antigen dose of 0.5 micrograms. To
      determine if the bivalent vaccine gives responses equivalent to the monovalent product or if
      a broadening of the HIV-1-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses occurs.

      An effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection may need to generate diverse and multifaceted
      immunologic responses. Required parts of the immune response may include: humoral antibodies,
      which broadly neutralize non-syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1; T cell help provided by
      both CD4 and CD8 positive subsets; and a class I-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte response.
      Other effector responses, such as the generation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,
      cytokines, chemokines, or other antiviral factors may also be critical in mounting protective
      immunity. Given the lack of a surrogate immunologic marker, the most practical approach for
      possible efficacy trials would be to evaluate a candidate vaccine that elicits as many of
      these responses as possible.

      Volunteers in each of 5 groups receive vaccine or placebo by intramuscular injection at
      Months 0, 1, and 6. All patients receive one of two doses of QS-21 along with vaccine or
      placebo and some groups receive alum as follows:

      Group 1: low-dose MN rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 2: high-dose MN
      rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 3: AIDSVAX B/E (injection contains each of
      the two vaccine components, HIV-1 MN rgp120 and A244 rgp120/HIV-1) plus QS-21 plus alum (13
      volunteers).

      Group 4: high-dose MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 plus alum (13 volunteers). Group 5: placebo
      plus QS-21 (8 volunteers). Volunteers will be closely monitored after each immunization and
      followed for a minimum of 12 months after the initial immunization.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Volunteers must have:

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV within 8 weeks prior to immunization.

          -  CD4 count greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm3.

          -  Normal history and physical examination. [Refer to Laboratory values for additional
             requirements.]

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Volunteers with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

             subject compliance with the protocol.

          -  Recent suicidal ideation or psychosis.

          -  Active syphilis. NOTE: If the serology is documented to be a false positive or due to
             a remote (greater than 6 months) treated infection, the volunteer is eligible.

             showing no evidence of TB and not requiring INH therapy are eligible.
