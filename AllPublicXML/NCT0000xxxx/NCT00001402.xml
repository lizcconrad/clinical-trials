  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human heart is divided into four chambers. One of the four chambers, the left ventricle,
      is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into the circulation.
      Diseases of the heart like congestive heart failure (CHF), can cause the left ventricle to
      function improperly.

      Medications called beta-blockers appear to reverse the abnormalities in the left ventricle
      and frequently improve the function of the left ventricle in patients with different kinds of
      heart disease. How beta-blockers improve left ventricle function is unknown.

      One possible reason for improved function of the left ventricle with beta-blockers is
      improved blood flow to the heart muscle. When a region of the heart is active, it uses more
      fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As heart activity increases, blood flow to
      and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts, researchers can use
      radioactive sugar (glucose) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to observe what
      areas of the heart are receiving more blood flow.

      In this study researchers plan to measure glucose use in heart muscle and blood flow to the
      heart muscle in patients with CHF taking beta-blockers.

    <textblock>
      Deterioration in left ventricular function, which is characteristic in patients with
      congestive heart failure, appears to be a multifactorial process. Beta-blockers appear to
      reverse the deterioration and frequently improve left ventricular function in patients with
      both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The mechanism by which beta-blockers improve
      ejection fraction is not known. Although it is well established that regional flow, function
      and metabolism may improve after coronary revascularization whether beta-blocker therapy will
      have similar salutary results in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. The aim
      of this study is to: 1) quantitate regional glucose uptake and regional blood flow before and
      after chronic beta-blocker administration to patients with congestive heart failure using
      positron emission tomography, 2) determine if alteration in either regional glucose or lipid
      uptake or regional blood flow correlate with improvement in wall motion and global left
      ventricular function, and 3) determine if ischemic and nonischemic myocardium differ in blood
      flow or metabolism.
