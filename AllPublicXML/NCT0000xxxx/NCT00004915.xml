      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using raloxifene may fight endometrial cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of raloxifene in treating patients who
      have persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine response rate and time to disease progression in patients with
      recurrent endometrial cancer treated with raloxifene. II. Determine overall survival in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of raloxifene in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral raloxifene daily. Treatment continues indefinitely in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
