  <brief_summary>

      PRIMARY: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of each of several HIV-1 derived immunogens
      versus control in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500
      cells/mm3.

      SECONDARY: To determine whether significant advantages to any one vaccine exist.

      Before large clinical trials of anti-HIV vaccines are undertaken, it is important to
      determine whether there are significant advantages to any one of the vaccines currently
      offered for such studies.

      Before large clinical trials of anti-HIV vaccines are undertaken, it is important to
      determine whether there are significant advantages to any one of the vaccines currently
      offered for such studies.

      Patients are randomized to receive one of four vaccines or one of two placebo controls. The
      vaccines are: rgp 120/HIV-1IIIB, rgp 120/HIV-1MN, rgp 120/HIV-1SF, and env 2-3. The two
      control immunogens are aluminum hydroxide (alum) and BIOCINE Placebo Vaccine 2 (MF-59
      adjuvant emulsion in citrate buffer). Patients are vaccinated at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      28, and 36. If significant benefit is seen among vaccine patients, then placebo patients may
      receive vaccination with one of the immunogens producing an immune response.
