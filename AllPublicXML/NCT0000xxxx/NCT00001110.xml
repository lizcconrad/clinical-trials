  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see: (1) how the amount of HIV in the lungs compares to that
      in the blood; (2) if HAART reduces the amount of HIV in the lungs; and (3) if HAART reduces
      lung inflammation in HIV-infected patients.

      Lung-cell inflammation in HIV-infected patients is probably caused by HIV infection of these
      cells. The amount of inflammation may correspond to the amount of HIV (viral load) in the
      lungs (i.e., mild inflammation indicates a low amount of HIV; severe inflammation indicates a
      high amount of HIV). HAART is used to decrease the amount of HIV in the body. If HAART is
      able to decrease viral load in the lungs, it should also be able to decrease lung-cell
      inflammation in these patients.

    <textblock>
      Lymphocytic alveolitis in HIV-infected patients probably represents a local immune response
      to HIV-infected cells in the lung. The intensity of lymphocytic alveolitis may therefore
      reflect the viral load in the lung. If so, treatment that reduces viral load in the lung
      (e.g., HAART) should also decrease the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the
      alveolar space and should return pulmonary immune responses toward normal.

      Patients are stratified by CD4 count: less than 200 cells/mm3 or 200 - 500 cells/mm3. BAL is
      performed and blood samples are collected prior to initiation of HAART and after 1 and 6
      months of HAART. If a patient has detectable HIV in the lung after 6 months of HAART, the
      patient is asked to submit to an optional fourth BAL after 12 months of HAART. BAL fluid and
      cells are analyzed for HIV viral load, percent lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets. Responses
      in the lung are compared to simultaneous changes in these variables found in the peripheral
      blood. Each patient serves as his/her own control.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Have a CD4 count less than or equal to 500 cells/mm3 and an HIV RNA level greater than
             or equal to 5000 copies/ml.

          -  Are about to start a regimen of at least 3 anti-HIV drugs (HAART).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have ever received protease inhibitors (PIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
             inhibitors (NNRTIs).

          -  Have had signs or symptoms of lung disease in the past 30 days (pneumonia, bronchitis,
             emphysema, asthma, severe cough, or severe shortness of breath).

          -  Have received certain medications, including HIV vaccines.

          -  Have received chemotherapy within 30 days prior to study entry, or have cancer that
             will require chemotherapy.

          -  Are pregnant and will be beyond the first 3 months of pregnancy by Week 24 (Month 6)
             of the study.
