      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug TNFR:Fc to treat uveitis
      (eye inflammation) in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In other studies, TNFR:Fc
      significantly reduced joint pain and swelling in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
      and the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for that use. Because medicines
      for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this study will examine whether
      TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis.

      Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids,
      and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have
      refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination. The eye
      exam includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye
      (retina), and front of the eye, including measurements of protein and inflammation.
      Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are
      taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test
      and joint evaluation will also be done.

      Study participants will be given a shot of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and may
      continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate. They will
      have follow-up examinations at week two and months one, two, three and four. Those who wish
      to continue treatment after the fourth month can receive the drug for another eight months
      and will have follow-up exams at months six, nine and 12, and one month after treatment ends.
      Each follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an evaluation of side
      effects or discomfort from the medicine.

    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities for uveitis associated with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)
      including corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are associated with significant
      side effects. These treatments are not effective for all children. A soluble tumor necrosis
      factor receptor (TNFR:Fc) named Etanercept, may inhibit the inflammatory response of uveitis.
      This randomized double-masked phase I/II clinical trial will provide limited safety and
      efficacy information regarding the use of Etanercept for the treatment of uveitis associated
      with JRA. Fifteen patients will be randomized with a 2 to 1 randomization plan (10 to receive
      Etanercept, 5 to receive placebo) and followed for 6 months. After the 6 month visit, all
      patients will receive open label Etanercept for an additional 6 months. Patients will be
      switched to open label Etanercept, or withdrawn from study therapy prior to 6 months, if they
      a) experience a greater than 10 letter or greater drop in visual acuity due to inflammation,
      for patients using the ETDRS chart (a 2 line drop due to inflammation, for patients using the
      B-VAT method) or b) develop a sight-threatening inflammatory ophthalmic or joint lesion
      requiring immediate increase in systemic anti-inflammatory therapy or a periocular injection
      of corticosteriods or c) at 4 months, have greater than 1 plus anterior chamber cell grade in
      either eye and are receiving topical corticosteroids on a schedule of TID or more frequently.
      Investigators will remain masked to original treatment assignment unless warranted by
      clinical care considerations. Primary safety outcomes include the occurrence of any severe
      adverse event at least possibly related to study therapy, including a two step increase in
      anterior chamber cells, or the occurrence of serious infection or sepsis. Primary ophthalmic
      outcomes include measures of anterior chamber cells and a change in topical or systemic
      anti-inflammatory medications used to treat uveitis. Primary ophthalmic and JRA outcome
      analysis will be performed at 6 months, and again at 12 months. Patients unmasked or switched
      to open label Etanercept prior to month 6 or withdrawing from the study drug prior to month
      12 will be considered failures.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Meet American College of Rheumatology Criteria for JRA.

        Have active anterior uveitis defined as the presence of inflammatory cells (Grade 1+ or
        higher) in the anterior chamber of at least one eye or the current use of topical
        corticosteroids to control exacerbation of disease at a frequency of TID or higher.
