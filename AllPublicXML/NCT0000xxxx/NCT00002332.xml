        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV infection (no evidence of AIDS).

          -  CD4 count &lt;= 400 cells/mm3 within 6 weeks prior to study entry (CD4 count changed to
             100 - 400 cells/mm3 per amendment).

          -  Tolerated the current nucleoside analog antiretroviral treatment for at least 4 weeks
             prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thymopentin or any component of the formulation.

          -  Significant chronic underlying medical illness that would impede study participation.

          -  Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy related to nucleoside analog antiretroviral
             treatment.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine, didanosine, or dideoxycytidine.

          -  HIV vaccines or any investigational or non-FDA approved medication or immunomodulatory
             or experimental therapy within 30 days prior to study entry.

        Patients with the following prior condition are excluded:

        Abnormal chest x-ray consistent with active opportunistic infection within 6 weeks prior to
        study entry.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any prior antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine, didanosine, or dideoxycytidine
             within 30 days prior to study entry.

        Required:

          -  Current nucleoside analog antiretroviral treatment.

        Required:

          -  Nucleoside analog antiretroviral treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.
