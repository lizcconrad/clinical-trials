      To evaluate the effects (up to one year of age) of indomethacin on the clinical course of
      patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants (24 hours old or less) and to assess the
      relative merits of indomethacin and surgery in infants with persistent respiratory distress
      who were not treated early with indomethacin. Two concurrent trials were performed.

      BACKGROUND:

      The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus is higher in premature infants than in full-term
      infants and is highest in premature infants who have respiratory distress syndrome. It is
      generally agreed that intervention in an asymptomatic infant with a small left-to-right shunt
      is unnecessary, since the patent ductus almost invariably closes spontaneously and thus does
      not require surgery. A few infants will demonstrate signs of a large shunt during the course
      of respiratory distress syndrome. Many of these infants will improve with medical management
      of congestive heart failure, but others require surgical closure. A third group of babies
      with respiratory distress have severe progressive pulmonary disease requiring ventilatory
      support. There was disagreement as to whether elimination of the patent ductus in these
      infants resulted in decreased mortality. A variety of therapeutic approaches was being used,
      and there was no convincing evidence of the superiority of one treatment over another.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Trial A was a randomized, double-blind trial in which indomethacin plus usual medical therapy
      was compared with a placebo plus medical therapy. Where this regimen was unsuccessful, the
      code was broken, and infants who received indomethacin were treated surgically. Infants who
      had received placebo in Trial A were entered, if there were no contraindications to
      indomethacin, into Trial B. In Trial B, infants were randomized to surgery or indomethacin
      therapy. Those in whom indomethacin treatment was unsuccessful were treated surgically. The
      Recruitment and Intervention Phase began in April 1979. All patients were enrolled by March
      31, 1981, and followed for one year after enrollment.
