  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of a tumor cell vaccine and interferon gamma in
      patients with refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. Vaccines made from a person's cancer
      cells may make the body build an immune response to and kill their tumor cells. Combining
      vaccine therapy with interferon gamma may be a more effective treatment for epithelial
      ovarian cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether intraperitoneal (IP) injections of epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells
      infected with ALVAC-hB7.1 and IP interferon gamma have acceptable toxicity and produce any
      clinical responses in patients with refractory ovarian epithelial cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ALVAC-hB7.1 infected tumor cells.

      Patients receive ALVAC-hB7.1 infected tumor cells intraperitoneally (IP) on days 4, 11, and
      18. Patients also receive interferon gamma IP on days 8, 10, 15, and 17. In the absence of
      disease progression, up to 6 courses of therapy may be given. If insufficient tumor cells are
      available to continue treatment with tumor cell derived vaccine, interferon gamma may be
      given alone. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of ALVAC-hB7.1 infected
      tumor cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
