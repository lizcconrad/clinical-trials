      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining combination chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and combination chemotherapy
      in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory large cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory
      CD20-positive diffuse large cell, immunoblastic, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma treated
      with cytoreduction and mobilization with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
      (RICE). II. Assess the ability of this regimen to deplete the stem cell harvest of B-cells
      and tumor cells in these patients. III. Assess the efficacy of this regimen to mobilize
      peripheral blood progenitor cells in these patients. IV. Assess the safety and toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Cytoreduction and mobilization: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and
      carboplatin IV on day 4 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 3-5. Chemotherapy repeats every
      2 weeks for 3 courses. Patients receive rituximab IV on day -2 before initiation of
      chemotherapy and on day 1 of each course of chemotherapy. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 7-14 of each course of chemotherapy. Patients with complete
      or partial response after completion of course 3 continue to receive G-CSF SC daily until
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. When blood counts recover, PBSC are
      harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. If sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells are not
      obtained, patients undergo bone marrow harvest.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
