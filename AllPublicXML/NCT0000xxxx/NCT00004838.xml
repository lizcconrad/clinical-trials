      OBJECTIVES:

      Compare growth of lead-poisoned children receiving succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA)
      plus standard treatment to those receiving standard treatment only.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive succimer in
      addition to standard treatment (arm I) or standard treatment only (arm II).

      Succimer is administered orally 3 times a day for 7 days, then twice daily for 19 days.
      Patients may receive up to 3 courses.

      Standard treatment consists of a medical history and physical examination, environmental
      assessment with modification to reduce lead exposure, dietary modifications to decrease lead
      absorption, the use of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement with iron, developmental
      screening and intervention, and frequent follow up of lead levels.

      If blood lead level rises above 45 mcg/dL, patient receives succimer regardless of treatment
      arm originally assigned.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 weeks for 2 months, then every 3 months for 6 months, and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Asymptomatic children with confirmed venous blood lead of at
        least 20 mcg/dL and less than 45 mcg/dL Children with blood lead of 45 mcg/dL or greater
        are not randomized in this study since they probably will receive succimer regardless of
        being enrolled in this study --Patient Characteristics-- Other: No contraindications to the
        use of succimer (i.e., allergy or a lack of lead safe environment in which to live during
        chelation)
