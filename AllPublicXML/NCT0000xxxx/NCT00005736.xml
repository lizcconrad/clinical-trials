      BACKGROUND:

      The study was part of an initiative &quot;Interventions to Improve Asthma Management and
      Prevention at School&quot;. The Broad Agency Announcement was released in June, 1994.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study used a randomized intervention trial to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive
      school-based asthma program to increase linkages with primary care physicians, to increase
      self-management activities, and to reduce morbidity associated with asthma. The study used a
      nested design in which the schools were the unit of design, allocation, and analysis. Effects
      were measured from aggregate data about students and data from school measures to control
      asthma. There were three components to the intervention. First, case finding for asthma
      through screening in both intervention and control schools. Second, a linkage management
      system that connected the child with a source of primary care and enhanced communication
      among the school nurse, the primary care physician, and parents. Third, the development and
      implementation of interactive multimedia and decision support system techniques to tailor
      individualized learning opportunities for children with asthma. The interventions occurred in
      the school setting and included tailored feedback for children, teachers, nurses, primary
      care providers, and the family. Assessments were made of the potential for diffusion of the
      components to target audiences.
