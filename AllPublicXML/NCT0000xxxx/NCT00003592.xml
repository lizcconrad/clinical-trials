      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether methotrexate or paclitaxel is more
      effective in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of methotrexate with that of
      paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer that cannot be treated
      with cisplatin.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the progression free survival, median survival, and overall survival
      in cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      following weekly outpatient methotrexate (arm I) versus paclitaxel (arm II). II. Compare the
      response rate of patients in the two treatment arms. III. Compare the Trial Outcome Index
      scores of patients in the two treatment arms. IV. Compare the weight change, neurologic
      toxicity, and mucositis scores of patients in the two treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by performance status (0-1 vs 2)
      and age (less than 60 vs at least 60). Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate IV
      bolus every week for 4 weeks (arm I) or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour every week for 4 weeks (arm
      II). All patients receive at least 4 weeks of treatment (1 course). Patients continue
      treatment for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 230 patients accrued into this study over 2.4 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed advanced, incurable, squamous cell
        carcinoma of the head and neck Recurrent disease in a previously irradiated field must be
        biopsy proven or documented unequivocally by physical exam or radiograph(s) Measurable or
        evaluable disease Patients with ECOG performance status of 0-1 must be ineligible for
        protocol E-1395 and unable to tolerate cisplatin-based therapy for 1 or more of the
        following reasons: Hearing loss that precludes cisplatin Unable to handle a fluid load
        necessitated by cisplatin-based treatment, due to underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease
        Mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.6-2.0 mg/dL) or creatinine clearance of 40-60 mL/min
        that would make cisplatin treatment difficult, if not dangerous History of brain metastases

        of carcinomatous meningitis
