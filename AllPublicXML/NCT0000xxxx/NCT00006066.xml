  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      given with anti-HIV therapy in children with HIV infection. This study will also determine
      the best dose of IL-2 to give children.

      IL-2 is an important substance produced by the body's white blood cells that helps the body
      fight infection. People with HIV infection do not produce enough IL-2. It is hoped that IL-2
      treatment will help boost the immune system in people with HIV infection. It has not been
      studied very much in children and doctors need to know what doses are safe to give.

    <textblock>
      One of the challenges in effective combination therapy in HIV-infected patients is the
      ability to achieve immune reconstitution. IL-2 is hypothesized to restore and/or preserve the
      immune system when added to potent antiretroviral regimens. This study will evaluate
      restoration of immune functions of CD4 cells and will also determine the best way to deliver
      IL-2 in a safe and effective way.

      Part I: Patients add a 5-day course of subcutaneous IL-2 every 8 weeks for up to 48 weeks (6
      cycles) to their HAART therapy. Three dose levels of IL-2 are administered. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      5/3/01: It is strongly recommended, but not required, that] the first and second cycles of
      IL-2 are given in the hospital on an inpatient basis. The parent or patient is trained to
      give the injections and has the option of administering subsequent injections at home.
      Patients are monitored for CD4 and CD8 cell count and viral load. Enrollment into Part 1
      begins at the lowest dose level; assuming no serious toxicities (Grade 3 or higher) occur,
      patients are enrolled into higher dose levels. The highest tolerated dose is established.

      Part 2: After the highest tolerated dose is established in Part 1, additional patients are
      randomized to receive HAART alone (Arm 1), HAART with high-dose IL-2 (Arm 2), or HAART with
      low-dose IL-2 (Arm 3). High-dose IL-2 is given twice daily at the highest dose tolerated in
      Part 1 for 5 days every 8 weeks for 6 cycles. Low-dose IL-2 is given once a day every day for
      48 weeks. For Arms 2 and 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 5/3/01: (except patients in the pharmacokinetic
      substudy), it is strongly recommended, but not required, that] IL-2 is given the first week
      on an inpatient basis by hospital personnel. As in Part 1, there is the option of
      administering the remaining injections at home. Intensive toxicity monitoring, routine
      lymphocyte subsets, and quantitative HIV RNA are performed on all patients at specified time
      points during the study. The first 12 patients in Arms 2 and 3 have pharmacokinetic testing
      with frequent blood samples drawn at intervals, some of which require staying up to 12 hours
      at the clinic. Diphtheria/tetanus immunizations and bacteriophage phi X174 immunizations are
      administered to all patients to determine antibody responses.

        Inclusion Criteria

        A child may be eligible for this trial if he/she:

          -  Is HIV-positive.

          -  Is 2 to 18 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18).

          -  Has received 12 or more weeks of anti-HIV drug therapy, consisting of at least 3
             drugs. This combination may include a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
             (NRTI), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor, or 3
             NRTIs. Combinations of NRTIs may not include abacavir (ABC). Patients may have taken
             ABC if it was not in combination with 2 other NRTIs. (This reflects a change in the
             requirement for anti-HIV therapy.)

          -  Has a plasma HIV RNA level of less than 10,000 copies/ml.

          -  Has evidence of a weakened immune system (based on CD4 cell counts and absolute CD4
             percentage less than 25 percent). (This reflects a change in how a weakened immune
             system is defined.)

          -  Has a parent or guardian who is willing to comply with study requirements.

          -  Has symptoms of HIV infection.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A child will not be eligible for this study if he/she:

          -  Has an active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection.

          -  Is pregnant.

          -  Is taking certain medications, such as steroids or other drugs that affect the immune
             system, within 6 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Is taking ABC.

          -  Is taking certain antibodies.

          -  (Exclusion criteria reflect changes.)
