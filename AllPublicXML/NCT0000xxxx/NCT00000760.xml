      To study the anti-HIV activity of the various doses of Ro 24-7429 monotherapy based on
      virologic and immunologic endpoints. To study the safety and tolerance of Ro 24-7429. To
      explore relationships between exposure to Ro 24-7429 and its metabolites and antiviral
      activity and drug toxicity. To determine a safe, tolerable, and active dose regimen of Ro
      24-7429, and to make preliminary observations of Ro 24-7429 in combination with another
      antiretroviral nucleoside.

      The HIV genome contains a number of genes that regulate viral replication. Control of the
      activity of these genes and their encoded proteins represents a potential target for
      development of new antiretroviral drugs. The tat (transactivator of transcription of HIV)
      antagonist Ro 24-7429 is the first compound for clinical testing that utilizes this approach
      for therapy of HIV infection.

      The HIV genome contains a number of genes that regulate viral replication. Control of the
      activity of these genes and their encoded proteins represents a potential target for

      for therapy of HIV infection.

      Ninety-six patients (four treatment arms of 24 patients each) are randomized to receive oral
      Ro 24-7429 at 1 of 3 doses or nucleoside control (either zidovudine or didanosine). The study
      will be blinded only for the arms receiving Ro 24-7429. Treatment continues for 12 weeks.
      After 12 weeks, patients on the nucleoside control arm receive the highest tolerated dose of
      Ro 24-7429 in addition to their nucleoside.
