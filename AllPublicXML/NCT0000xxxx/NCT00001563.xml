  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of AIDS-related Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is poor, especially in the relapsed
      setting. There is no standard treatment, and the few small studies that have been conducted
      have reported dismal outcomes. The purpose of this study is to pilot the use of EPOCH plus
      rituximab in previously treated AIDS-related lymphoma. Clinical endpoints of the study
      include toxicity and response. Progression-free and overall survival will be measured. Tumors
      will be evaluated for p53 mutations, p-16, bcl-2 expression, tumor proliferation, c-myc and
      EBV when possible....
