      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      advanced bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of R115777 in terms of objective response in patients
      with advanced transitional cell cancer of the urothelial tract. II. Determine the safety of
      this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to disease progression in
      these patients with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for at least 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the
        urothelial tract not curable by surgery or radiotherapy Bladder, renal pelvis, or ureter
        Stage II, III, or IV (T2-4, N0-3, M0-1) with unresectable disease Poorly differentiated
        transitional cell carcinoma or predominant transitional cell carcinoma with foci of
        squamous differentiation or rare foci of adenocarcinoma allowed No adenocarcinoma, small
        cell carcinoma, sarcoma, or squamous cell carcinoma Bidimensionally measurable disease No
        disease confined to the bladder only No soft tissue disease irradiated within the past 2
