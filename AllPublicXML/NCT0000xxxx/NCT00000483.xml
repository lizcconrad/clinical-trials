      To determine whether there were any long term sequelae of the drugs used in the Coronary Drug
      Project (estrogens, dextrothyroxine, nicotinic acid, clofibrate).

      BACKGROUND:

      Three of the CDP treatments (two doses of estrogen and dextrothyroxine) were stopped
      prematurely because of toxicity. At the time the treatments were stopped, it was thought that
      future assessment of the status of patients on those treatments would be important to
      evaluate long-term sequellae. Another clinical trial evaluating clofibrate for primary
      prevention found that more patients on that treatment than on placebo had died. This effect
      persisted even after the treatment was stopped. Therefore, it was considered necessary to
      follow the CDP patients on clofibrate.

      Of the original 834l patients, about 6000 were still alive in March l975. Cause-specific
      mortality in those patients was assessed through March l980.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The vital status of the subjects known to be alive at the end of the CDP in March l975 was
      assessed as of March l980. This was accomplished through questioning the local investigators,
      letters to the subjects, and by use of Social Security Administration and National Death
      Index records.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)
      System.
