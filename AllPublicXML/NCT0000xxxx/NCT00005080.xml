    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have lymphoma
      that has not been treated previously or that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete and partial remission rates and remission duration in patients with
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or refractory or relapsed noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma
      treated with 506U78.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving complete response receive up to 8 courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year or until
      relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) or noncutaneous peripheral
             T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (needle aspirate or core biopsy of tissue or marrow as the sole
             means of diagnosis is not acceptable), confirmed by immunophenotyping, including:

               -  Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome

               -  Peripheral T-Cell lymphomas (medium, mixed medium-large, large cell)

               -  Variants of peripheral T-Cell lymphoma

               -  Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell lymphoma (AILD); angiocentric lymphoma; intestinal
                  T-Cell Lymphoma; adult T-Cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL); anaplastic Large Cell
                  (CD30+) lymphoma, T-cell type Failure to submit pathology slides within 60 days
                  of patient registration will result in patient being declared ineligible; Note:
                  patients diagnosed more than one year prior to entry on this protocol must have a
                  repeat lymph node biopsy. In the event of rapid tumor growth, rising LDH, or the
                  onset of B symptoms in a period of time less than one year a rebiopsy is also
                  required

          -  Biopsy and immunophenotyping should be performed to document relapse after prior
             treatment

          -  CTCL patients may have received one prior course of single-agent systemic chemotherapy
             for CTCL, but may not have received a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen; patients may
             have received prior local, topical, radiation- or electron beam-based, or
             chemotherapy-based treatment; examples of the latter would include, but not be limited
             to, cytokines such as interferon, retinoids, monoclonal antibodies, and fusion toxins

          -  PTCL patients may have failed only one or two prior treatment regimens (one of which
             may include peripheral stem cell transplantation)

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; patients with CTCL must have skin lesions which
             are measurable; whenever CT is specified, it should be understood that MRI may be
             substituted as long as the measurements for tumor response are made on two successive
             studies employing the same procedure

               -  The following lesions are not considered measurable:

                    -  Barium studies

                    -  Ascites or pleural effusion

                    -  Bony disease (lesions if present should be noted)

                    -  Bone marrow

          -  No CNS lymphoma requiring intrathecal or craniospinal radiation therapy

          -  No history of a seizure disorder or grade 3 neurologic toxicity during prior treatment
             of lymphoma. Baseline neurologic status of all eligible patients is to be carefully
             recorded (particularly in elderly patients and those with conditions potentially
             predisposed to neurotoxicity, such as diabetes mellitus and prior exposure to
             neurotoxic agents); patients with prior neurologic dysfunction or toxicity from any
             cause must have recovered to grade 1 neurologic toxicity/dysfunction

          -  Performance status 0-2

          -  No known HIV disease; patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for
             exposure to the HIV virus; patients who test positive or who are known to be infected
             are not eligible; an HIV test is not required for entry on protocol, but is required
             if the patient is perceived to be at risk

          -  Calculated Creatinine Clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min

               -  Unless attributable to lymphoma

               -  To be calculated by method of Cockcroft-Gault

          -  Bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Patients with hepatic dysfunction should enroll on CALGB 69803
