  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of two anti-HIV drug combinations in
      fighting HIV infection in patients whose viral loads (levels of HIV in the blood) rose with
      other anti-HIV drug treatments.

      Patients experiencing virologic failure while receiving an IDV-containing antiretroviral
      regimen will receive the 3TC/ABC/APV/NFV combination. Patients experiencing virologic failure
      while receiving an NFV-containing antiretroviral regimen will receive the 3TC/ABC/APV/IDV
      combination.

        Inclusion Criteria

        You may be eligible for this trial if you:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are 13 years of age or older.

          -  Are currently taking anti-HIV drugs, 1 of which must be NFV or IDV, and have taken
             these same drugs for at least 12 weeks.

          -  In the last 16 weeks your viral load (level of HIV in the blood) dropped below 400
             copies/ml and has since increased to at least 1,000 copies/ml, even though you
             continue to take your anti-HIV drugs.

          -  Have the written consent of a parent or legal guardian if you are under age 18.

          -  Agree to practice abstinence or use effective barrier methods of birth control (unless
             you are physically incapable of becoming pregnant).

          -  Are willing to complete the 48-week study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        You will not be eligible for this trial if you:

          -  Have ever taken the following anti-HIV drugs: ABC, APV, efavirenz (EFV), delavirdine
             (DLV), nevirapine (NVP), or loviride.

          -  Have certain AIDS-related infections or diseases, have other serious medical
             conditions such as diabetes and certain types of heart trouble, or have a history of
             lymphoma.

          -  Have had certain types of hepatitis in the past 6 months.

          -  Have received an HIV vaccine in the past 3 months or a flu vaccine in the past 30
             days.

          -  Have certain digestion problems that make it difficult to take anti-HIV drugs by
             mouth.

          -  Have received certain other drugs or treatments in the past 30 days, or will need
             certain drugs or treatments during the study.
