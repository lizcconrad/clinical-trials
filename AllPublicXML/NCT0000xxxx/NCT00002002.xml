  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of l-leucovorin in
      preventing toxicity from high dose trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) used as a
      therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with AIDS.
