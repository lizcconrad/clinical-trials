    <textblock>
      In the United States, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)is the leading cause of death in
      infants between the ages of 1 and 12 months. The etiology of SIDS is still not clear although
      a number of risk factors have been identified. Sleeping on the stomach has been identified as
      a major risk for SIDS. The rates of SIDS have dropped substantially in countries in which the
      usual sleep position has changed from the stomach to the side or back. Back sleep has been
      shown to be the most stable and safest position. The American Academy of Pediatrics now
      recommends the back sleeping position for all healthy infants. Since the American Academy of
      Pediatrics began advocating the back sleep position, the incidence of SIDS has decreased by
      more than 40% in this country. However, the decrease has not been uniform across segments of
      the population. Black infants continue to have a higher rate of SIDS compared with other
      groups. This discrepancy could be related to infant sleep position practices. Several studies
      have shown that infants born to low income, minority, inner-city families were more likely to
      be placed on the stomach to sleep. Education appears to influence choice of sleep position
      and may explain, at least to some degree, the difference in choice of sleep position among
      certain groups. We believe that uniform education of parents will influence the sleep
      position that parents choose for their baby. We will undertake this initial study to document
      what parents choose to do with their infants regarding sleep position and why they make these
      choices so that we can improve our educational approach.
