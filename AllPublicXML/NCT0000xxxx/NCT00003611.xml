      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of acitretin may be an effective way to prevent
      the recurrence or further development of skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of acitretin in preventing skin
      cancers in patients with at least two previously treated skin cancers who have undergone
      organ transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the chemopreventive efficacy of acitretin in immunosuppressed solid organ
           transplant recipients with a history of multiple previous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or
           squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) skin cancer resections.

        -  Evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) as a possible etiologic cofactor in the development
           of cutaneous epidermal dysplasia/carcinoma from skin tissues of these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of acitretin on potential surrogate endpoint biomarkers and HPV DNA
           in normal (sun protected), sun-exposed, and dysplastic and carcinoma (SCC/BCC) skin
           specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (at least 18 to
      under 50 vs 50 to 59 vs 60 to 69 vs 70 and over), number of prior skin cancers in past 5
      years (2 vs 3 vs at least 4), time since most recent skin cancer occurrence (less than 12
      months vs at least 12 months), sunburn susceptibility (none vs moderate vs high), visible
      skin damage (mild vs moderate vs severe).

      Patients receive either oral acitretin or placebo daily for 2 years. Skin biopsies are
      obtained at 1 year from normal areas and from any areas with skin cancer for genetic studies.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.
