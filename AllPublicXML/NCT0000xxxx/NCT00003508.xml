      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating
      patients with advanced mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 to patients with stage IV
           mesothelioma.

        -  Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston
      AS2-1 IV six times per day until the maximum dose is reached.

      Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 3 months, patients with stable or responding disease may
      continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least
      8 months beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
