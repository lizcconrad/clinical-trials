      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) in the
      treatment of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).

      II. Determine the side-effects and benefits associated with DAP.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to receive 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 5 days,
      after which treatment is discontinued and patients are observed for at least 24 hours. At the
      end of the blinded study, patients may then elect to take open label DAP orally 3 times daily
      for 6 months; those who do so are monitored for clinical effects and side effects for at
      least 6 months.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) based on weakness that
        predominates in proximal limb muscles and electromyography (EMG) findings of small
        amplitude muscle responses to nerve stimulation, which decrease further during nerve
        stimulation at 5 Hz and which increase at least 2-fold after maximum voluntary contraction
        of the muscle for 10-20 seconds Quantified Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) clinical score at least
        5 --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- Chemotherapy: No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy:
        Patients receiving immunosuppressants must be on the same dose of medication for at least 3
        months prior to study entry Radiotherapy: No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: No concurrent
        surgery Other: Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors must discontinue the medication
        at study entry if possible, or else be on the same dose of medication for at least 1 month
        prior to study entry --Patient Characteristics-- Hematopoietic: No significant hematologic
        disease Hepatic: No significant hepatic disease Renal: No significant renal disease
        Cardiovascular: No cardiac arrhythmia or significant cardiac disease Neurologic: No seizure
        disorder Other: Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test required of fertile women Effective
        contraception required of fertile women
