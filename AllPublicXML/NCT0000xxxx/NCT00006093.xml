      RATIONALE: EMD 121974 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of EMD 121974 in treating patients who
      have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of EMD 121974 in
           patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival, clinical response rate, duration of
           progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on tumor perfusion, measured with magnetic resonance
           perfusion scan, and markers for angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive EMD 121974 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which more than 2
      of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined,
      additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 6 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within
      2-3 months. A total of 23-38 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 5-10
      months.
