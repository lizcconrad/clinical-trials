      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients with
      recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate and toxicity of irinotecan when administered to
           patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease category (aggressive vs indolent vs mantle cell
      lymphoma). Patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma are further stratified as to being
      refractory (no complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to initial therapy) vs
      recurrent (CR or PR to initial therapy); i.e, the following subcategories are used:

        -  Stratum I:Refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)

        -  Stratum II:Recurrent aggressive NHL

        -  Stratum III: Refractory indolent NHL

        -  Stratum IV: Recurrent indolent NHL

        -  Stratum V: Mantle cell NHL All patients receive irinotecan intravenously every 21 days.
           Patients achieving CR or PR receive 6 courses. Patients may receive bone marrow
           transplantation after at least 2 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 18 patients per stratum; if at least three patients
      respond, an additional 25 patients will be accrued for a total of 43 evaluable patients per
      stratum. The total number accrued will be 90-215 over a period of approximately 3 years.
