      BACKGROUND:

      The blood pressure of a significant percentage of the hypertensive population, and the
      normotensive population at a high risk for the development of hypertension (Blacks and older
      individuals), is sodium (salt)-dependent. That is to say, increasing the intake of salt will
      increase blood pressure in these individuals; conversely, and more importantly, decreasing
      the intake of salt will reduce blood pressure.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators believed that the mechanisms responsible for sodium-dependent blood
      pressure were only indirectly linked to race, sex, and age. Their research was consistent
      with the hypothesis that sodium-dependent blood pressure control resulted from decreased
      responsiveness of the renal and adrenal blood pressure regulatory systems. This produced
      abnormal daily blood pressure patterns, with reduced fluctuation resulting in extended
      periods of increased blood pressure. The increased cardiovascular load led to the early
      development of cardiovascular and renal disease, including hypertension. They tested this
      hypothesis by identifying 'high risk' and 'normal risk' subjects based on renal responses to
      sodium restriction. The subjects were equal numbers of healthy males and females, Blacks and
      whites, between the ages of 55-70 years. Using an innovative approach, they then examined the
      influence of risk status on 24-hour patterns of blood pressure, hormonal activity, and sodium
      handling. Finally, they determined the clinical significance of the profiles by examining
      changes in cardiac and renal status at a two-year follow-up.
