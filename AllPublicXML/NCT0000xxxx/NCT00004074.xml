    <textblock>
      Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a
      person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab
      can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 and
      trastuzumab in treating patients who have cancer that has high levels of HER2/neu and has not
      responded to previous therapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-12 (IL-12) when combined with
      trastuzumab in patients with HER2-Neu overexpressing malignancies.

      II. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Analyze any expression of interferon-inducible genes in tumor tissues of these patients
      after receiving this regimen.

      IV. Characterize natural killer cytokine production in patients treated with this regimen.

      V. Determine serum interferon gamma levels in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-12 (IL-12).

      Patients receive an initial loading dose of trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of the
      first week and a maintenance dose of trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each
      subsequent week. Patients receive IL-12 IV on days 2 and 5 beginning on week 3. Treatment
      with maintenance trastuzumab and IL-12 repeats weekly for 14 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease continue
      treatment for up to 38 additional weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
