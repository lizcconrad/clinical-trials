  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal disease which is increasing in incidence with the increase
      in immunocompromised persons in our population. Persons with prolonged neutropenia secondary
      to cytotoxic chemotherapies are at the highest risk for acute aspergillosis. Patients
      undergoing bone marrow transplantation, receiving prolonged corticosteroid or other
      immunosuppressive therapies, and persons with HIV infection and AIDS are also at risk. Even
      with antifungal therapy, aspergillosis in its acute invasive forms has a high mortality. In
      bone marrow transplantation patients and in those whose infection involves the brain, this
      mortality is greater than 90%. Amphotericin B in its conventional form, is the current
      standard treatment for this disease. Response to therapy with amphotericin B usually ranges
      between 20-60% in most studies. The higher response rates are usually seen in those patients
      who can tolerate this agent for at least 14 days. Because of its nephrotoxicity and other
      adverse effects, alternatives to conventional amphotericin B have been sought. These
      currently include liposomal forms of amphotericin B and itraconazole. Although these forms
      show a decrease in adverse effects, the efficacy of these drugs has not been shown to be
      equivalent to conventional amphotericin B.

      Voriconazole is an investigational antifungal drug currently being brought to phase III
      trials in the US. This azole has been shown active against Aspergillus spp. in vitro, and in
      animal models and early human trials to be effective against aspergillosis. It has been shown
      to be well-tolerated and is available in an intravenous and oral formulation.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and toleration of voriconazole compared to
      conventional therapy with amphotericin B as primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis
      in immunocompromised patients. Patients will be randomized to open-labelled therapy with
      voriconazole or amphotericin B in a one-to-one ratio.

      older than 12 years old we do not expect to enroll patients younger than 18 years old.
      Patients will be randomized to open-labelled therapy with voriconazole or amphotericin B in a

      <textblock>
        Males and females of greater than 12 years of age with any of the following conditions:

        Allogeneic or autologous bone marrow/ peripheral stem cell transplant.

        Hematological malignancy (including lymphoma).

        Aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (currently on immunosuppressive treatment).

        Solid organ transplantation.

        Solid organ malignancy (after cytotoxic chemotherapy).

        HIV infection/AIDS.

        High dose prolonged corticosteroid therapy (greater than or equal to 20 mg daily of
        prednisone or equivalent for greater than 3 weeks) or prolonged therapy with other
        immunosuppressive agents (e.g., azathioprine, methotrexate).

        WITH a diagnosis of definite or probable acute invasive aspergillosis.

        The fungal infection at baseline should represent a new episode of acute invasive
        aspergillosis. Any course of systemic treatment with amphotericin B (conventional or lipid
        formulation) or itraconazole should have been completed at least 8 weeks prior to study
        entry.

        Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to study participation (patient, relative or
        legal representative). For patients aged 12-17 years, the written informed consent of the
        parents or legal guardian must also be obtained.

        Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at entry and must
        agree to use barrier methods of contraception throughout the study.

        No patients with sarcoidosis, aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

        No patients with chronic invasive aspergillosis with a duration of symptoms or radiological
        findings for more than 4 weeks prior to study entry.

        No patients that have received systemic antifungal therapy at doses greater than 0.5
        mg/kg/day for conventional or lipid formulations of amphotericin B or greater than 200
        mg/day of itraconazole, for more than 96 hours during the two week period prior to study
        entry.

        No patients with a diagnosis of CMV pneumonia.

        No pregnant or lactating females.

        No patients with a history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to azole antifungal agents
        including miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.

        No patients with a history of hypersensitivity or severe intolerance (despite supportive
        therapy) to conventional or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B.

        No subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue the following drugs at least 24 hours
        prior to randomization: Terfenadine, cisapride and astemizole (due to the possibility of
        QTc prolongation); Sulphonylureas (as these compounds have a narrow therapeutic window and
        an increase in plasma levels may lead to hypoglycemia).

        No subjects who have received the following drugs within 14 days prior to randomization:
        Rifampin, carbamazepine and barbiturates as these are potent inducers of hepatic enzymes
        and will result in undetectable levels of voriconazole.

        No patients who are receiving or are likely to received any investigational drug (any
        unlicensed new chemical entity), except one of the following classes of medications: cancer
        chemotherapeutic agents, antiretrovirals, therapies for HIV/AIDS-related opportunistic
        infections.

        No patients who are receiving the following medications or treatments during the study
        period: G-CSF or GM-CSF (for other than of granulocytopenia) any systemic antifungal
        medication active against Aspergillus white blood cell transfusions.

        No patients with the following abnormalities of liver function tests: AST, ALT greater than
        5x ULN (upper limit normal); alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin greater than 5x ULN.

        No patients with renal insufficiency that would contraindicate treatment with initial
        randomized therapy (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl).

        No patients with a life expectancy of less than 72 hours.

        No patients on artificial ventilation, unlikely to be extubated within 24 hours of study
        entry.

        No patients for whom written informed consent cannot be obtained.

        No patients that have already participated in this trial.

        No patients with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect
        patient safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render it unlikely that the
        contemplated course of therapy can be completed.
