  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether zidovudine (AZT) in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation
      prevents the reinfection of donor hematopoietic/lymphoid cells in patients with positive HTLV
      III antibody and large cell/diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Patients who are candidates will be
      evaluated for HTLV III activity and drug levels.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        a transplant are excluded.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other anti-retroviral agents.

        Patients with current life-threatening infection at time of transplant that would preclude
        a transplant are excluded.

        Patients must be:

          -  HTLV III antibody positive by ELISA or Western blot or HTLV III viremia.

          -  At high mortal risk with a diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (ARC).

          -  Also patient must fall into one of the following categories:

          -  Have an HIV seronegative identical twin to serve as a bone marrow donor.

          -  Have documentation of large cell/diffuse histiocytic lymphoma/DPDL.

          -  Be a good risk candidate for bone marrow transplant.
