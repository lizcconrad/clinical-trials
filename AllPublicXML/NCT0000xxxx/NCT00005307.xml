      BACKGROUND:

      Agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia are rare but serious blood diseases that can be caused by
      drugs and other environmental factors. In 1980, there were only limited quantitative
      estimates of the risk between various exposures, particularly drugs, and the two dyscrasias.
      The data were collected in the IAAAS, a multicenter population-based case-control study
      conducted from 1980 to 1986 in eight regions. The study was funded by a pharmaceutical
      company to investigate a single hypothesis, but information was obtained on all drugs and on
      other factors, enabling a general investigation of the dyscrasias.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was for retrospective data analysis only. Standard case-control methods were used.
      In most instances, multivariate analysis was used to control confounding, especially by
      simultaneous use of other causal drugs. Adverse effects and the relative safety of drugs in
      relation to the two dyscrasias were documented. Because the IAAAS was population-based,
      incidence rates were provided directly, and excess risks were estimated for associated drugs.
      Such quantitative measures of association were generally unavailable. Among the drugs that
      were analyzed were various categories such as psychotropics, antihistamines, and
      cardiovascular drugs, and individual drugs such as allopurinol. Factors other than drugs were
      also evaluated, including exposure to radiation and chemicals such as benzene and
      insecticides, history of viral infection, and history of allergy and other conditions.
