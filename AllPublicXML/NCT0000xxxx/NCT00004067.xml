      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel,
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal
      antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether
      combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab is more effective than combination chemotherapy
      alone for treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy
      together with trastuzumab works compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating women
      with node-positive stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel
           with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in women with operable, node-positive breast
           cancer that overexpresses HER2.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on disease-free and overall survival of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of positive nodes (1-3 vs 4-9 vs 10 or more), administration of hormonal therapy (tamoxifen
      vs anastrozole vs neither), surgery/radiotherapy (lumpectomy plus breast irradiation vs
      lumpectomy plus breast irradiation plus regional irradiation vs mastectomy without
      radiotherapy vs mastectomy with radiotherapy), paclitaxel schedule (every 3 weeks vs weekly),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm 1: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Approximately 3 weeks after the last
           course, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours every 21 days for 4 courses OR
           paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 12 weeks (12 doses).

        -  Arm 2: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90
           minutes on day 1 of the first course of paclitaxel. Trastuzumab is then administered IV
           over 30 minutes weekly for 51 weeks, beginning on day 8.

      All patients with estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive tumors receive hormonal therapy*
      for at least 5 years, beginning within 3-12 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy.
      Patients who have received prior tamoxifen for prevention may be treated with additional
      tamoxifen for no more than 5 years at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI).

      NOTE: *Other hormonal therapeutic agents are allowed in sequence with or as an alternative to
      tamoxifen therapy.

      All patients previously treated with lumpectomy undergo breast irradiation beginning after
      completion of chemotherapy and concurrently with trastuzumab (in arm 2) administration.
      Patients previously treated with mastectomy may also receive radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is
      administered daily for 5-6 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,700 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.75
      years.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, excluding her diagnosis
             of breast cancer. (Comorbid conditions should be taken into consideration, but not the
             diagnosis of breast cancer.)

          -  The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer treatment (lumpectomy,
             mastectomy, axillary dissection, or re-excision of lumpectomy margins) and
             randomization must be less than or equal to 84 days.

          -  All of the following staging criteria must be met:

               -  Primary tumor must be T1-3 by clinical and pathologic evaluation.

               -  Ipsilateral nodes must be cN0-1 by clinical evaluation.

               -  Ipsilateral nodes must be pN1, pN2a, or pN3a by pathologic evaluation.

               -  M0

          -  Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy and an axillary dissection or a
             lumpectomy and an axillary dissection. Sentinel node biopsy is permitted, but must be
             followed by an axillary dissection.

          -  The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination.

          -  The tumor must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to randomization. Assays
             performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) require gene amplification to
             be eligible. Assays using immunohistochemistry (IHC) must be performed at an
             NSABP-approved reference laboratory and require a strongly positive staining score.

          -  Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors performed
             on the primary tumor prior to randomization. &quot;Marginal,&quot; &quot;borderline,&quot; etc., results
             (i.e., those not definitely negative) will also be considered positive regardless of
             the methodology used.

          -  At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and
             physical exam, EKG, and PA and lateral chest x-ray within the past 3 months; and a
             bilateral mammogram (or unilateral if patient has had a mastectomy) and a pelvic exam
             (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) within the past year.

          -  Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular
             ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the lower
             limit of normal for the radiology facility. (If LVEF is &gt; 75%, the investigator should
             consider having the LVEF determination reviewed prior to randomization. Following
             randomization, the LVEF determination may be reviewed up until the time of the post-AC
             MUGA. Please note that if a more accurate value is obtained from the review of the
             baseline MUGA, the corrected value must be submitted to the NSABP Biostatistical
             Center before the post-AC MUGA is performed.)

          -  At the time of randomization:

               -  The postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥ 1500/mm3 (or
                  &lt;1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or
                  racial variation of normal).

               -  Postoperative platelet count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3. Significant underlying
                  hematologic disorders must be excluded when the platelet count is above the upper
                  limit of normal for the lab.

          -  There must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e., total
             bilirubin must be ≤ ULN for the lab unless the patient has a chronic grade 1 bilirubin
             elevation (&gt;ULN to ≤1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome; and
             alkaline phosphatase must be &lt;2.5 times the ULN for the lab; and the serum
             glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT [AST]) must be &lt;1.5 times the ULN for the lab.

          -  There must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine
             within or less than the institution's normal range).

          -  Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.
             Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by radiologic evaluation or biopsy. A
             patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or
             roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their
             physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Prior to randomization, the investigator must designate whether the patients who had a
             lumpectomy will receive local or locoregional radiation therapy. For patients who had
             a mastectomy, the investigator must designate whether or not the patient will receive
             radiation therapy. (Pre-randomization discussion and/or consultation with a radiation
             oncologist is encouraged.) Note: Irradiation of any internal mammary nodes is
             prohibited in this trial.

          -  Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: irradiation and surgery

          -  Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection to be followed by breast
             radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:
             Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors &lt;5 cm. However, at the
             investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors ≥ 5 cm are
             eligible. The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive
             tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients in whom pathologic
             examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative
             procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if
             axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the
             resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible.
             Whole breast irradiation is required. Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional,
             but partial breast irradiation and irradiation of any internal mammary nodes are
             prohibited in this trial. Intent to irradiate the axilla or other regional node groups
             must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification
             purposes.

          -  Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: irradiation. The decision
             to use locoregional irradiation in patients who have undergone total mastectomy and
             axillary node dissection must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization
             for stratification purposes. Failure to adhere to the radiation therapy plan will be a
             protocol violation.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast
             suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.

          -  Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.

          -  Nodes staged as clinical N2 or N3 for any reason and nodes staged as pathologic pN2b,
             pN3b, or pN3c.

          -  Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of lobular
             carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible).

          -  Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal
             therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization.
             The only exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of
             28 days anytime after diagnosis and before randomization. In such a case, hormonal
             therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started if indicated following
             chemotherapy.

          -  Prior anthracycline or taxane therapy for any malignancy.

          -  Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement
             therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior
             to randomization.)

          -  Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other
             selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or prevention.
             (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to
             randomization. These medications are not permitted while on the study except for the
             use of tamoxifen as described in the protocol)

          -  Nonmalignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would
             preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would
             prevent prolonged follow-up.

          -  Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of Adriamycin, Taxol or Herceptin. This
             includes:

          -  Active cardiac disease:

               -  angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication;

               -  cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;

               -  severe conduction abnormality;

               -  clinically significant valvular disease;

               -  cardiomegaly on chest x-ray;

               -  ventricular hypertrophy on EKG; or

               -  patients with poorly controlled hypertension, i.e., diastolic greater than 100
                  mm/Hg. (Patients with hypertension who are well controlled on medication are
                  eligible for entry.)

          -  History of cardiac disease:

               -  myocardial infarction documented as a clinical diagnosis or by EKG or any other
                  tests;

               -  documented congestive heart failure; or

               -  documented cardiomyopathy.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes
             pregnant or lactating women based on the fetal toxicity of both tamoxifen and Taxol
             which are listed as Pregnancy Category D agents. Pregnant women who received tamoxifen
             have experienced fetal deaths, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and vaginal
             bleeding. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective barrier
             method of contraception. Hormonal birth control methods are not permitted.

          -  Sensory/motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Toxicity Criteria
             version 2.0.

          -  Contraindications to corticosteroid use which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude participation in this study.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents.

          -  Sensitivity to benzyl alcohol.

          -  Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: irradiation and surgery.
             For patients treated by lumpectomy with axillary dissection, breast irradiation is
             required. Please see guidelines for radiation therapy in Appendix A. In addition, the
             following patients will also be ineligible:

               -  Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be
                  considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy.

               -  Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant
                  mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast
                  remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically
                  benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with
                  clear margins.

               -  Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive
                  tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to
                  obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after
                  the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible.
