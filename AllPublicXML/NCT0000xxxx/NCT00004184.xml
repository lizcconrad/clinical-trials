      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma at high risk for recurrence
      following surgery to remove the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of the human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody vaccine
      (4B5) plus adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) or alum in patients with stage III or IV melanoma
      at high risk for recurrence following surgical resection. II. Determine whether 4B5 is
      associated with the development of humoral and/or cellular anti-anti-idiotypic immune
      response in these patients. III. Determine whether the immune response generated against 4B5
      is also directed against the melanoma-associated GD2 antigen in these patients. IV. Determine
      whether the 4B5 plus adjuvant GM-CSF or alum can elicit an immune response to GD2 in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody vaccine (4B5) in sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously (SQ) on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Patients receive GM-CSF alone SQ at
      vaccination site on days 2, 3, and 4 following immunization. Arm II: Patients receive 4B5
      plus alum SQ on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Cohorts of 5 patients receive treatment every 2 weeks
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
