      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining R115777 with gemcitabine in
      treating patients with advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of tipifarnib in
           combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced cancer.

        -  Investigate potential pharmacokinetic interactions between tipifarnib and gemcitabine in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with measurable or evaluable disease.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral tipifarnib
      every 12 hours beginning on day 2. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than one third
      of the patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, on day 22 of each course, and at the end of
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
