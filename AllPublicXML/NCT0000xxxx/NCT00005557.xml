      To characterize the natural history and biologic spectrum of sleep disordered breathing (SDB)
      and other sleep problems and disorders, and test hypotheses regarding the causes and
      consequences of SDB and other sleep problems and disorders.

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND:

      Recent research has shown that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is much more common than
      previously thought. While it is known that in clinic samples, SDB is associated with
      hypertension, cardiovascular disease and mortality, little is known about the natural history
      of this disorder, particularly in the general population, nor about the causal role of known
      risk factors. The knowledge obtained from the results of this study will help advance the
      field of sleep disorders medicine. Information about longitudinal effects and causal
      relationships may be applied to clinical situations, thus reducing the morbidity and
      mortality associated with this disorder.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this longitudinal study, follow-up polysomnography and other protocols are conducted on an
      established cohort of men and women (age 30-60 years at the time of initial recruitment in
      1989), currently enrolled in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. The study aims to : 1)
      describe the natural history of SDB across middle and older age; 2) investigate associations
      of SDB with early and intermediate markers of cardiovascular dysfunction, damage, and
      cardiovascular disease; 3) investigate the longitudinal association of SDB in accelerated
      cognitive decline; 4) investigate the association of SDB and adverse sleep characteristics
      with age-related risk factors and outcomes.

        In 1988, employees of 4 Wisconsin state agencies, ages 30-60 years, were surveyed regarding
        sleep habits and problems by mail. From these data, a sampling frame was constructed and
        2884 randomly-selected men and women (of 4896 survey respondents) were invited to
        participate in the WSC Study. Recruitment for baseline sleep studies occurred from 1989 to
        2004.
