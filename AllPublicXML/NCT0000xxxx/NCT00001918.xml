  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1989 more than 1500 people who took the dietary supplement L-tryptophan for insomnia and
      depression developed eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS)-a potentially fatal disease
      characterized by an excess of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils. Disease symptoms
      include fever, muscle aches and inflammation, and skin rashes. As many as 40 of the patients
      who became ill died. It is suspected that impurities in the supplements caused the disease.
      More recently, similar impurities have been detected in batches of a similar dietary
      supplement called L-5-hydroxytryptophan.

      This study is designed to learn more about EMS that develops in patients taking
      L-5-hydroxytryptophan. The study is open to patients newly diagnosed with eosinophilia
      myalgia who have taken L-5-HTP. Patients in the study will have a physical examination and
      urine and blood tests. They may also have X rays, an electrocardiogram, magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), and a skin test for tuberculosis. They will have a psychiatric interview, take
      a memory test, and fill out questionnaires relating to sadness and depression.

      Patients may also undergo special tests to study conduction of nerve impulses and muscle
      function.

      Samples of patients' supplements will be taken for chemical analysis.

    <textblock>
      The L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS), characterized by eosinophilia,
      myalgias, myositis, scleroderma-like skin fibrosis and fasciitis, occurred in 1989 in over
      1500 patients who had ingested L-tryptophan for sleep disturbances and depression. The
      identical clinical syndrome has also occurred in subjects ingesting L-5-hydroxytryptophan
      (L-5-HTP).

      Recently, a letter to Nature Medicine reported the presence of an impurity in 6 out of 6
      samples of L-5-HTP obtained randomly at health food stores. This impurity appears to be the
      same as the one identified in material ingested by a family (mother and 2 babies) who had
      developed an EMS-like syndrome after ingesting L-5-HTP.

      Although there have been no definite new cases of L-5-HTP-related EMS, the FDA is currently
      investigating unconfirmed reports of possible new cases.

        Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

        Patients newly diagnosed with eosinophilia and myalgia, and who ingested L-5-HTP.

        Subjects will be defined as having 5-L-HTP related EMS according to the diagnostic criteria
        originally established by the CDC for diagnosis of L-tyrptophan-related EMS.
