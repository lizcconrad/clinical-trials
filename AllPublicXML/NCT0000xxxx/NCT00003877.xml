      RATIONALE: Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether Stromagen improves the
      success of stem cell transplantation in women with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of Stromagen during stem cell
      transplantation following chemotherapy in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of expanded mesenchymal stem cells (Stromagen) infusion
      and autologous CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells transplantation after high dose chemotherapy
      in women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Compare the time to neutrophil and platelet
      engraftment in patients receiving different doses of Stromagen. III. Evaluate the immune
      reconstitution of these patients after this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, blinded study. Patients are randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment arms. All patients undergo mobilization of peripheral
      blood stem cells (PBSC) using cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      on day 1, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 4 and continuing until
      completion of leukapheresis. PBSC and bone marrow cells are collected and CD34 positive cells
      are then selected. About 4 weeks later, patients receive high dose chemotherapy.
      Cyclophosphamide IV over 24 hours, carboplatin IV over 24 hours, and thiotepa IV over 24
      hours are administered on days -7 to -4. Patients then receive placebo or one of two doses of
      expanded mesenchymal stem cells (Stromagen) IV on day -1 and CD34+ selected PBSC IV over 2
      hours on day 0. Patients are followed at 6 weeks and 12 weeks, than at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
