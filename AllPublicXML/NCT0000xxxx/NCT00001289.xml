  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from glycocerebroside accumulation
      in macrophages due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It may occur in
      adults but occurs most severely in infants, in whom cerebroside also accumulates in neurons.
      Patients with Gaucher's disease experience enlargement of the liver and spleen and bone
      destruction. The condition is passed from generation to generation through autosomal
      recessive inheritance. There are actually three types of Gaucher's disease.

      Type I is the most common form. It is a chronic non-neuronopathic form, meaning the disease
      does not affect nerve cells. The symptoms of type I can appear at any age.

      Type II appears in infancy and usually results in death for the patient. Type II is an acute
      neuronopathic form and can affect the brain stem. It is the most severe form of the disease.

      Type III is also neuronopathic, however it is subacute in nature. This means the course of
      the illness lies somewhere between long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of enzyme replacement therapy on patients
      with Gaucher's disease, specifically those types directly affecting the nervous system
      (neuronopathic).

      Patients with Gaucher's disease types II and III will be selected to participate in the study
      and receive enzyme replacement therapy. Patients participating will undergo a variety of
      tests to measure levels of hemoglobin concentration, liver volume, and spleen volume.
      Improvements in these measures will be compared other laboratory tests measuring the
      involvement of the nervous system.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of enzyme replacement therapy in patients
      with neuronopathic Gaucher's disease and to investigate the pathogenesis of their
      neurological signs and symptoms. Macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase will be administered
      by intravenous infusion under the supervision of the patient's private physician at an
      initial dosage of 60 to 120 IU per kg of body weight weekly or every other week. Patients
      will be categorized as treatment responders if they display a clinically significant increase
      in hemoglobin concentration and a reduction in hepatic or splenic volume. Improvement in
      these parameters over time will be correlated with measurements for metabolic encephalopathy
      and radiologic, electrophysiologic and psychometric measurements of neurological involvement.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. All patients with neuropathic Gaucher's disease who have a partial or complete
                  horizontal supranuclear gaze palsy or a genotype associated with neurological
                  involvement.

               2. All candidates must be serologically nonreactive for hepatitis B and human
                  immunodeficiency (AIDS) virus. HIV positive patients will be excluded because of
                  the effects of the latter illness on cognitive performance.

               3. Individuals with neoplastic disease will be excluded.

               4. The general health and well being of each candidate must be sufficient to allow
                  for a modest amount of blood drawing, collection of appropriate urine and spinal
                  fluid specimens and performance of necessary roentgenographic and magnetic
                  resonance (MR) imaging studies. In addition, each candidate must be able to
                  return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on a regular basis dictated by
                  disease severity for monitoring of laboratory parameters.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patient who participates in a clinical study of an investigational therapeutic agent
             for Gaucher Disease.

          2. Patient and/or the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are unable to understand
             the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.

          3. Patient is unable to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative with protocol
             schedule, refusal to agree to all of the study procedures.
