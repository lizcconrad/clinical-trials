  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Phase II trial to
      study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have stage III, stage IV, or
      recurrent endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OOBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of trastuzumab (Herceptin), in terms of response, in
      patients with advanced, recurrent, or persistent endometrial adenocarcinoma that demonstrates
      HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the effects of prognostic factors (i.e., initial performance status and
      histological grade) in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 years.
