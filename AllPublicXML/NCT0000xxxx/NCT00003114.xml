      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with
      lomustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and procarbazine in treating patients with stage IIB,
      stage III, or stage IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival of patients
           receiving lomustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide/procarbazine (CECP) for stage IIB-IV
           AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease.

        -  Assess the feasibility and toxic effects of CECP in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral etoposide on days 1-3, and oral
      cyclophosphamide and procarbazine on days 22-31. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42. The course is repeated every 6 weeks.

      Patients with a complete or partial response after 1 course of treatment receive two
      additional courses, but lomustine is omitted in the second course. Patients with partial
      response or stable disease receive radiation therapy and/or continued chemotherapy. Patients
      failing to respond after 1 course are removed from the study.

      Patients will be followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 16 evaluable patients will be accrued.
