    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the effects of hormone replacement therapy on memory, mental
      abilities and mood in older adults aged 65-90. During the nine month long study, men will
      take testosterone for three months and women will take estrogen for three months. At four
      points during the study (once every three months), participants will complete a test battery
      and have blood drawn.

      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigating the effects of estrogen
      replacement and testosterone replacement on cognition and mood in older adults. Women who
      have not had a hysterectomy will be given Prempro (estrogen with progesterone to protect the
      uterine lining), and hysterectomized women will be given Premarin (estrogen only).
