  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerance of low-dose versus high-dose cysteamine administered
      concurrently with zidovudine (AZT). To determine the pharmacokinetics and effects on immune
      function and viral load in patients receiving these drug regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive high or low doses of cysteamine plus AZT or placebo plus AZT. The target
      dose of cysteamine is determined by titration of the dose over a 6-week period, after which
      the patient receives 24 additional weeks of treatment. An initial cohort of 36 patients will
      be enrolled in a 10-week pilot phase. Accrual will be temporarily suspended while data from
      the pilot phase is assessed.
