      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to receive either oral 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA) or placebo twice a day for 12
      weeks. After 12 weeks patients who improved with 4-ASA and those who received placebo are
      given the option of receiving 4-ASA for an additional year.

      Patients who were randomized to receive 4-ASA and continue treatment after 12 weeks are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year. Patients who were randomized to receive placebo and begin
      4-ASA therapy after 12 weeks are followed monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months for 1
      year.
