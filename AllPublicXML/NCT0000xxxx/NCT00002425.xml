      To evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of saquinavir soft gelatin capsule
      formulation (SQV-SGC) in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.

    <textblock>
      All patients receive SQV as monotherapy or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs
      chosen by the investigator and patient. (This study provides only SQV.) Patients may not
      choose another protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their combination therapy; furthermore,
      patients taking PIs other than SQV must undergo a 5-day washout period before study-drug
      administration. Patients are monitored for adverse events and changes in routine laboratory
      tests, plasma viral load, and CD4+ T cell levels. Outcomes are analyzed by stratifying
      patients according to CD4+ T cell levels and prior history with protease inhibitors.
