  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to measure changes in blood flow
      to areas in the brain as individuals perform intellectual tasks.

      This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine blood flow to
      areas of the brain as participants engage in tasks associated with visual perception, visual
      recognition, and memory.

      Objective:

      Our goal is to study the functional organization of the intact human brain by combining
      cognitive tasks and neuroimaging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to measure brain
      activity in healthy human subjects engaged in performing cognitive tasks. These tasks will
      address specific questions concerning the neural systems that mediate perception, attention,
      memory, decision-making, emotion, plasticity and social interactions. fMRI and MEG,
      respectively, will be employed to investigate the spatial and temporal aspects of these
      neural systems.

      Study Population:

      Normal volunteer participants aged 18-65, who are in good general health will be recruited
      from the local community and studied under this minimal risk protocol.

      Design:

      Subjects will perform cognitive tasks in behavioral and/or neuroimaging sessions (fMRI or
      MEG).

      Outcome Measures:

      Behavior as performance on cognitive tasks, and brain activity (fMRI and MEG) will be
      combined to yield information about the neural correlates and processes underlying different
      aspects of human cognition including visual perception, memory, learning, emotion, social
      cognition, decision-making and attention.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy adults, with at least a high school education, aged 18 to 65 years, will be
        recruited to participate in the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded if they:

          -  are an NIMH employee or a relative

          -  have evidence of, or a history of:

          -  major medical, neurological or psychiatric illness

          -  serious head injury

          -  learning disability-drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in the past 3 months, except
             nicotine

        -are taking prescription drugs or supplements that may affect brain function-

        -have serious vision or hearing problems

        In addition to the above, additional exclusion criteria apply for all MRI studies:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or have a positive pregnancy test 24 hours prior to
             an experiment will be excluded from neuroimaging studies.

          -  All subjects will be questioned prior to MRI scanning for possible occupational
             exposure to metal slivers or shavings, which may have become accidentally lodged in
             the tissues of the head or neck. Subjects with surgical clips or shrapnel in or near
             the brain or blood vessels, subjects with cochlear implants, subjects with any
             metallic body in the eye or CNS, and subjects with any form of implant wire or metal
             device which may concentrate radiofrequency fields will be excluded from MRI scanning
             experiments because of possible risks during MRI scanning. Those whose history is
             suggestive of such a problem will also be excluded from the MRI portion of the
             experiments. They may still participate in the behavioral and MEG experiments.

          -  Subjects unable to lie flat on their back for up to 2 hours may not be eligible to
             participate in MRI scans.
