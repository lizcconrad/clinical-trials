      RATIONALE: Using new methods to examine sputum samples for the presence of cancer cells may
      detect lung cancer earlier.

      PURPOSE: Screening trial to study the effectiveness of new methods of examining sputum
      samples to detect second primary lung cancer in patients with resected stage I non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether immunostaining of induced sputum specimens improves the
      sensitivity and specificity of routine morphologic sputum surveillance to detect second
      primary lung cancer in patients with previously resected nonsmall cell lung cancer. II.
      Evaluate which patients are at risk of developing a second primary lung cancer by
      immunostaining specimens from patients with no morphologic atypia on routine Papanicolaou
      cytology. III. Make available archived sputum samples and bronchial washings for further
      analysis of new antibodies and techniques. IV. Evaluate whether analysis of elevations of
      relevant growth factors in bronchial lavage fluid from patients with positive immunostaining
      or morphologic atypia increases the accuracy of early detection. V. Evaluate whether
      quantitation of shed antigens in sputum increases the accuracy of early detection. VI.
      Evaluate whether the extent of airway obstruction, as measured by the forced expiratory
      volume, can predict an increased risk of developing lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Screening for Second Primary Lung Cancer. Annual sputum induction for Papanicolaou
      cytology and immunostaining (using monoclonal antibodies 624H12 and 703D4), with optional
      pulmonary function tests and fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchial washings.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,100 patients will be entered over 3 years. The sample size will be
      adjusted based on the rate of positive staining in the first 100 patients. Patients followed
      at uncertified centers are analyzed separately.
