  <brief_summary>

      To determine whether methadone maintenance alters the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT).
      To determine whether any such effect of methadone on disposition of AZT is time dependent and
      whether a metabolic interaction between AZT and methadone exists.

      Injection drug users represent an increasing proportion of HIV-infected persons. Since daily
      methadone maintenance is the major chemical treatment for injection drug abuse, it is
      important to determine the impact of methadone on AZT absorption, distribution, and
      elimination.

      Injection drug users represent an increasing proportion of HIV-infected persons. Since daily
      methadone maintenance is the major chemical treatment for injection drug abuse, it is
      important to determine the impact of methadone on AZT absorption, distribution, and
      elimination.

      After 6 days of inpatient detoxification with clonidine, patients addicted to opiates are
      randomized to receive either oral or intravenous AZT for the first dose, followed by
      determination of plasma and urine pharmacokinetics. On the second day of AZT dosing, the
      alternate form of administration will be used for the first dose. On both days, all other
      doses are given orally. Patients then begin methadone maintenance in combination with AZT for
      7 days of inpatient treatment, with further pharmacokinetic sampling. After hospitalization
      for 16 days total, patients continue AZT/methadone treatment on an outpatient basis, and then
      2 months later are readmitted as inpatients for 5 days for further pharmacokinetic sampling.
      Control patients who are not addicted to opiates are hospitalized for 3 days at study entry
      and are randomized for AZT treatment and pharmacokinetic sampling in the same manner as the
      first group, although they will not receive methadone treatment. Control patients are
      readmitted for 2 days after 1 week of AZT treatment and then again after 59 days of AZT
      treatment.
