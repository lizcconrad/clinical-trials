      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of different regimens of PSA
      vaccines in treating patients who have advanced prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effect of prime and boost strategies using recombinant fowlpox
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) vaccine and recombinant vaccinia PSA vaccine on biochemical
      PSA progression in patients with stage D0 prostate cancer who have completed local treatment.
      II. Assess the tolerability and toxicity of these prime and boost treatment regimens in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the effects of these prime and boost treatment regimens on cellular
      immunity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to HLA-2 typing
      (positive vs negative vs unknown). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive intramuscular fowlpox prostate specific antigen (PSA) vaccine at
      weeks 0, 6, 12, and 18. Arm II: Patients receive intramuscular fowlpox PSA vaccine at weeks
      0, 6, and 12 and intradermal vaccinia PSA vaccine at week 18. Arm III: Patients receive
      intradermal vaccinia PSA vaccine at week 0 and intramuscular fowlpox PSA vaccine at weeks 6,
      12, and 18. Patients are followed at week 24, then every 3 months until year 2, every 6
      months until year 5, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
