      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate of combined cisplatin and irinotecan in patients
      with metastatic or locally advanced (inoperable or recurrent) esophageal or gastric cancer.
      II. Evaluate the toxic effects both qualitatively and quantitatively of cisplatin and
      irinotecan in these patients. III. Estimate the disease free and overall survival of these
      patients. IV. Assess whether the response proportion differs between squamous cell and
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. V. Evaluate quality of life issues using the Memorial
      Symptom Assessment Scale, the FACT-G questionnaire, and the dysphagia scale.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin and irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for 4 weeks,
      followed by a 2 week rest period. Each treatment course lasts 6 weeks. Patients receive at
      least 3 courses of therapy if the treatment is well tolerated and no disease progression is
      documented. Patients attaining a complete response receive additional courses of therapy at
      the discretion of the investigator. Tumor status is reassessed at 6 weeks and every 12 weeks
      thereafter. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients will be accrued within 12-18 months. Accrual for
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is complete.
