      The purpose of this study is to see if an HIV-education course can help under-represented,
      HIV-infected patients. This study examines the areas of faithfulness to drug regimen, level
      of HIV in the blood, and health status.

      Following initial screening, eligible patients are treated with open-label Combivir plus
      abacavir for 24 weeks. Patients are randomized to undergo the education intervention, Tools
      for Health and Empowerment (T.H.E.) course plus counseling, or routine counseling only
      (control group). Measurements and evaluations for assessment of immunologic effects,
      adherence, and health outcomes are performed at entry (Day 1) and at Weeks 2, 5, 8, 12, 16,
      and 24.
