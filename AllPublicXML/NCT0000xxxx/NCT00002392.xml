      To ascertain the effect of thalidomide on immune responses to vaccination with polyvalent
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and tetanus toxoid in HIV-infected patients;
      particularly, on markers of immune activation and parameters of specific, anti-HIV cellular
      immunity.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide in a blinded, placebo-controlled study. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      11/25/98: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which thalidomide or placebo is
      administered for 21 days. After the first week of therapy, patients receive immunizations
      with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. Study therapy is stopped
      for 2 weeks after the immunizations. Following the immunizations, detailed evaluations of the
      immune responses to the vaccines are conducted over the next 8 weeks.]
