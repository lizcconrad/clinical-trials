      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating women who have
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or
           metastatic breast cancer following failure of anthracycline/taxane based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in these
           patients when treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
