      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is most effective in treating advanced
      stomach cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TCF)
           versus docetaxel and cisplatin (TC) versus epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (ECF)
           in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.

        -  Compare the time to treatment failure, time to progression, and survival in this patient
           population treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life during the treatment period and after failure in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, performance status (0 vs 1), and liver involvement (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of three treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV bolus and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 plus
           fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day
           1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel and cisplatin as in arm II and fluorouracil as in
           arm I.

      Treatment regimen is repeated every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before randomization; at day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6; and one
      month after treatment failure.

      Patients with complete response or partial response are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 111 patients will be accrued for this study.
