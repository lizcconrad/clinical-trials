  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether estrogen administration in postmenopausal women can alter the
      response to changes in brain chemistry brought about by dietary manipulation. Women who are
      recently menopausal (50-60 yrs. of age) and over 20 years postmenopausal (&gt;70 yrs. of age)
      will take estrogen or placebo for three months. At the end of that time they will participate
      in three challenges using dietary techniques to briefly change the relative amounts of
      neurotransmitters in the brain that are believed to be related to mood regulation (serotonin,
      dopamine, and norepinephrine). Previous research has shown that these dietary manipulations
      can briefly produce negative changes in mood. The investigator hypothesizes that estrogen
      administration will blunt or buffer these negative effects in a quantifiable way. The
      investigator believes that this will provide a direct test of the ability of estrogen to
      meaningfully change the brain chemistry of mood in a clinically measurable and positive way.
      The proposed procedure will also allow assessment of the effects of estrogen on brain
      neurotransmitter systems after many years of very low estrogen levels.
