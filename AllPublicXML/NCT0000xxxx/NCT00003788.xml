      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known if the addition of photodynamic therapy to
      combined therapy with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is more effective than
      combined therapy alone for supratentorial gliomas.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of surgery, radiation therapy,
      and chemotherapy with or without photodynamic therapy in treating patients who have newly
      diagnosed or recurrent malignant supratentorial gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the addition of photodynamic therapy to standard brain tumor care
           (surgical resection, postoperative radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) will result in a
           significant prolongation of time to recurrence and survival in newly diagnosed malignant
           supratentorial gliomas.

        -  Compare the effect of high or low light dose photodynamic therapy on survival of
           patients with recurrent malignant supratentorial gliomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter, two part study. Patients are stratified according
      to clinical center.

      Newly diagnosed patients (Study 1)

        -  Patients are randomized to receive either high light dose photodynamic therapy (arm I)
           or no photodynamic therapy (arm II):

             -  Arm I: Patients receive porfimer sodium (Photofrin) IV one day prior to surgery.
                Craniotomy and tumor resection are performed. Upon completion of resection,
                patients undergo intracavitary photoillumination with a high light dose.

             -  Arm II: Craniotomy and tumor resection are performed. Postoperatively, all patients
                receive external beam radiotherapy 5 days per week for 5-6 weeks. After completing
                radiotherapy, patients receive nitrosourea (carmustine or lomustine) chemotherapy.

      Recurrent tumor patients (Study 2)

        -  Patients receive Photofrin IV one day prior to surgery. Craniotomy and tumor resection
           are performed.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive high dose light therapy during surgery.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive low dose light therapy during surgery. Patients receive
                chemotherapy with procarbazine for 28 days beginning 2-4 weeks after surgery.
                Courses repeat every 56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity.

      Patients are followed on both studies at 4 weeks postsurgery, then every 3 months until death
      or for 1 year after study closure.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 150 patients with newly diagnosed tumor will be accrued for
      this study within 4 years (Study 1). A maximum of 120 patients with recurrent disease will be
      accrued within 4.5 years (Study 2)
