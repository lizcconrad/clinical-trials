      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with
      early-stage bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate toxicity and safety of intravesical paclitaxel in patients with
      superficial bladder cancer. II. Evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel against transitional cell
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) and/or unresectable papillary superficial bladder cancer. III.
      Evaluate a dose-response effect and choose an appropriate dose for further clinical study.

      OUTLINE: Cohorts of patients receive intravesical paclitaxel in escalating doses,
      administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, then once every 2 weeks for another 6 weeks, for a
      maximum of 2 courses at a dose level. Patients must complete 8 of the first 15 instillations
      and a 3 month cystoscopic exam with biopsy and cytology to be deemed evaluable. Participants
      are followed by quarterly cytoscopy and cytology for an additional 21 month period. Biopsies
      are performed at 3 and/or 6 months, and thereafter if clinically applicable.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 19 evaluable patients will be enrolled.
