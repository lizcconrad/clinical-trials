  <brief_summary>

      To determine the safety of stem cell harvesting after administration of filgrastim ( G-CSF )
      to mobilize bone marrow stem cells into the peripheral blood in patients at various stages of
      HIV-1 infection as well as in HIV-negative volunteers. To determine the surface phenotypic
      and functional characteristics as well as the viral load in the stem cells obtained following
      this procedure.

      Patients and volunteers receive seven daily subcutaneous injections of G-CSF. On days 5 and 6
      of drug administration, patients have peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested by
      leukapheresis. HIV-positive patients are stratified into three cohorts based on CD4 count and
      presence of symptoms. If no increase in number of harvested stem cells and no grade 4 bone
      pain toxicity occur in two of the first three patients in a cohort, then the last three
      patients in that cohort will receive a dose escalation. Patients are followed for 24 weeks.
