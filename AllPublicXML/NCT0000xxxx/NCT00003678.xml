      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of at least 2 years of
      tamoxifen with that of 5 additional years of tamoxifen in treating women who have breast
      cancer that has been surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival of women with early breast cancer who are
           randomized to discontinue adjuvant tamoxifen vs those randomized to continue for at
           least 5 additional years.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified for analysis according to
      duration of tamoxifen given before randomization (2-3 years vs 4-5 years vs 6-7 years vs 8-9
      years vs 10 years and over), age (less than 49 vs over 50), and important prognostic factors,
      including tumor type and grade and nodal and estrogen receptor status. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients discontinue tamoxifen after at least 2 years of prior treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients continue treatment with tamoxifen for at least 5 additional years in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8,000-20,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
