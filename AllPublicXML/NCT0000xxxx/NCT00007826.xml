      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from cancer
      cells may make the body build an immune response to kill colorectal tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy and/or
      vaccine therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotypic
           vaccine and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.

        -  Determine any immunological response to these treatment regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the 6-month and 1-year survival of these patients after receiving these
           treatment regimens.

        -  Determine the tumor response to these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are assigned to one of three treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotype vaccine (MOAB 105AD7)
           plus BCG intradermally (ID) weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7 ID plus alum adjuvant
           intramuscularly (IM) weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 ID alone monthly for
           up to 12 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based
           vaccines plus BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; these vaccines ID weekly for weeks 4 and
           6, and then monthly for up to 12 months.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive MOAB 105AD7, ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic
           adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines, and BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7 and
           ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines ID plus alum
           adjuvant IM weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and
           ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines monthly for up to 12 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (15 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
