      The purpose of this study is to see how patients with incurable salivary gland cancer, who
      have not had chemotherapy before, respond to Gemcitabine. The investigators are trying to
      find out what effects (good and bad) Gemcitabine has on participants and salivary gland
      cancer.

      Gemcitabine has been shown to be an effective chemotherapy agent in other types of cancer,
      including; bladder cancer, breast cancer, certain types of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and
      pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine has yet to be studied for efficacy in subjects with salivary
      gland cancer and in general other chemotherapy drugs have shown to be ineffective so far in
      this population.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the response rate of patients with incurable salivary gland cancer treated with
           gemcitabine.

        -  Evaluate the time to progression and toxicity of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV for 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day course.
      Patients receive a minimum of 2 courses of treatment. Patients may continue treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following malignancies originating from salivary
             tissue: adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma,
             malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients must be incurable on the basis of unresectable local or distant disease as
             determined by the patient's surgeon and not be potentially curable by radiation
             therapy as determined by a radiation oncologist.

          -  Patients may have received radiation to any site with the following caveat: the sites
             used for evaluation for response are either not previously irradiated or they have
             shown progression of disease post radiation and there has been a time interval of one
             month since these sites were radiated.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of less than 3.

          -  Patients must have at least uni-dimensionally measurable disease documented within one
             month of initiation of treatment. Measurement may be by physical exam or
             radiologically.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to go through the process of informed consent.

          -  Patients must not receive any form (including radiotherapeutic, immunologic, hormonal,
