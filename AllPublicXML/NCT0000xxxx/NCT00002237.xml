  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest amount of peldesine that is safe. This
      study will also see if this amount of peldesine is effective in lowering HIV levels in the
      blood.

      Patients are given either BCX-35 or placebo for 14 or 28 days. Plasma viral load will be
      determined at the MTD.
