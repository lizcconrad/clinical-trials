  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination anti-HIV drug treatment regimen of
      indinavir plus lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in treating HIV and in
      reducing the chances of passing HIV from mother to child. This study will also examine if
      this combination is well tolerated by HIV-positive pregnant women and if a combination of 3TC
      plus ZDV is safe for newborns.

      Previous studies in adults and children have shown that indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV can
      reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take ZDV to
      treat HIV and to reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. The combination of drugs
      in this study may be more effective than ZDV alone.

      Despite the dramatic reduction of perinatal HIV transmission following the administration of
      ZDV to mothers and infants, new, more effective strategies are needed. An increasing number
      of women may require combination antiretroviral therapy for their own disease because they
      may be resistant to ZDV, may have high viral loads, or may have previously transmitted HIV to
      an infant while on ZDV monotherapy. The initiation of triple combination therapy, including a
      protease inhibitor indinavir, during gestation may be the most effective in reducing maternal
      virus load prior to delivery, thereby potentially benefitting both mother and child.

      Women:

      Antepartum (until active labor): Indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV. Intrapartum (active labor until
      cord clamping): 3TC plus ZDV. Postpartum (after cord clamped to 12 weeks): Indinavir plus 3TC
      plus ZDV.

      Infants:

      3TC plus ZDV as soon as oral intake is tolerated (preferably within 12 hours of birth) and
      continuing for 6 weeks.

      [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/27/99: For maternal dosing, one Combivir tablet bid can be substituted
      for the individual formulation of 3TC and ZDV. For mothers who receive Combivir during the
      antepartum period, Combivir is held during labor and delivery, and the separate formulations
      of ZDV and 3TC are used. Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment should continue
      to be followed on study for the duration of the study.]
