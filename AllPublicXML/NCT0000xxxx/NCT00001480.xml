      The purpose of this study is to evaluate people with mild memory problems, those with
      dementia, those at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy volunteers to
      identify markers of AD before the changes that occur with the disease begin.

      The origin and markers of progression for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are relatively obscure.
      Despite increased understanding of the underlying biology of AD, its clinical diagnosis is
      still made only after progressive cognitive decline; definitive diagnosis is confirmed at
      autopsy. This study will examine biomarker changes over time in a distinct cohort of people
      with an increased risk of developing AD. The study will also identify and track biological
      changes that occur with progressive dementia and compare those changes to the known cognitive
      and emotional disturbances that characterize AD.

      Individuals with a first-degree relative with AD will be recruited into an at-risk cohort.
      They will be followed and compared to a group of healthy volunteers for a minimum of 8 years.

      The temporal origin of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and markers of progression of this disease
      process are relatively obscure. Despite outstanding advances in the understanding of the
      underlying biology of AD, the clinical diagnosis is still made by consensus following
      progressive cognitive deterioration and confirmed only at autopsy. The protocol will serve
      two functions. First, we will evaluate and longitudinally follow a cohort of first-degree
      relatives of AD subjects who are currently normal but are at increased risk of developing AD
      sometime in the future. This cohort will be compared to a group of normal controls along
      multiple behavioral, cognitive, motor function, genetic and biologic parameters over a period
      of years. While differential rates of conversion to AD might eventually be expected based on
      family history and other fixed variables (i.e., APO E status), this study is not powered to
      simply be a study of conversion to AD. Rather, it is a study of biomarker change over time in
      a distinct cohort of people with increased risk of developing AD. Conversion to a clinical
      diagnosis of AD is only one of the variables; others will include cognitive testing,
      neuroimaging, genetic markers, assessment of functional capacities and cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) measures that may ultimately function as disease surrogates. As part of this at risk
      cohort, we will recruit and longitudinally follow a series of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic
      subjects with known genetic mutations (presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or APP). Second, we will
      follow a large cohort of dementia subjects themselves for whom the diagnosis is either AD or
      some other related dementia. The purpose of this second part of the follow-up study is to
      identify and track those biologic changes that occur with progressive illness and,
      furthermore, to relate those changes to the known cognitive and emotional disturbances which
      characterize AD.

      By longitudinally following separate cohorts of normal controls without a family history of
      AD, normal controls with a family history of AD, subjects with mild cognitive impairments and
      diagnosed dementia subjects, we hope to track the spectrum of AD from its clinical and
      biologic origins. As a result, this study is both a diagnostic screening protocol and a
      natural history protocol. It will address a series of important clinical and biological
      questions among a wide range of normal and diseased individuals and should serve as a basis
      for the development of biologic markers in AD that could be used for diagnostic and
      therapeutic purposes in the future. A long-term goal of this protocol to identify markers and
      eventually individual people who are at increased risk of developing AD before the typical
      cognitive changes of AD become manifest. In pursuit of that goal, we will also carefully
      monitor and evaluate the clinical medications taken by our subjects to see if they influence
      the course of AD.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        DEMENTIA PATIENTS:

        Dementia of the Alzheimer type will be defined by a gradual onset with a continuing
        cognitive decline not due to other central nervous system conditions that cause progressive
        deficits in memory. The cognitive decline must include a memory impairment but must also be
        accompanied by at least one other cognitive disturbance such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia,
        or a disturbance in executive functioning. The deficits must cause significant impairments
        in social or occupational performance and represent a decline in function.

        Longitudinal subjects will be excluded from specific aspects of the study if they have
        contraindications to any of the procedures involved as specified in the Hazards and
        Precautions section. Furthermore, subjects will be excluded if they are not able or willing
        to assign durable power of attorney (DPA) to an appropriate person.

        MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI):

        Is defined operationally as evidence of cognitive difficulty, including memory problems
        which are significant to generate a worry for the individual or surrounding family members
        but not yet sufficient to elicit the diagnosis of possible Alzheimer's disease when
        evaluated by a physician. As in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, these subjects
        will have a memory complaint and at least one abnormal memory function, but they will still
        fall within normal limits globally.

        AT RISK INDIVIDUALS:

        At risk individuals will be defined by one of the following criteria: (a) having a
        presumptive diagnosis of AD in one or more of their first-degree relatives; or (b)
        belonging to a family with a known or presumed genetic mutation for AD; and (c) testing
        within the normal range on a battery of cognitive tests at the time of baseline evaluation.

        NORMAL CONTROLS:

        They will not have a positive family history of dementia in their first-degree relatives,
        and they will test within the normal range on the battery of cognitive tests listed
        previously.
