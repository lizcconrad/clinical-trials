    <textblock>
      Some of the thinking difficulties of Alzheimer's patients may be due to a deficiency in a
      brain chemical called acetylcholine, which helps transmit messages between nerve cells.
      Nefiracetam is a new drug that stimulates acetylcholine. This study will test whether
      Nefiracetam can safely improve memory, thinking and activities of daily living in patients
      with mild to moderate intellectual impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

      Patients in the study must have a caregiver and designated representative. Candidates will be
      given a medical history and physical examination that includes a complete neurologic and
      neuropsychologic evaluation, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram. A chest X ray and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test will be done on patients who have not had these tests
      within the previous two years. During the 20-week study, each patient will take three pills
      twice a day for twenty weeks of either Nefiracetame or placebo (sugar pill). Neither the
      patients nor the doctors will know which patients are getting the drug and which are getting
      the placebo. Blood and urine tests will be done frequently throughout the study. Patients
      will be asked to have a spinal tap (on a voluntary basis) to measure the levels of drug in
      the spinal fluid, and a PET scan (a brain imaging test).

      At the end of the study, patients who feel they are doing well with no side effects from the
      drug (or placebo) may be given the option of continuing treatment for another seven months.

      Animal studies showed that Nefiracetam improved learning impairment and memory in rats with
      dementia. In a small study of humans, about one-fourth of patients who were given a low dose
      of the drug had improved intellectual function, and about one-half who received a higher dose
      improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diminished cholinergic function has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer
      type dementia. Studies in animal models of this disorder as well as in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that drugs capable of activating central cholinergic
      transmission can improve cognitive function. Nevertheless, no currently available drug of
      this or any other type consistently confers clinically significant benefit. To further
      evaluate the cholinergic hypothesis for symptom palliation with a mechanistically novel
      pharmacologic tool, the acute safety and antidementia efficacy of nefiracetam will be studied
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design. In contrast to the
      currently available cholinesterase inhibitors, nefiracetam enhances the activity of nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors by interacting with a protein kinase C pathway and accelerates
      acetylcholine turnover and release. Efficacy in patients with mild to moderate dementia will
      be assessed through application of standardized neuropsychological test instruments in this
      first double-blind, randomized controlled trial of nefiracetam in AD. Safety will be
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

        Study subjects will satisfy NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Dementia severity will
        be in the mild to moderate range, as evidenced by a Mini-Mental State Examination total
        score of 12-25 which is roughly equivalent to Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale
        Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) scores of 30 to 11, will include deficits in at least 2 areas of
        cognition, will have been present at least 1 year, and will have progressed gradually since
        onset. Patients must be between the ages of 50-90 with onset of dementia after age 40. The
        modified Hachinski Ischemia Score must be less than 4 and the brain MRI within 2 years of
        enrollment must be consistent with the diagnosis of AD.

        Patients must have had a brain MRI since the onset of dementia symptoms that is consistent
        with the diagnosis of AD.

        Patients must have an acceptable nutritional status (i.e., body weight within 20% of
        desirable weight for height).

        Patients must be surgically sterile.

        Patients must be post-menopausal or practicing adequate contraception.

        Physical and laboratory exams must be normal, or the abnormalities must be attributed to
        the dementing illness or judged clinically unimportant to the safe conduct of this trial.
