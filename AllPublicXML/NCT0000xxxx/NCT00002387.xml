  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the differences in parameters of antiviral activity and safety between a control
      regimen of indinavir in combination with DMP 266 and an experimental regimen of higher-dose
      indinavir in combination with lower-dose DMP 266 after sixteen weeks of dosing, in protease
      inhibitor- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-naive, HIV-1 seropositive
      patients.

      It is hypothesized that after 16 weeks of randomized treatment with either the control or
      experimental regimen that:

        1. The observed proportion of patients with serum viral RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml in the
           experimental and control regimen will be similar and will continue to be so after 48
           weeks.

        2. The safety profiles of the two groups will be similar, judged by the incidence of
           serious, drug-related adverse experiences and the incidence of events of specific
           interest (e.g., nephrolithiasis, hyperbilirubinemia, nausea/vomiting, rash, and
           CNS-related symptoms) and will continue to be so after 48 weeks.

        3. The two groups will be similar with respect to changes from baseline in serum viral RNA
           and CD4 counts and will continue to be so after 48 weeks.

           and CD4 counts and will continue to be so after 48 weeks.

      Patients are randomized to one of two regimens: a control regimen of indinavir plus DMP 266
      or an experimental regimen of indinavir plus DMP 266, each at different doses than in the
      control regimen.
