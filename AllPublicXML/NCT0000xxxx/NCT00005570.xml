  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the collection of blood samples from patients with immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to evaluate the relationship between platelet counts, blood
      levels of a hormone called thrombopoietin that controls platelet production by the bone
      marrow, and blood levels of antibodies against thrombopoietin that could interfere with the
      action of this hormone. Blood samples will also be stored if separately agreed to by the
      patient for analysis of genes that might affect platelet production. At a single outpatient
      clinic visit, patients will have a medical history taken, and blood samples drawn for
      testing. Results from this study may help further understand the control of platelet
      production in patients with ITP, and suggest new therapeutic approaches.

        Diagnosis of ITP, based on the history, physical examination, complete blood count, and
        examination of the peripheral smear, which should exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia.
        These criteria for ITP are based on the American Society of Hematology practice guideline
        for ITP.

        Subjects 5 years of age or older.

        Before the study specific procedure, the subject or legally acceptable representative must
        give written informed consent(s) for participation in the study.

        No subjects with documented history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Hepatitis.

        No subjects with known underlying causes of thrombocytopenia such as lupus erythematosus,
        autoimmune thyroid disorders, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, bone marrow disorders, and
        liver disease.

        No psychiatric or addictive disorders that compromise the subject's ability to give truly
        informed consent for participation in the study.
