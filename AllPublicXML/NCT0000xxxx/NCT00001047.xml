  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and efficacy of two doses of clarithromycin in combination with
      ethambutol and either rifabutin or clofazimine for the treatment of disseminated
      Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) disease in AIDS patients.

      Recommendations have been issued for AIDS patients with disseminated MAC to be treated with
      at least two antimycobacterial agents and for every regimen to include a macrolide
      (clarithromycin or azithromycin). However, the optimal treatment for disseminated MAC remains
      unknown.

      Recommendations have been issued for AIDS patients with disseminated MAC to be treated with
      at least two antimycobacterial agents and for every regimen to include a macrolide
      (clarithromycin or azithromycin). However, the optimal treatment for disseminated MAC remains
      unknown.

      Patients are randomized to receive clarithromycin at one of two doses plus ethambutol and
      either rifabutin or clofazimine. Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 4 months and every 4
      months thereafter for a minimum of 1.5 years to a common closing date.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Recommended in patients with CD4 count &lt;= 200 cells/mm3:

          -  Antiretroviral therapy.

          -  PCP prophylaxis.

        Allowed in all patients:

          -  Isoniazid preventive therapy.

          -  Evidence of disseminated MAC infection.

        NOTE:

          -  Pregnant women are permitted to enroll following counseling by their clinician
             regarding the potential negative side effects of the study medications. These drugs

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs.

          -  Other concurrent mycobacterial disease requiring therapy, i.e., disseminated
             nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or active tuberculosis.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Additional medications with antimycobacterial activity (unless patient is failing or
             intolerant of assigned study regimen).

          -  Drugs with potential additive toxicity or with potential interaction with study drugs
             (e.g., fluconazole).
