  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine whether the association between selected hypertensive genes and combined fatal
      coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction in high-risk hypertensives is
      modified by the type of antihypertensive treatment, leading to differential risks of coronary
      heart disease.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study might shed important light on the variation in patient response to antihypertensive
      agents, and improve the ability to pick the right antihypertensive for specific patients.
      GenHAT is an ancillary study to ALLHAT (the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to
      Prevent Heart Attack Trial). ALLHAT recruited 42,515 hypertensives and randomized them to one
      of four antihypertensive agents (lisinopril, chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and doxazosin);
      follow-up will be completed in March, 2002.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      GenHAT, a prospective study ancillary to ALLHAT, will characterize hypertension genetic
      variants and determine their interaction with antihypertensive treatments in relation to
      coronary heart disease (CHD). DNA from frozen clots stored at the ALLHAT Central Laboratory
      will be used to genotype variants of hypertension genes (angiotensinogen -6, angiotensin
      converting enzyme insertion/deletion, angiotensin type- 1 receptor, alpha-adducin, beta2
      adrenergic receptor, lipoprotein lipase, and 10 new hypertension variants expected to be
      discovered during the course of the study). In addition to the primary aim, a number of
      secondary aims will be undertaken to evaluate gene- treatment interactions in relation to
      other endpoints, including all-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure, left ventricular
      hypertrophy, decreased renal function, peripheral arterial disease, and blood pressure
      lowering. Because of the ethnic and gender diversity of ALLHAT, an assessment will be made of
      the effects of these variants on outcomes in key subgroups (age &gt;65 years, women, African
      Americans, Type II diabetics), and whether the gene-treatment interactions in relation to
      outcomes are consistent across subgroups.
