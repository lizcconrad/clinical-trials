  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify genes that affect susceptibility to
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). By identifying genes that increase or decrease the risk
      of OCD, researchers can better understand how the condition develops and ultimately improve
      treatment for people with OCD.

      OCD is a severe, familial condition that affects approximately 2% of the population. The way
      OCD is inherited is not clearly understood, but researchers believe it is complex and
      involves multiple genes. This study will detect and localize genes that increase or decrease
      susceptibility to OCD. The data collected from this study will be combined with data from
      other research studies to determine gene linkage and association.

    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe, heritable condition with a lifetime
      prevalence of about two percent of the population. The mode of inheritance is poorly
      understood but is likely complex, involving multiple loci of small to major effect. Since
      1995, the NIMH-IRP has been active in a multi-center family study of OCD, led by Dr. Gerald
      Nestadt of Johns Hopkins University, which was approved via a competitive NIMH extramural
      application (MH 502140). An expanded consortium of sites (including new sites at Brown and
      Harvard Universities) anticipates adding 300 new affected sib-pair families over the next
      three years. This sample will be used for linkage and association analyses. Data will be
      shared within this consortium of investigators studying OCD, and will eventually be combined
      with data obtained from a second consortium.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Must have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or be a family member (usually a
        parent or sibling) of someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

        Certain disorders are considered part of OCD &quot;spectrum&quot; disorders and often include family
        members with OCD. These include Tourette's Syndrome, other individuals with tics, and
        Trichotillomania (severe hair pulling), and other forms of repetitive behaviors.

        Persons with primary behavioral difficulties who do not fit with the current definitions of
        &quot;OCD and OCD spectrum disorders&quot; may not be eligible. These include compulsive shopping,
        gambling, or compulsive sexual behaviors.
