      To compare the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level falls and remains below
      the limit of quantification by the Roche Amplicor Monitor (400 copies/ml)[AS PER AMENDMENT
      8/4/98: 50 copies/ml] between weeks 0 and 24. To determine the short-term safety and
      tolerability of MKC-442 plus nelfinavir (Viracept) plus dual nucleoside analogs. To determine
      the time to viral failure and time to tolerability failure through Week 48 of therapy.

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled study, patients are allowed to switch at entry to d4T
      plus 3TC or d4T plus ddI based on investigator and patient preference. Patients are
      stratified based on the number of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
      treatments that are changed at entry and on screening HIV-1 RNA (obtained within 30 days of
      entry) as follows: switched 1 NRTI and 10,000-50,000 copies/ml vs switched 1 NRTI and greater
      than 50,000 copies/ml vs switched 2 NRTIs and 10,000-50,000 copies/ml vs switched 2 NRTIs and
      greater than 50,000 copies/ml. Patients are randomized within each of these strata to 1 of
      the following treatment arms:

      Arm 1: MKC-442 placebo plus nelfinavir. Arm 2: MKC-442 plus nelfinavir. Arm 3: MKC-442 plus
      nelfinavir (higher dose). Treatment is administered for 48 weeks. Patients who are considered
      virologic successes at Week 48 may continue to receive MKC-442 at the discretion of the
      investigator.
