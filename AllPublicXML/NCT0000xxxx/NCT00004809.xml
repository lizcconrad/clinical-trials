      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Develop an approach for treating patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
      using gene therapy with autologous hepatocytes transduced with a normal low-density
      lipoprotein receptor gene.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Autologous hepatocytes are obtained from a partial hepatectomy and
      transduced with a recombinant retroviral vector containing the low-density lipoprotein
      receptor gene. The transduced hepatocytes are infused via the inferior mesenteric vein 3 days
      following surgery.

      Traditional therapy is discontinued for 4 weeks prior to protocol therapy and may resume 6
      weeks after the hepatocyte infusion.
