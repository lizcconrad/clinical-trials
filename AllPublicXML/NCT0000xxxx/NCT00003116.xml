      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and
      filgrastim together with peripheral stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor works in
      treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor
           cell infusions obtained from normal histocompatible sibling donors for reconstituting
           bone marrow and immunologic function when given after high-dose
           busulfan/cyclophosphamide in patients with a hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors
           given filgrastim (G-CSF) by determining the hematopoietic progenitor cell content of
           allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell collections.

        -  Determine the incidence of engraftment failures in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5,
      cyclophosphamide IV twice a day on days -4 and -3, and cyclosporine IV over 6 hours on day -1
      and then 10 hours on day 0 for 2 doses (allogeneic only). Allogeneic peripheral blood
      progenitor cells IV are administered on day 0.

      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously twice a day beginning 3 hours after
      completion of cell infusion and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every month for 2 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6
      months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued over a 15 month period.
