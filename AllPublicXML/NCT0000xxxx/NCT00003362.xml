      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides that are found on melanoma cells may make the body
      build an immune response and kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with immune
      adjuvants, such as GM-CSF, Montanide ISA-51, or QS21, may be a more effective treatment for
      advanced melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gp 100-tyrosinase peptide
      vaccine with one of the immune adjuvants GM-CSF, Montanide ISA-51, or QS21 in treating
      patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the immunogenicity of gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine with
      sargramostim (GM-CSF), Montanide ISA-51, or QS21 as adjuvant in patients with advanced
      melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity of this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in
      conjunction with these 3 adjuvants in these patients. III. Evaluate the antitumor effects of
      this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (65 years and
      under vs more than 65 years) and previous systemic chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Arm I (Sargramostim (GM-CSF) as adjuvant): Patients
      receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine administered
      intradermally during weeks 1, 5, and 9. For each vaccination, GM-CSF is administered
      intradermally on days 1-10; the vaccine is administered on day 7. Arm II (Montanide ISA-51):
      Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine mixed with
      Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously (SQ) during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Arm III (QS21
      as adjuvant): Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine
      mixed with QS21 and administered SQ during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Patients with stable or
      responding disease may receive 3 additional monthly immunizations beginning 3-6 months
      following completion of 1 course of immunizations if there is evidence of T cell response
      against either wild type peptide. Patients are followed at weeks 13 and 17.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
