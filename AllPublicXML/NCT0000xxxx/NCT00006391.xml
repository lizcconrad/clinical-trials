      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with topotecan in
      treating patients who have previously treated ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of oxaliplatin and
           topotecan in patients with previously treated ovarian epithelial cancer, primary
           peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the correlation between the pharmacokinetic and safety data of this regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and topotecan IV continuously
      on days 1-15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with measurable disease who achieve a response
      may receive additional therapy at the discretion of the principal investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and topotecan until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed through day 30.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
