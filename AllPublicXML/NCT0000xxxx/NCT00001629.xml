  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important physiological and pathophysiological
      role in the control of blood pressure and plasma volume. Inhibition of the RAS is useful in
      the treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure and in some patients with myocardial
      infarction. Several recent clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
      (ACEI) have shown that they also reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction, but the
      mechanisms underlying this anti-ischemic effect are poorly understood. ACEI reduce
      angiotensin II synthesis and prevent bradykinin degradation. Results from ongoing studies in
      the Cardiology Branch (Protocol 95-H-0099) designed to investigate the link between ACEI and
      the vascular endothelium indicate that ACEI improve both endothelial dysfunction and
      metabolic coronary vasodilation, an effect that is partially mediated by bradykinin. The
      current protocol is designed to investigate whether the beneficial effects of ACEI on
      endothelial function are also partly due to inhibition of angiotensin II. The recent
      development of selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists allows us to
      specifically examine the effects of angiotensin II on vasomotor activity.
