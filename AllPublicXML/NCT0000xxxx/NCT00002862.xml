    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol in treating patients with
      refractory cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of perillyl alcohol given chronically three times per
      day in patients with refractory malignancies.

      II. Describe the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics associated with this regimen.

      III. Evaluate any antitumor activity of perillyl alcohol in these patients. IV. Assess the
      ability of perillyl alcohol to induce tumor differentiation and reduce telomerase activity in
      patients from whom serial biopsies can be obtained.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of perillyl
      alcohol.

      Groups of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oral perillyl alcohol three times per day
      until the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase II dose is determined. Treatment at the
      assigned dose continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes.
      Patients with stable disease after 8 weeks of treatment are removed from study.

      Patients are followed for duration of response and survival.
