      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel, carboplatin, and
      gemcitabine in treating patients who have previously untreated, newly diagnosed epithelial
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel, carboplatin, and
      gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated, newly diagnosed, high-risk epithelial
      cancer of mullerian origin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive
      docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Carboplatin
      IV is administered over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5
      patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2
      years.
