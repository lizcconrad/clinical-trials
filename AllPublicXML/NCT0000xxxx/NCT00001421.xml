      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of the drug methimazole in treating
      polymyositis and dermatomyositis-inflammatory muscle diseases causing weakness and muscle
      wasting. Although it is not known what causes of these diseases, abnormal immune function is
      thought to be involved. Recent studies indicate that methimazole, which has been used for
      many years to treat thyroid disease, may alter immune activity by affecting the interaction
      between white blood cells called lymphocytes and certain molecules on cell surfaces. This
      study will examine the effects of methimazole on immune activity and muscle strength in
      patients with inflammatory muscle diseases and evaluate the drug side effects.

      Patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis who have normal thyroid function may be
      eligible for this study [age requirement?]. Candidates will undergo a history and physical
      examination; blood and urine tests; chest X-ray; muscle strength testing, daily living skills
      questionnaire, and speech and swallowing evaluation; magnetic resonance imaging of muscles;
      and muscle biopsy (removal of a small piece of muscle tissue under local anesthetic). When
      indicated, some candidates may also have cancer screening tests (for example, mammogram, Pap
      smear), a lung function test to measure breathing capacity, or an electromyogram, in which
      small needles are inserted into a muscle to measure the electrical activity .

      Participants will take 30 mg of methimazole by mouth twice a day for 6 months. They will have
      blood tests weekly for the first 2 weeks and then every other week for the rest of the study
      to measure blood counts and liver and thyroid function. Blood will also be drawn for white
      blood cell studies during the screening evaluation, at the beginning of therapy, 6 to 12
      weeks after therapy starts, at the end of the 6-month treatment period, and 1 and 3 months
      after therapy ends. Muscle enzyme and urine tests will be done once a month.. During drug
      treatment, patients will have periodic physical examinations and blood and muscle function
      tests to evaluate the response to therapy.

      This open label pilot study will assess the (1) activity of methimazole (MMI), a
      down-regulator of MHC Class I transcription used in treatment of autoimmune thyroiditis
      (AIT), on the tissue expression of HLA class I and its (2) efficacy as measured by serum
      muscle enzyme levels and manual muscle testing in up to twenty patients with dermatomyositis
      (DM) or polymyositis (PM). Participants will have persistent weakness, laboratory evidence of
      inflammation and be on a stable regimen of medication to control their myopathy. MMI will be
      administered orally at 30 mg twice a day for six months. Patients will be evaluated for
      alteration of HLA Class I expression in muscle and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and
      drug-related toxicities during the study and for three months after the discontinuation of
      treatment.

        iii. phagocytosis

        iv. interstitial mononuclear infiltration;
