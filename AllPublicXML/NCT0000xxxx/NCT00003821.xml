      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminopterin in treating patients who
      have refractory or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the antitumor activity of aminopterin in patients with persistent,
      recurrent, or refractory endometrial carcinoma who have failed prior first line cytotoxic
      chemotherapy. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of aminopterin in
      this patient population. III. Determine the overall patient survival and time to progression
      of these patients. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral aminopterin every 12 hours twice weekly. Treatment continues
      for up to 15 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
