      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of bile externalization and antibiotic gut sterilization
      on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil in patients who have undergone orthotopic
      liver transplantation.

      II. Correlate serum concentrations of mycophenolic acid with inosine monophosphate
      dehydrogenase activity in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients begin a mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-containing regimen within the first 5 days after
      transplantation. Patients have blood drawn on postoperative days 7, 21, 42, 70, 98, 126, and
      154. Urine is collected on postoperative days 7, 21, and 42. Patients with T-tube bile
      externalization also have bile collected on postoperative day 7.
