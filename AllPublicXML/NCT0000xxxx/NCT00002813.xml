      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin
      and vinorelbine in treating patients with refractory or recurrent squamous cell cervical
      cancer that has not responded to local therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of cisplatin and vinorelbine in terms of response rate,
      duration of response, time to treatment failure, and survival in patients with advanced,
      persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours beginning after completion of vinorelbine
      infusion on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 20 months.
