      This 2-part study will test the safety and anti-HIV activity of capravirine alone, and the
      safety, anti-HIV activity, and drug interactions of capravirine combined with other anti-HIV
      drugs. Capravirine belongs to a class of drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NNRTIs), which are effective when used together with other drugs, including
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors.

      Normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may enroll in Part 1 of the study. HIV-infected
      patients 18 years of age and older who have not previously been treated with a NNRTI
      (efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine) may participate in Part 2. All prospective study
      participants will be screened for eligibility with a physical examination, blood tests, a
      urine test and an electrocardiogram (ECG).

      Part 1 - Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups as follows:

      Group 1 will receive capravirine alone for 7 days and capravirine plus efavirenz (another
      NNRTI) for an additional 10 days. On day 1, participants will have a physical examination,
      urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected just before the first
      dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the dose. A
      small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle sticks. On day 8,
      participants will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples
      will be drawn again as described above. In the evening of day 8, efavirenz will be added to
      the regimen. On day 18 (the last day of the study), participants will have another physical
      examination and blood tests. Blood will again be collected as described above.

      Group 2 will take capravirine alone for 8) days and capravirine plus ritonavir (a protease
      inhibitor) for an additional 8 days. Physical examinations, urine tests, and blood
      collections will be done as described above on day 1, day 8 and day 16 (the last day) of the
      study.

      Part 2 - Patients will take capravirine alone for 7 days. On day 1, patients will have a
      physical examination, urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected
      just before the first dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12
      hours after the dose. A small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle
      sticks. On day 8, patients will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests.
      Blood samples will be drawn again as described above. Additional drugs will then be added to
      the regimen (in varying doses according to group), as follows:

      Group 1 - efavirenz plus abacavir

      Group 2 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir

      Group 3 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir

      On day 15, the procedures performed on day 8 will be repeated.

      Patients will have the option of having blood drawn daily on days 2 through 7 to measure
      HIV-1 viral load and of having a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) done between days 2 and 7 to
      measure how well capravirine gets into the central nervous system.

      After day 15, patients in all groups will continue with their drug regimen until week 48 or
      until it is determined that the treatment is not effective for the patient. Physical
      examinations, viral load measurements, white blood cell counts and other blood tests will be
      done periodically throughout the trial. Within 4 weeks after the end of the study, patients
      will be followed with another physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an ECG.

      This is an open-label, phase I study examining the safety and anti-HIV activity of an
      investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, capravirine. The primary
      objectives of the study are 1) To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of capravirine
      when combined with efavirenz and (low-dose) ritonavir in non-HIV-infected volunteers; 2) To
      evaluate the safety, virologic activity, and pharmacokinetics of capravirine when combined
      with efavirenz, (low-dose) ritonavir, and abacavir in HIV-infected patients; and 3) To
      evaluate the safety, virologic activity, and pharmacokinetics of a once-daily regimen with
      capravirine, efavirenz, (low-dose) ritonavir, and abacavir in HIV-infected patients. The
      study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part I will examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      potential drug interactions of capravirine with other antiretroviral agents in
      non-HIV-infected volunteers. Sixteen volunteers (8 per group) will receive capravirine
      monotherapy (7 days), followed by the addition of either: 1) efavirenz (10 days); or 2)
      ritonavir (8 days). Part II will examine the safety, virologic activity, pharmacokinetics,
      and potential drug interactions of capravirine in HIV-infected patients. Thirty patients (10
      per group) will receive of capravirine monotherapy (7 days), followed by the randomized
      addition of: 1) efavirenz/abacavir (7 days); 2) ritonavir/efavirenz/abacavir (7 days)
      twice-daily regimen; or 3) ritonavir/efavirenz/abacavir (7 days) once-daily regimen. [Doses
      of capravirine may be changed depending upon pharmacokinetic data obtained from Part I of the
      study.] The primary efficacy endpoint is the time-to-virologic-failure.
