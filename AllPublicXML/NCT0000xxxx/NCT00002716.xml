      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not
      yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intrahepatic floxuridine,
      leucovorin, and dexamethasone with that of systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating
      patients who have unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy, toxicity, and cost of hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine,
           leucovorin calcium (CF), and dexamethasone vs IV fluorouracil and IV CF after resection
           of primary disease in patients with hepatic metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Measure the level of thymidylate synthase present in liver metastases, and correlate
           these levels with objective response and survival in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Assess the p53 mutations, and correlate findings with objective response and survival in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, percentage of liver involvement on CT scan or MRI (less than 30% vs 30% to under
      70%), prior chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and
      leucovorin calcium (CF) or 5-FU, CF, and levamisole (LEV) completed at least 1 year before
      study vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 5-FU with or without LEV completed at least 6
      months before study), and synchronous disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

    <description>Patients undergo laparotomy for placement of a hepatic artery catheter and then subcutaneous placement of a hepatic artery infusion pump. Patients with unresected primary disease also undergo resection at the time of catheter and pump placement. Beginning within 1-2 weeks after surgery, patients receive floxuridine, dexamethasone, and leucovorin calcium (CF) via continuous hepatic artery infusion on days 1-14. Treatment for patients continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Quality of life and medical resource utilization are assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then at 18 months.
Patients are followed every 3 months.</description>
