  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to diagnose and follow patients with disorders of movement control.
      Patients participating in this study will undergo routine laboratory tests and examinations
      in order to monitor their condition.

      Doctors at the NIH will work in cooperation with each patient's primary care physician. There
      will be no use of investigational treatments in this study.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Objective:

      This protocol is a screening protocol, which allows for evaluation of patients and families
      where neurological conditions are present for enrollment into other studies. It is also a
      teaching and training instrument for the MNB fellows, allowing them to gain expertise in the
      evaluation and treatment of patients. Finally, it will be used to screen healthy volunteers
      to create a pool of potential future HV matches for HMCS protocols.

      Study population:

      The following population groups may participate:

        -  Subjects with neurological disorders who are 2 years old or older,

        -  Family members who are 2 years old or older of people with a neurological disorder

        -  Healthy volunteers who are 18 years old or older.

        -  National Institutes of Health (NIH) employees (other than those employed by HMCS in
           NINDS) may participate.

      Design:

      The goal is to screen patients with neurological conditions and family members of patients
      with neurological conditions for enrollment in additional research protocols. No
      investigational treatments will be administered on this protocol and the NIH physicians will
      be playing a consultative role to the patient s primary physician.

      We will also screen healthy volunteers to create a pool of potential future HV matches for
      other HMCS protocols.

      Outcome measures:

      This is a natural history screening protocol to evaluate patients with neurological disorders
      and their family members, and to screen healthy volunteers for to create a pool of potential
      future HV matches other HMCS protocols. Therefore, there is no outcome measure.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with neurological disorders and subjects with a family history of
             neurological conditions OR

          -  Healthy volunteers: People age 18 or older who are generally in good health.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients &lt;2 years old.

          -  Employees of HMCS in NINDS.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MRI (patients and family members only):

        We will follow the Clinical Radiology/NMR Center guidelines for MR safety. Some of the
        exclusions are:

          -  Have non-MRI compatible metal in the body, such as a cardiac pacemaker, brain
             stimulator, shrapnel, surgical metal, clips in the brain or on blood vessels, cochlear
             implants, artificial heart valves or metal fragments in the eye as these make having
             an MRI unsafe.

          -  Have metallic dental fillings which are likely to cause MRI artifacts

          -  Unable to lie flat on the back for the expected length of the experiment, up to 30
             mins.

          -  Uncomfortable being in a small space for the expected length of the experiment, up to
             30 mins.

          -  Pregnancy.
