      RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in soy foods appears to reduce the risk of some types of
      cancer. Isoflavones are compounds found in soy food that may prevent the development of
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to determine the most effective amount and type of soy isoflavones
      needed in the diets of healthy men and women to prevent cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of varying the dietary intake of soy nuts on plasma
      levels and urinary excretion of isoflavones. II. Determine the effects of different food
      composition, along with age and gender of subjects, on plasma levels and urinary excretion of
      isoflavones.

      OUTLINE: This is a two part study. In part I; participants are stratified according to
      menopausal status. In part II; participants are stratified according to gender and age (under
      50 vs. over 50). Part I - Study participants are given 3 different amounts of toasted soy
      nuts separated by one month intervals. The sequence in which each amount is given is
      randomized. Blood and urine samples are taken to measure isoflavone levels. Part II - Study
      participants are given toasted soy nuts, soy milk, and tempeh on separate occasions separated
      by one month intervals. The sequence of each food is randomized. Blood and urine samples are
      taken to measure isoflavone levels.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 10 women, 5 premenopausal and 5 postmenopausal, will be accrued for part I
      of the study. 80 subjects, 40 women and 40 men, will be accrued for part II.
