    <textblock>
      This project will provide relevant clinical information for primary care practitioners
      treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome in outpatient settings. This double-blind, placebo-
      controlled clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of lorazepam (Ativan) and
      carbamazepine (Tegretol) in alcoholics who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of uncomplicated
      alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Participants are randomized to five days of treatment with a
      1-week posttreatment followup.

          -  Must live within 50 miles or one hour of the study site and have reliable
             transportation to the site.

          -  Must have a significant other who will provide a collateral report, attend outpatient
             visits, and be available by telephone.

          -  Subjects must be medically stable.

          -  Must have a clinical withdrawal assessment prior to study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets criteria for any other substance dependence syndrome other than alcohol
             dependence or marijuana abuse.

          -  Use of other illicit psychoactive substances (except marijuana) in the last 7 days.

          -  Use of pharmaceutical agents within the last 14 days that are known to lower the
             seizure threshold, augment or decrease the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

          -  History of status epilepticus or two or more seizures occurring within 24- hour period
             during a previous alcohol withdrawal or other forms of epilepsy.

          -  Current major depressive illness, dementia, suicidal or homicidal ideation, or past or
             present schizophrenia.

          -  Acute medical instability as characterized by hepatic encephalopathy, past or present
             severe liver failure.

          -  Diabetes requiring insulin, or severe renal disease.

          -  Pregnant females.

          -  High blood pressure.

             with safety during outpatient withdrawal.

          -  History of severe gastrointestinal (GI) disease which might render absorption of the
             medication difficult or produce medical instability of the patient during
             detoxification which would include active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis,
             regional ileitis, or evidence by history or physical examination of GI bleeding.

          -  Familial tremor or other neurological condition, determined by history, known to
