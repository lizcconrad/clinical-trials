      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective than observation alone in
      treating bladder cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy to see how well
      it works compared to observation alone in treating patients with bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder with p53 gene alterations treated with methotrexate,
           vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin vs observation alone.

        -  Compare the recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with or without p53 gene
           alterations treated with observation alone.

        -  Examine the expression of p53 and other genes, particularly RB, p21, and p16, involved
           in cell cycle regulation that may be involved in the response to chemotherapy in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate p53 mutational gene status with p53 protein expression by
           immunohistochemistry, outcome (recurrence-free and overall survival), response to
           chemotherapy, and expression of key molecules in the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway in
           patients treated with this regimen vs observation alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups based on the status of the p53 gene in the bladder tumor.

        -  Group A (p53 gene alteration, defined by greater than 10% nuclear reactivity): Patients
           are stratified according to age (under 65 vs 65 and over), stage (P1 vs P2a vs P2b),
           grade (1 or 2 vs 3 or 4), and p21 status. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
           arms within 10 weeks after radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and
           within 2 weeks after registration.

             -  Arm I: Within 2 weeks after randomization, patients receive methotrexate IV on days
                1, 15, and 22; vinblastine IV on days 2, 15, and 22; and doxorubicin IV and
                cisplatin IV on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation for recurrence but do not receive adjuvant
                chemotherapy after surgery.

      Patients who are eligible for randomization but decline to be randomized undergo observation
      for recurrence.

        -  Group B (p53 gene normal, defined by less than 10% nuclear reactivity): Patients undergo
           observation for recurrence but do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.75 years.

      <pre_assignment_details>Patients with stage pT1/T2N0M0 urothelial cancer who had undergone a radical cystectomy within the prior 9 weeks were eligible for enrollment. Twenty-two patients who were registered were never assigned to a group after enrolling due to: missing baseline documentation (5), incorrect disease stage (13), and patient withdrawal (4).</pre_assignment_details>
