      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with
      cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. II.
      Determine the dose limiting toxicity of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin and
      irinotecan in this patient population. III. Establish the recommended phase II dose for this
      regimen in this patient population. IV. Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in
      selected solid tumor malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. All patients receive paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour, then cisplatin IV over 30 minutes, followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes
      weekly for 4 weeks on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment is repeated every six weeks for at
      least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of
      3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel. If 2 or more patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level, escalation ceases and the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the previous dose level. Patients are followed until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
