      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may interfere with the body's ability to recognize transplanted bone
      marrow cells as foreign and may help treat patients with graft-versus-host disease.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating
      patients who have chronic graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of thalidomide in patients with steroid dependent or
      refractory chronic graft vs host disease following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. II.
      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to the type of bone
      marrow transplant received (allogeneic vs matched unrelated donor) and type of chronic graft
      vs host disease (steroid dependent vs steroid refractory). Patients receive either oral
      thalidomide or placebo 2-4 times a day for 6 months. The drug is then tapered until stopped.
      If disease recurs, the drug may be restarted for a second 6 month course. The maximum
      duration of treatment is 18 months. Patients continue on steroid therapy, which is tapered
      during study therapy. If no response is seen after 8 weeks, patients may cross over to the
      other alternate drug. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, then every month for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients (18 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
