      This protocol is designed to evaluate the side effects of rV-DF3/MUC1 and to determine the
      safest dose which should be used in the treatment of breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with recombinant
      vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. II.
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of rV-DF3/MUC1, based on cellular and humoral immunity,
      in these patients. III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-DF3/MUC1 is associated with
      antitumor activity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vaccinia
      DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) intradermally. Treatment repeats every month for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 6 patients
      receive escalating doses of rV-DF3/MUC1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest
      dose level to be tested is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.

    <description>- The starting dose for this Phase I study of rV-DF3/MUC1 will be 4.76 x 106 PFU.
-- Dose escalation will proceed with cohorts of at least 6 patients as follows: Per vaccination
Level 1 4.76 x 106 PFU

    <criteria>

        -  Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
             breast. Patients may have measurable disease, but it is not required. Patients may
             have received any number of prior therapies for metastatic disease. Untreated patients
             are also eligible.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Patients must have an ECOG = Performance Status of 0-1

          -  Patients must have a WBC &gt; 2000/mm 3 and a platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function documented by a serum creatinine &lt; 2.0
             mg/d1.

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function demonstrated by a serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0
             mg/di, and a SGPT &lt; 4 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  ≥3 weeks since chemotherapy (&gt; 6 weeks for nitosoureas or mitomycin C), hormonal
             therapy or radiation therapy

          -  Immunologic testing must be at least normal as defined by at least normal delayed type
             hypersensitivity, at least normal CD4: CD8 ratio (&gt;1), at least normal lymphocyte
             proliferation testing (to Con A), and at least normal immunoglobulin levels

          -  Patients must not have evidence of altered immune responsiveness or autoimmune
             syndromes (scleroderma,systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Patients must be HIV
             negative. This treatment may be associated with increased adverse effects for
             individuals with immune deficiencies, and HIV-associated symptoms preclude accurate
             assessment of toxicity.

          -  Patients must not have undergone splenectomy.

          -  Patients with active cases or history of extensive skin disorders (such as extensive
             psoriasis, burns, impetigo, disseminated zoster) are ineligible.

          -  Patients must not have any other serious medical condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator is incompatible with the protocol. Patients with active infections
             requiring antibiotics are not eligible until the infection has cleared and the
             antibiotics have been stopped for at least 3 days.

          -  Patients must be able to avoid close contact with children &lt; 3 years of age, pregnant
             women, individuals with eczema or skin conditions and immune suppressed individuals
             during a period of two weeks after each vaccination.

          -  Patients must not have a history of seizures, encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.

          -  Patients must not be allergic to eggs.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to a possible increased risk with
             exposure to vaccinia virus of both mother and newborn as well as unknown risks to the
             fetus.

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must not have evidence of altered immune responsiveness or autoimmune

             negative This treatment may be associated with increased adverse effects for
             individuals with immune deficiencies, and HIV-associated symptoms preclude accurate
             assessment of toxicity.

          -  Patients must not have undergone splenectomy

          -  Patients with active cases or history of extensive skin disorders (such as extensive
             psoriasis, burns, impetigo, disseminated zoster) are ineligible.

          -  Patients must not have any other serious medical condition which in the opinion of the
