  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of diclazuril capsules compared with placebo capsules as
      treatment of cryptosporidial related diarrhea in AIDS patients. Treatment efficacy will be
      based on the drug's clinical results and on its anti-protozoan effects. Safety will be
      assessed by the occurrence of side effects as reported by patients at their visits and by
      frequent monitoring of hematology, biochemistries, and urinalysis.
