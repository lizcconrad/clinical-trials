  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of repeated courses of sargramostim ( recombinant
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF ) administered subcutaneously to
      patients with HIV infection and leukopenia. To determine if administration of GM-CSF will
      prevent some or all of the hematologic toxicity associated with zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment
      in patients with pre-existing leukopenia. To assess any clinical and/or virologic benefits
      from administering alternating weeks of GM-CSF and AZT to patients with symptomatic HIV
      infection who have a history of cytologically confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP
      ) or a circulating absolute CD4 lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/mm3.
