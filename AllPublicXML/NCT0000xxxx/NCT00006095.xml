      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vincristine plus irinotecan in treating
      children who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of vincristine when
           administered in combination with irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safe and tolerable phase II dose of this combination regimen in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this combination regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of other toxicities of this combination regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this combination regimen in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vincristine.

      Patients receive vincristine IV on day 2 of the first course (day 1 of subsequent courses)
      and days 8, 15, 22, and 29, and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 22-26. Courses
      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with responsive or stable disease receive additional courses of therapy for a maximum of 1
      year.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vincristine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
