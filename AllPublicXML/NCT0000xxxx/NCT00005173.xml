      To evaluate whether the long-term use of oral contraceptives, after discontinuation, was
      associated with an increased incidence of first nonfatal myocardial infarction among women
      above the age of 50.

      BACKGROUND:

      In the mid 1980s, it was known that current oral contraceptive use (in the preceding month)
      increased the risk of myocardial infarction three to four-fold. Evidence seemed to indicate
      that past use lasting a total of five or more years was associated with a residual two-fold
      increase in myocardial infarction risk among women 40 to 49 years old. Since the incidence of
      the disease started to become appreciable beyond age 49, it was of public health importance
      to reexamine the evidence in a data base which included women aged 50 or older to determine
      how long the increased risk persisted and whether it varied according to the formulation of
      the preparation used. An increase in risk that persisted after discontinuation of oral
      contraceptive use would have major public health implications since millions of women have
      used or will use oral contraceptives for long periods.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The design was that of a case-control study. Cases were identified by weekly telephone calls
      to the coronary care units of 78 hospitals in greater Boston, Southern Connecticut, and
      Westchester County. Nurse-interviewers administered standard interviews to cases convalescing
      on medical wards after discharge from coronary care units and to controls identified in the
      same hospitals. Histories of oral contraceptive use, including the timing and duration of use
      and the name of the preparations, were recorded along with information on other drug use and
      myocardial infarction risk factors such as cigarette smoking. Data were collected for three
      years.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
