      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan and gemcitabine in
      treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the principal toxicities of irinotecan
           and gemcitabine in patients with surgically unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine if the principal toxicities and MTD of this combination regimen are affected
           by drug sequencing in this patient population.

        -  Determine the potential for gemcitabine to alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics
           when administered with irinotecan in these patients.

        -  Describe the influence effected by varying the administration sequence of this
           combination regimen in this patient population.

        -  Obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy of this combination regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, patients receive
      subsequent doses of the inverse sequence of the combination drugs until a new MTD is
      determined.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and gemcitabine until the MTD
      is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
