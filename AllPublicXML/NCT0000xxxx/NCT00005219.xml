  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a two-year follow up of participants in a cross-sectional study of physical
      activity determinants. Predictors of change in vigorous exercise habits and recreational
      walking habits were identified as were determinants of change in the proportion of the sample
      who initiated, maintained, or discontinued exercise.

      BACKGROUND:

      In 1988 when the study began, epidemiological studies had shown the health benefits of
      physical activity and that prevalence of physical activity was well below recommended levels.
      Exercise-promotion interventions were typically ineffective, and lack of knowledge of
      exercise determinants inhibited the design of effective interventions.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data from the San Diego Health and Exercise Baseline survey conducted in 1986 were used to
      contact participants for the follow-up. The difference in reported activity level from time 1
      to time 2 served as an estimate of change in activity. The follow-up survey elicited a
      two-year history of vigorous exercise and moderate-intensity exercise, both of which have
      substantial health benefits, as well as different determinants. Potential predictors were
      assessed at baseline and included demographic variables and indices based on social learning
      theory. Multiple regression analyses determine the combined and independent relationships of
      such variables as self-efficacy, social support, perceived barriers and benefits and
      environmental factors on both types of physical activity change. A second analysis separated
      subjects into the baseline physical activity groups of low, intermediate, and high activity
      and examined prediction of change versus no-change in each category.
