      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor
      killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus
      etoposide in treating patients who have neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of monoclonal antibody 3F8, etoposide, and isotretinoin
           using standard imaging methods and tumor marker studies in patients with high-risk
           neuroblastoma.

        -  Assess progression-free survival in these patients after this treatment.

        -  Assess the effects of oral etoposide on human anti-mouse antibody and anti-idiotype
           response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease status (evaluable but not measurable vs
      second or subsequent remission with no measurable or evaluable disease).

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody 3F8 (MOAB 3F8) IV over 1.5 hours once daily on days 1-10
      and oral etoposide once daily on days 29-49. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      If HAMA fails to develop after completion of 4 courses of MOAB 3F8, patients continue
      treatment with MOAB 3F8 on days 1-5 every 8 weeks until HAMA reaches greater than 1,000 U/mL
      or until month 24, whichever occurs first.

      Beginning after completion of 4 courses of etoposide and MOAB 3F8 or if HAMA develops,
      patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily for 14 days followed by at least a 14-day
      rest. Treatment repeats for a total of 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 5 years.
