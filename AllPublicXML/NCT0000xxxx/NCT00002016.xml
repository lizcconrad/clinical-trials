  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerance of 3 dosage levels of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      monoclonal antibody (SDZ MSL-109) when administered once every 2 weeks for a total of 8 doses
      during the maintenance phase of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy to patients with AIDS and
      documented evidence of CMV retinitis. In addition for those patients with positive CMV
      cultures upon entry into this trial a preliminary attempt will be made to assess the
      potential in vivo antiviral effects of the concomitant administration of DHPG and SDZ
      MSL-109.
