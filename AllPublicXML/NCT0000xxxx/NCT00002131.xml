  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the safety and efficacy of two doses of vesnarinone in patients with AIDS-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-eight patients (14 per cohort) receive daily vesnarinone at one of two doses. At least
      seven patients at the lower dose must have completed 2 weeks of therapy before subsequent
      patients are entered at the higher dose. Patients who successfully complete 16 weeks of
      treatment may receive maintenance therapy for the duration of the study (approximately 12-18
      months).
