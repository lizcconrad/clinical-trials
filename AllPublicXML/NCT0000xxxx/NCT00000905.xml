  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to stop maintenance therapy in HIV-positive
      patients with treated and healed CMV retinitis (eye disease) who have responded well to
      anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy.

      The current therapies available to treat CMV retinitis are long-term therapies. However, it
      may be safe to stop long-term anti-CMV therapy in patients with healed CMV retinitis and
      stable CD4 counts resulting from taking a combination of at least 2 antiretroviral drugs.

      This study proposes to assess the hypothesis that, in HIV-infected patients with treated and
      healed CMV retinitis, an increase in CD4+ T-cells after initiation of potent antiretroviral
      therapy is either directly related to, or a marker of, immunologic protection for CMV
      retinitis and is associated with a recovery in specific proliferation responses to CMV
      antigens.

      In this study, 100 patients [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99: 50 patients] with treated and healed,
      non-immediate sight-threatening CMV retinitis will discontinue maintenance therapy for
      suppression of CMV retinitis. Patients are studied in 2 groups. Patients enrolled in Group 1
      have CD4+ counts greater than 100 cells/mm3. Group 2 patients have CD4+ counts of 50-100
      cells/mm3 and a minimum of a 2 log10 decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA level or plasma HIV-1 RNA
      levels below the limit of detection while receiving potent antiretroviral therapy for at
      least 8 weeks prior to entry [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99: Group 2 has been withdrawn]. An
      additional 25 patients who meet eligibility requirements but who choose to continue to
      receive maintenance therapy may also participate. All patients are followed to evaluate the
      relationship between reactivation or progression of CMV disease and changes in CMV DNA, HIV-1
      RNA, and CD4+ cell counts. Patients are seen at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8, and every 4 weeks until
      study closure or for 12 months after the last subject is enrolled. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      12/24/98: Patients with confirmed moderate to severe &quot;immune recovery vitritis&quot; should
      receive a 3-week course of systemic steroids (oral prednisone recommended). Moderate immune
      recovery vitritis is defined as symptomatic decrease in visual acuity of 2 or more Snellen
      lines along with, in the absence of active CMV disease, either 2+ or greater vitreous haze as
      defined by Nussenblatt et al., or cystoid macular edema.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99: During
      the course of the study in patients with confirmed cystoid macular edema and a concomitant
      reduction in visual activity below 20/40, both attributable to immune recovery
      vitritis/uveitis only, a 21-day course of oral prednisone is recommended. This initial course
      of steroids helps to determine whether there is an improvement in vision or a decrease in
      macular edema. Long-term management of immune recovery vitritis/uveitis may include
      intraocular injection of steroids. Ophthalmoscopic examinations and laboratory tests are
      performed as per protocol.]

             transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).

          -  Have a life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Are at least 13 years old (need consent if under 18).

        Exclusion Criteria

        You will not be eligible for this study if you:
