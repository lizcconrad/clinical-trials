      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses
      of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with thiotepa,
      carboplatin, and topotecan followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who
      have metastatic or progressive rare cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Improve the long term disease-free survival of patients with rare cancers at high risk
           for lethal relapse by using myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa, carboplatin, and
           topotecan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. Patients
      receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -8 to -6, carboplatin IV over 4 hours on
      days -5 to -3, and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4. Autologous bone marrow or
      PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV twice daily beginning on
      day 1.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed malignancy of one of the following types:

               -  Wilms' tumor

               -  Liver cancer

               -  Desmoplastic or other small round cell tumor

               -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

               -  Fibrosarcoma

          -  Disease that has metastasized and has a cure rate of no greater than 25% with
             conventional treatment or disease that has progressed after prior chemotherapy, was
             not then surgically resectable, and has a salvage rate with nonmyeloablative therapies
             of no greater than 25% required

          -  Maximal benefit from conventional (nonmyeloablative) doses of combination chemotherapy
             required prior to entry, and it is recommended that patients have received a minimum
             of one of the following:

               -  2 courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide (as per protocol MSKCC-90062)

               -  2 courses of high-dose ifosfamide/etoposide (as in the poor-risk sarcoma protocol
                  MSKCC-90071A)

               -  1 course of high-dose cyclophosphamide plus 1 course of high-dose
