      The purpose of this study is to see how the body processes 1592U89 and ethanol (pure grain
      alcohol) when they are given together.

      Patients are randomized to one of the following three regimens:

      Regimen 1: 1592U89 alone. Regimen 2: pure grain alcohol diluted in orange juice. Regimen 3:
      1592U89 plus pure grain alcohol diluted in orange juice. Treatment is administered weekly for
      3 weeks.
