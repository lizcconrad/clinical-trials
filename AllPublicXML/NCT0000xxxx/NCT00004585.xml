  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a certain combination of anti-HIV drugs is safe and
      effective in HIV-infected patients. The drug combination includes a tablet containing
      lamivudine and zidovudine (called Combivir) plus abacavir plus efavirenz.

    <textblock>
      Patients take open-label Combivir plus abacavir plus efavirenz for 48 weeks. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 4/20/00: Patients taking Combivir plus abacavir at Week 24 receive the
      triple-nucleoside-combination tablet (TCT) (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine) beginning at Week
      24 and continuing through Week 48, in combination with efavirenz (or nevirapine if the
      patient has made a protocol-allowed substitution). Patients not taking Combivir and abacavir
      at Week 24 will continue in the study on the substituted protocol-allowed drug regimen,
      provided their plasma HIV RNA is below 400 copies/ml at 24 weeks.] Following enrollment on
      Study Day 1, on-study evaluations (virologic and safety) are performed at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,
      16, and then every 8 weeks through Week 48 (end of study). CD4 evaluations are performed at
      baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, and then every 8 weeks through Week 48. Immune reconstitution
      testing is performed at baseline and at Weeks 12, 24, and 48. Patients complete the PMAQ7
      version 1.1 medication adherence questionnaire at Weeks 2, 8, 12, 24, and 48 (or at their
      last study visit). All patients are requested to return for a post-study follow-up evaluation
      2 to 4 weeks after the last on-study visit. Patients must have a plasma HIV RNA less than 400
      copies/ml at Week 24 in order to continue in the study.
