      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using arzoxifene hydrochloride may fight the endometrial cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen by the tumor cells

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well arzoxifene hydrochloride works in treating
      women with recurrent, advanced, or metastatic endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective tumor response rate (complete response and partial
      response) to arzoxifene hydrochloride in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial
      cancer. II. Determine the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response
      duration, and survival in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer receiving
      arzoxifene hydrochloride. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV.
      Measure changes in serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and
      sex hormone binding globulin during this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified

      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not
      update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to
      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion
      date. This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act
      of 2007 (FDAAA).
