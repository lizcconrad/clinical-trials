  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if zidovudine (AZT) and acetaminophen (APAP) interact when given to the same
      patient, and if so, the manner of interaction. Patients with AIDS often require therapy with
      painkillers for the management of mild pain and discomfort associated with their disease, and
      APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to treat AIDS patients. It is important for
      doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact when given to the same patient, because
      other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT may have to be adjusted when given with
      APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.

      Patients with AIDS often require therapy with painkillers for the management of mild pain and
      discomfort associated with their disease, and APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to
      treat AIDS patients. It is important for doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact
      when given to the same patient, because other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT
      may have to be adjusted when given with APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.

      Persons who are infected with HIV and have symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss) of AIDS are
      eligible for the study. They will be given AZT orally every 4 hours or APAP orally every 8
      hours alone or in combination for 4 days while at home. On the 4th day, participants will be
      admitted to a clinical research center for studies to determine how they are tolerating the
      medicine. On the 5th day, any scheduled 8 am doses of AZT will be given intravenously, while
      the scheduled doses of APAP will still be given orally. Repeated blood samples will be taken
      over the next 12 hours and urine will be collected for 24 hours. The process will be repeated
      at weekly intervals for 3 weeks, so that each patient receives AZT alone, APAP alone, and the
      combination of AZT and APAP.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Severe ongoing opportunistic infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP),
             cryptococcal or toxoplasmosis meningoencephalitis, disseminated herpes simplex or
             herpes zoster. A demonstrated prior sensitivity or an experience of significant
             adverse effects during prior therapy with the drug to be used in the study.

          -  Significant diarrhea at entry ( &gt; 1 watery stool/day).

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Severe ongoing opportunistic infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP),
             cryptococcal or toxoplasmosis meningoencephalitis, disseminated herpes simplex or
             herpes zoster. A demonstrated prior sensitivity or an experience of significant
             adverse effects during prior therapy with the drug to be used in the study.

          -  Significant diarrhea at entry ( &gt; 1 watery stool/day).

        AIDS related complex (ARC) defined as presence of any one of the following within 12 months
        prior to entry and absence of a concurrent illness or condition other than

        HIV infection to explain the findings:

          -  Fever of &gt; 38.5 degrees C persisting for longer than 3 weeks.

          -  Involuntary weight loss of &gt; 15 lbs. or &gt; 10 percent of baseline noted in a 120-day
             period prior to evaluation.

          -  History of diarrhea (&gt; 2 liquid stools per day) persisting for longer than 1 month but
             not occurring at entry.

          -  History of clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis or hairy leukoplakia. Patients who
             have AIDS-defined opportunistic infections or tumors.

          -  Patients eligible for zidovudine under the labeling. A positive HIV antibody test.
             Exceptions will be made for patients with a previously positive HIV antibody test with
             progressive disease and patients where virus isolation has been made. A life
             expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients with stable Kaposi's sarcoma, mild herpes infections, mild or stable
             depression, asymptomatic or mild cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection, or a
             hepatitis B virus carrier state will be acceptable for study.

        Inability to abstain from alcohol or any other drug, including nonprescription medications,
        during the study period.
