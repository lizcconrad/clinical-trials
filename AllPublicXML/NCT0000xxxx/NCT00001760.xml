      Cytokine Production Patterns in Patients with Systemic Mastocytosis Compared with Atopic
      Dermatitis and Healthy Individuals

      Summary: This study will examine how mast cells (cells involved in allergic reactions)
      migrate and multiply in the skin of patients with mastocytosis, a condition characterized by
      too many mast cells in the body. The mast cells tend to multiply in the skin, causing dark,
      itchy skin spots known as urticaria pigmentosa. This study will determine if the skin of
      patients with mastocytosis produces chemicals called cytokines that cause mast cells to
      migrate to the skin and multiply. The findings will be compared with those from normal
      volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis, a skin disease characterized by recurrent
      itchy rash usually seen in people with a family history of allergies.

      Healthy volunteers, patients with mastocytosis and patients with atopic dermatitis 18 years
      of age and older may be eligible for this study. Participants will have the following tests
      and procedures:

        -  Suction blisters - Two to eight small blisters will be raised on the forearm using
           gentle suction. The fluid in the blisters will be collected with a syringe to study the
           chemicals produced by the skin. The tops of the blisters may be removed for research.

        -  Template study - Patients with high cytokine content in the blister fluid may have a
           template study. For this procedure, a plastic block (template) with holes matching the
           blister sites is placed over the blistered area. The wells of the template are filled
           with salt water and the fluid is removed with a syringe at 3, 8 and/or 24 hours.
           Patients are hospitalized for 24 hours for this study.

        -  Skin biopsy - A skin biopsy will be done to correlate cytokine levels with the number of
           mast cells in the skin. An area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic and a small
           circular area about the size of a pencil eraser is removed, using a sharp cookie
           cutter-type instrument.

        -  Blood draw - About 4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to compare the chemicals in the
           blood with those in the blister fluid. The blood will also be analyzed for a complete
           blood count, clotting factors and substances that may be elevated in people with
           allergies.

      Systemic mastocytosis is a disease characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in
      skin, bone marrow and viscera. Precise mechanisms of events leading to the migration and
      proliferation of mast cells in skin is not known. We propose to investigate the in vivo
      cytokine and chemokine production patterns of human skin in patients with mastocytosis and
      compare these findings to those of patients with atopic dermatitis and to healthy volunteers,
      using the suction blister technique. The cytokines/chemokines of interest in this study are
      stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta,
      MCP-1 and RANTES, all of which have been shown to take part in the proliferation,
      differentiation or chemotaxis of mast cells. Our hypothesis is that human skin is producing
      mediators which allow the mast cells to migrate and proliferate in skin, resulting in the
      clinical picture of urticaria pigmentosa. Suction blisters will be generated in patients, and
      the cytokine/chemokine contents of the blister fluids will be analyzed by immunoassay. If the
      chemokine content of the blister fluid is found to be high, chemotaxis of mast cell
      precursors to the skin may also be examined in vivo by placing a template filled with sterile
      saline over the blister sites. Punch biopsies will be performed to correlate cytokine levels
      with mast cell numbers. This study will aid in understanding the pathogenesis of cutaneous
      mast cell disease and may provide insights into the regulation of mast cell growth and
      differentiation in tissue-specific microenvironments. It is hoped that these studies will
      contribute to the design of novel treatment strategies against mast cell associated skin
      diseases.
