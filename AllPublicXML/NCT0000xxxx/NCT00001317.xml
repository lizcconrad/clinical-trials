  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent double-blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center international study, subcutaneous
      injections of interferon-gamma administered three times weekly reduced the frequency of
      serious infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Patients receiving
      interferon-gamma had fewer hospital stays, shorter in length, than the placebo group.
      Children less than 10 years of age benefitted most from treatment and had fewer side effects.

      Based on these data, the FDA licensed interferon-gamma for prophylaxis in CGD patients. We
      wish to monitor our patients who participated in the original study for possible long-term
      side effects. Any new patients referred to us who are either on interferon-gamma or
      considered to be candidates for interferon-gamma will be considered for this protocol. In
      addition, our patients who were originally accepted under Genentech's compassionate plea
      protocol will also be monitored under this new protocol. The patients will be evaluated every
      six months, with blood work and interim medical histories taken.

        The diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease as indicated by an unusual pattern of
        infection in the patient or one pedigree relation, confirmed by both of the following
        tests:

        Abnormal neutrophil NBT slide test (following PMA stimulation) and neutrophil superoxide
        anion production less than or equal to 20 percent normal.

        Preserved renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/100 mL; less than or
        equal to 2+ proteinuria).

        Preserved hepatic function (bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/100 mL; prothrombin time
        less than or equal to 1.3 x control).

        Preserved hematologic function (WBC greater than or equal to 3000/mm3; granulocytes greater
        than 1500/mm3; platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3).

        A minimum life expectancy of three months.

        Patients seropositive for Hepatitis B surface antigen may be entered but serum specimens
        for rIFN-y antibody should not be collected.

        Patients must not be pregnant or lactating.

        Patients of childbearing potential may be entered if using effective contraception.

        Full recovery from previous serious infections requiring hospitalization and parenteral
        antibiotic therapy. At least two weeks must elapse following the cessation of parenteral
        antibiotic therapy before study admission.
