      RATIONALE: Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and cyclophosphamide helps stem
      cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored.
      Chemotherapy and radiation therapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell
      transplant. The stem cells are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells
      that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cyclophosphamide plus filgrastim followed
      by stem cell transplant works in treating patients with chronic phase or accelerated phase
      chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the clinical outcomes, survival, and morbidity of patients with chronic or
           accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia when treated with cyclophosphamide and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine whether priming with cyclophosphamide and filgrastim (G-CSF) increases the
           fraction of benign Philadelphia chromosome negative hematopoietic progenitors in
           peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and reduces the incidence of persistent or recurrent
           leukemia after autologous transplantation with mobilized PBSC in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive priming therapy consisting of cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on
      day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) daily subcutaneously (SQ) starting on day 5 and continuing until
      completion of leukapheresis. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected between days
      14-21.

      Patients then receive preparative therapy for transplant consisting of cyclophosphamide IV
      over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 and total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 through -1.
      Patients receive the PBSC transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV starting
      on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients then receive interferon alfa SQ
      daily in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks; then at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months; and then annually for 5
      years.
