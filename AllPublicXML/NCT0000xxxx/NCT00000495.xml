  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether improved nutrition to correct overweight and high sodium intake, and
      regular frequent moderate rhythmic exercise to improve cardio-pulmonary fitness and to slow
      heart rate could lower blood pressure and prevent development of hypertension in
      hypertension-prone individuals.

      BACKGROUND:

      Diet modification is one of the strategies in the primary prevention of hypertension. Studies
      of the association between various factors and blood pressure in different populations have
      shown the occurrence of specific dietary factors associated with elevated blood pressures.
      The factors include overweight, alcohol consumption and high sodium intake. Heart rate is
      also an independent predictor of risk of hypertension. Diet and exercise are amenable to
      intervention to influence blood pressure with the aim of reducing the risk of developing
      hypertension.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In the first phase of the trial participants were randomized to a Monitored (Control) Group
      or to an Intervention Group receiving individualized intervention to achieve changes in diet
      and physical activity. The goals of the Intervention Group were: a reduction of at least 10
      pounds or 5 percent of body weight for those above desirable weight; a reduction in daily
      sodium intake to 1800 mg; a modification of alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per
      day; and an increase in regular, moderate physical activity. The primary endpoint in the
      first phase of the trial was the comparison of mean blood pressure in the Intervention Group
      versus the Monitored Group. In the second phase of the trial, all randomized participants
      were followed for a minimum of five years. The primary endpoints in the second phase were the
      incidence of high blood pressure and/or hypertension.
