    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma provide limited benefit to the
      patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove
      beneficial in the treatment of Low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous
      Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
      Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Low-grade
           Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete
           response, partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients with Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically proven stage II, III, or IV low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is
             unlikely to respond to existing therapy or for which no established therapy exists
             NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by
             PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
             terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol
             uses the former terminology.
