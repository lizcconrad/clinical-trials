      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to no antiviral therapy or intravenous ganciclovir every 12
      hours for 6 weeks.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1-4 and 12, months 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60, and yearly
      thereafter until puberty (when possible).
