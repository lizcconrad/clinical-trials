      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody anti-B1
      in patients with relapsed or refractory, low grade or transformed low grade B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: On day 1, patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody anti-B1 (MOAB anti-B1) IV
      over 1 hour followed by a tracer dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1 IV over 30 minutes to
      determine biodistribution and a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1. Patients
      receive unlabeled MOAB anti-B1 IV over 1 hour followed by a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131
      MOAB anti-B1 IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Patients are followed at weeks 13 and 25 and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Expanded Access Trial, no maximum accrual

    <description>Dosimetric Dose:Unlabeled anti-B1 (450mg) will be given as peripheral or central IV infusion over one hour or longer depending upon rate-dependent side effects. A trace-labeled dose of 131I-anti-B will be infused over 20 minutes, if rate-dependent side effects permit. An amount of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody is added to the 5 mCi of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody sufficient to result in a final amount of 35 mg of Anti-B1 antibody. On study Day 7 (may be delayed up to study Day 14), patients will receive the therapeutic dose, which consists of an infusion of 450mg of Anti-B1 Antibody followed by an infusion of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven relapsed or refractory, low grade or
        transformed low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including the following: Small
        lymphocytic Follicular small cleaved cell Follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell
        (less than 50% large cell component) Tumor must be positive for CD20 antigen Relapse or
        disease progression following at least 1 chemotherapy regimen or failure to achieve an
        objective response (complete or partial response) on prior chemotherapy regimen No disease
        progression, within 1 year of irradiation, arising in a field previously irradiated with
        more than 3500 cGy Mean of no greater than 25% intratrabecular marrow space involved with
        lymphoma on bilateral iliac crest bone marrow biopsy A new classification scheme for adult
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or
        &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or
        &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.

        normal (ULN) AST less than 5 times ULN Renal: Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN No active
        obstructive hydronephrosis Cardiovascular: No New York Heart Association class III or IV
        heart disease Other: No active infection requiring IV antibiotics No other concurrent
        illness that would preclude evaluation No prior malignancy within the past 5 years except
