  <brief_summary>

      To examine, in HIV-infected patients, the safety of allogeneic lymphocyte transfer (i.e.,
      infusion of white blood cells taken from an HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult offspring
      who has a compatible blood type). To measure the distribution and survival of allogeneic
      lymphocytes in the circulation of HIV-infected patients, and to determine whether their
      infusion results in enhanced immunity. To determine whether enhanced immunity is passively
      transferred or actively induced.

      There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the
      peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in
      some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However, more controlled
      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of
      therapy.

      There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the
      peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in
      some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However, more controlled
      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of
      therapy.

      Lymphocytes obtained by leukapheresis from a healthy, HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult
      offspring of the HIV-infected patient are infused at day 0 and at weeks 4 and 8. A small
      portion of the lymphocytes obtained at day 0 will be radiolabeled prior to infusion, and two
      total body scans will be performed. Patients also undergo two tonsillar biopsies. Patients
      are followed weekly for 16 weeks, then by telephone periodically for 3 years (at 1 year, 2
      years, 2.5 years, and 3 years).
