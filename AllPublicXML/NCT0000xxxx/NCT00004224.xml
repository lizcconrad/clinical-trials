      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy to
      see how well they work in treating children with localized ependymoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the event free and overall survival of children with incompletely resected
           localized ependymoma when treated with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
           vincristine followed by radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the response rate in these patients to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo surgery to remove as much of tumor as possible. Patients with residual
      disease proceed to chemotherapy, while those with no residual disease proceed directly to
      radiotherapy.

      Chemotherapy begins within 3 weeks of surgery and consists of vincristine IV on days 1, 8,
      and 15, cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on day 1, and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses. Patients who progress after 2 courses
      proceed to radiotherapy. If residual disease is still present at completion of chemotherapy,
      second look surgery is recommended.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy daily for 6 weeks beginning after complete resection within 4
      weeks of surgery, within 3 weeks of completion of chemotherapy, or within 4 weeks of second
      look surgery.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks after radiotherapy, every 2 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
