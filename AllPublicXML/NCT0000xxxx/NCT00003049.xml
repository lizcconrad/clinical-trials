      RATIONALE: Surgery to remove the pancreas, some of the small intestine, and lymph nodes may
      be more effective treatment for cancer of the pancreas than surgery to remove the pancreas
      and some of the small intestine alone. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy may be an
      effective treatment for cancer of the pancreas.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to remove the
      pancreas and a portion of the small intestine with or without removing lymph nodes, followed
      by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, in treating patients with cancer of the pancreas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the overall survival of patients with resectable ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma
           undergoing extended versus standard pancreatoduodenectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or PD with
      extended lymph node resection after an exploratory laparotomy.

      Patients receive adjuvant chemoradiation therapy 4-6 weeks after surgery, if no metastases
      are evident. Radiation therapy is given every week for 5 weeks. Fluorouracil/leucovorin
      calcium is administered by rapid IV push daily within 2 hours of radiation on days 1-4 of
      week 1 and days 29-31 of week 5.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be accrued per group for a total of 100 patients.
