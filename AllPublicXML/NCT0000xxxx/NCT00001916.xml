  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers would like to learn more about the low levels of bone mineral
      density seen in approximately half of women in their forties diagnosed as currently having or
      previously had depression.

      Bones are always undergoing a process of building (formation) and breakdown (resorption).
      This process is referred to as bone remodeling. When more bone is formed than resorbed, the
      density (level of calcium) in bone increases and the bones become stronger. However, if more
      bone is resorbed than formed the density of bone decreases and the bones become weak. This
      condition is called osteoporosis.

      It is unknown if women with depression have decreased bone mineral density as a result of too
      much breakdown of bone or not enough building. It is important to know the cause of low bone
      mineral density because it will influence the way a patient is treated. Medications like
      bisphosphonates are used when there is too much bone breakdown. Growth hormone replacement
      can be given in cases where there is not enough bone production. Presently, bone biopsy and a
      procedure known as histomorphometry can determine what processes are going on in bones.

      Researchers have decided to use a sample of bone (biopsy) from part of the hip bone (iliac
      crest). In addition, researchers will collect a sample of bone marrow (the soft tissue found
      in the center of bones) to tell them more about the biochemical, cellular, and molecular
      processes that may be contributing to the problem of decreased bone density in depressed
      premenopausal women.

      We have recently found that premenopausal women with past or current depression show
      clinically significant decrements in bone mineral density in the hip and spine, rendering
      more than 40% at present risk for osteoporotic fracture. Recent pharmacologic advances
      provide the opportunity to ameliorate or reverse this clinically significant loss of bone
      mineral density. Available agents such as bisphosphonates or growth hormone are each
      preferentially effective in the contexts of increased and decreased bone turnover,
      respectively. It is currently not known whether the decrease in bone mineral density in
      depression is associated with increased or decreased bone turnover because the many endocrine
      changes associated with depression of possible relevance to decreased bone mineral density
      have disparate effects on bone turnover dynamics. At present, the only definitive way to
      determine the status of bone turnover in humans is via bone biopsy and histomorphometric
      evaluation. In addition, bone marrow routinely obtained during standard bone biopsy would
      provide the opportunity to culture osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cells to determine
      possible abnormalities in differentiation and function as a means of exploring the cellular
      and molecular mechanisms of decreased bone mineral density in depression. In light of the
      high incidence of depression in women, decreased bone mineral density in patients with past
      or current depression has considerable public health implications.

      <textblock>
        Female patients with primary affective disorder (major depression n=17).

        Controls must not have psychiatric disorders.

        Subjects with past or current depression will be studied if bone mineral density in any
        site in either hip or spine was assessed by DEXA scan to be equal to or greater than 1 1/2
        standard deviation below peak bone density.

        Subjects with psychiatric illness can either be drug free or receiving any FDA approved
        medication for the treatment of depression, with the exception of valproic acid and
        carbamazepine, which are known to interfere with intestinal calcium absorption (and hence,
        can influence bone mineral density), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which can interact
        adversely with fentanyl in the event that it would be given for relief of pain.

        During the course of the entire study all subjects must abstain from tobacco and alcohol
        and will be instructed to inform the physicians conducting the research about their use of
        prescription or non-prescription medication, including birth control pills.

        Must not have any serious medical illnesses.

        Must not have current or past, prolonged steroid use.

        Must not be pregnant.

        Must not be on anticoagulant medication.

        Must not be allergic to or have shown adverse reactions to tetracyline, benzodiazepines,
        fentanyl, or lidocaine.

        Must not have used aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the past
        week.
