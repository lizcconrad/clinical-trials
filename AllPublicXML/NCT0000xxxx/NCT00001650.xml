  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes reproduce and
      how long they live in people infected with HIV. It will do this using bromodeoxyuridine
      (BrDU), a compound that is structurally similar to thymidine, one of the building blocks of
      DNA. BrDU gets incorporated into DNA instead of thymidine, but it can only get into cells
      that are replicating. Therefore, measuring the proportion of cells with BrDU indicates how
      many cells are replicating.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram
      (EKG) and blood tests.

      Participants will be given an infusion of BrDU through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed
      in an arm vein. Blood will be drawn up to 4 times in the first 24 hours after the infusion.

      Additional samples will then be collected as often as daily for the first week, twice a week
      for the next 3 weeks and then weekly to monthly for up to 1 year. Some patients may undergo a
      tissue biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample from a lymph node, tonsil or colon) or
      computed tomography (CT) scans of the thymus (a small gland between the lungs that
      manufactures lymphocytes. Some patients will have a second infusion in order to examine
      changes in the rate of CD4 replication over time or following potent antiretroviral therapy.
      Patients will be followed in the clinic periodically for the first year and then will be seen
      in the clinic or contacted by telephone once a year for 4 more years.

      The results of this study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and
      how therapy affects the immune system.

    <textblock>
      Understanding the rate of lymphocyte replication and destruction in HIV infected patients, as
      well as the effects of therapy on lymphocyte replication should lead to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the immunodeficiency induced by HIV. To examine this
      directly, up to 85 HIV-infected patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive
      up to two 30 minute infusions (at least one month apart) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU; 200
      mg/m(2)), an analogue of thymidine. BrDU is incorporated into DNA and can be measured using
      an anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody. It can be measured in subpopulations of cells to determine
      the rate of replication of those cells. All participants in this study will be reimbursed for
      the inconvenience and discomfort associated with study participation.
