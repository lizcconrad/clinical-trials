      RATIONALE: Mistletoe lectin may slow the growth of cancer cells and be an effective treatment
      for solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of mistletoe lectin in treating patients
      who have refractory advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of mistletoe lectin
           (recombinant viscumin) in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard
           therapy.

        -  Determine the optimal biologically active dose of mistletoe lectin based on analysis of
           specific biological surrogate markers, including plasma cytokine levels and peripheral
           counts of activated immune cells and immunological stimulation at the RNA level of the
           immune cells.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether induction of antibodies against mistletoe lectin occurs in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether modification of endothelial parameters occurs in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive mistletoe lectin (recombinant viscumin) subcutaneously twice weekly. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of mistletoe lectin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the
      highest dose level immediately preceding the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
