      To study three possible, but yet unproven, influences on pediatric asthma hospitalization
      rates - diagnostic substitution, different systems of medical care, and asthma medication
      use.

      BACKGROUND:

      Recent research has shown that asthma admission rates for children vary widely across
      geographic areas and have increased nationally for the past decade. The results from these
      studies will have direct relevance to the clinical care and development of public policy for
      children with asthma.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Specific hypotheses regarding these factors which influence pediatric asthma hospitalization
      were tested in two different data sets: ecologic studies of trends and area variations of the
      children residing in the contiguous states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont for 1980 -
      1994; retrospective cohort analyses of children enrolled at a staff model HMO, Group Health
      Cooperative of Puget Sound for 1977 - 1994. These studies utilized detailed information
      regarding area and individual 'exposure' to differing systems of health care and asthma
      medications, controlling for socioeconomic status.
