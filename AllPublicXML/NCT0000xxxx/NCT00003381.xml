      RATIONALE: Questionnaires that measure quality of life during treatment may improve the
      ability to plan treatment for patients with esophageal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the quality of life in patients receiving treatment
      for esophageal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer randomized on
      protocol CALGB C9781 to treatment with surgery alone vs trimodal therapy combining
      preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in addition to surgery. II. Examine the
      incremental cost and cost effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in
      the treatment of esophageal cancer. III. Examine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted
      life year (QALY) of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of
      esophageal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a companion study to CALGB C9781, a phase III randomized study. Prior to
      treatment on CALGB C9781, patients complete forms assessing quality of life, psychological
      functioning, specific areas of dysfunction, resource use, and time lost from work; subsequent
      assessments are completed by telephone interview at 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the
      initiation of study treatment, regardless of disease status (patients with hearing impairment
      and those speaking only a translatable foreign language may mail responses). Patients also
      keep a diary of medical resource utilization at sites other than the treating institution.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Patients with histologically documented untreated squamous cell carcinoma or
             adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (below 20 cm) or gastroesophageal junction
             and with less than 2cmdistal spread into the gastric cardia eligible for C9781.

          2. There could be no evidence of distant metastatic disease by history and physical
             examination; upper endoscopy with biopsy, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and
             upper abdomen, and pulmonary function studies were all required.

          3. Tumors had to be considered surgically resectable (T1-3, NX), including regional
             thoracic lymph node (N1) metastases.

          4. Patients with supraclavicular lymph nodes measuring ≤1.5 cm by CT (not palpable) were
             eligible, as were patients with lymph node metastases to levels 15 to 20
             (predominantly celiac axis and paracardial nodes) ≤ 1.5 cm by CT.

          5. Patients could not have previously received chemotherapy or radiation therapy for this
             tumor or any radiation therapy that would overlap the radiation fields required for
             this malignancy. Patients with previous malignancies were eligible if more than 5
             years had elapsed from diagnosis without evidence of tumor recurrence.

          6. There could be no other serious illness that would limit survival to less than 2
             years, or psychiatric condition that would prevent compliance with treatment or
             informed consent.

          7. Patients with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or
             active infections were excluded, as were pregnant patients.
