      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating women who have
      advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the therapeutic activity of temozolomide in terms of tumor response,
      progression free and overall survival in women with advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the
      extent of ATase depletion and DNA methylation in the peripheral blood of these patients
      undergoing this regimen and investigate the relationship between these parameters and tumor
      response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide every 4 hours for a total of 5 doses. Treatment
      continues every 28 days for a minimum of 2 courses and a maximum of 1 year in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed at 30 days, and then
      every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
