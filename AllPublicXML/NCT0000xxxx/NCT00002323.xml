      PRIMARY: To compare the virologic activity (quantitative RNA PCR, quantitative PBMC) of the
      combination of nevirapine and zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone after 3 and 6 months of
      treatment. To compare the effects of these two regimens on CD4 T-cell count and percentage.

      SECONDARY: To compare and evaluate other markers of immunologic and virologic activity in
      patients receiving nevirapine/AZT versus AZT alone. To compare the effects of the two
      regimens on clinical signs and symptoms. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of the two
      regimens.
