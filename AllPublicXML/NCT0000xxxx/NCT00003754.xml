      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may kill tumor cells by stopping the growth of new blood vessels to
      the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining thalidomide and
      cyclophosphamide in treating children who have recurrent or refractory childhood cancers.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and toxic effects of thalidomide and cyclophosphamide
      in patients with recurrent or refractory pediatric malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide 4 times daily. Cyclophosphamide is administered IV
      over 1 hour once every 4 weeks, beginning on the same day as thalidomide. Treatment continues
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor response is assessed
      every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
