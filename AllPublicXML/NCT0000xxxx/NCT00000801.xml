      To estimate the response rate, overall and disease-free survival, toxicities, factors
      associated with outcome, and effect on quality of life in patients with AIDS-related primary
      CNS lymphoma treated with CHOD (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      dexamethasone) plus filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) and external
      beam irradiation. To determine other clinical markers present in this patient population.

      Combined modality therapy may prove of benefit for patients with AIDS-related primary CNS
      lymphoma.

      Combined modality therapy may prove of benefit for patients with AIDS-related primary CNS
      lymphoma.

      Patients who upon staging workup are found to be without systemic involvement undergo one
      cycle of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, and
      G-CSF. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are administered intravenously on day
      1. Dexamethasone is administered intravenously on day 1 and then orally thereafter with
      gradual discontinuation. G-CSF is administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 2 and
      continuing for a total of 10 days or until blood counts have recovered to an acceptable
      level. Patients with evidence of cancer cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will receive
      chemotherapy with intrathecal cytarabine twice weekly until no further evidence of cancer
      cells is found in the CSF, then once weekly for 6 weeks, and then monthly for 10 months.
      Seven to ten days following completion of one cycle of chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radiotherapy to the brain at a dose of 2.5 Gy daily for 5 days per week for approximately 4
      weeks. Total dose to the whole brain and meninges is 30.0 Gy in 12 fractions, and total dose
      to the primary boost volume is 10.0 Gy in 4 fractions. During therapy, blood is drawn weekly
      and brain scans are performed every 3-12 weeks. An initial CSF sample will be obtained by
      lumbar puncture.
