      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bleomycin in treating patients with
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate, response duration and survival of
      patients receiving bleomycin as salvage therapy for AIDS-related or immunocompetent
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the feasibility and toxicity of treatment for this
      disease. III. Evaluate the quality of life of AIDS and non-AIDS patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, prior
      radiotherapy, and HIV/AIDS status. Patients receive bleomycin by continuous infusion for 72
      hours every 3 weeks. Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles. Patients who achieve complete
      remission receive 2 more cycles. Patients with partial remission or stable disease may
      continue therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Quality of life
      assessments are conducted at beginning of therapy, every 3 weeks, and at completion of
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent intermediate or high grade
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) AIDS-related NHL eligible At least 1 evaluable or measurable
        disease as defined by the following: Radiographic findings are acceptable Bidimensionally
        measurable defect on a computed tomographic (CT) scan Clearly defined abdominal masses on
        CT scans Enlarged spleen and/or liver extending at least 5 cm below the costal margin
        Biopsy proven lymphomatous hepatic involvement No clinical or radiographic evidence of
        parenchymal CNS involvement by lymphoma (meningeal lymphoma permitted) A new classification
        scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of
        &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;,
        &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: ECOG 0-3 Life expectancy: At
        least 6 weeks Hematopoietic: WBC at least 1500/mm3 Platelet count at least 50,000/mm3
        Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 3.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater than 3.0 mg/dL
        Other: May be HIV positive Immunocompetent (HIV-seronegative) NHL patients must be suitable
        candidates for bleomycin chemotherapy Active infections undergoing drug treatment allowed
        Negative head CT/MRI scan

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 1 prior
        systemic chemotherapy regimen Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: Prior
        radiation therapy for localized stage I/II disease that has progressed beyond initial
        radiation therapy port is allowed Surgery: Not specified Other: Concurrent zidovudine,
        didanosine, or zalcitabine therapy allowed
