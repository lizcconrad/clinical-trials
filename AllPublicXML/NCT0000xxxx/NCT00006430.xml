      Purpose: This protocol proposes a safety and feasibility trial in patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer (stages D1-D3) investigating the induction of antitumor immunity by
      administration of cultured autologous peripheral blood precursor derived dendritic cells
      (DC), transfected with mRNA amplified from autologous prostate tumor tissue. The feasibility
      and dose-limiting toxicity of administering escalating doses of tumor RNA transfected
      dendritic cells will be defined. As a secondary endpoint, the ability of tumor RNA
      transfected dendritic cells to induce tumor-specific immune responses will be evaluated.
      Finally, the anti-tumor effect based on PSA (biochemical) response criteria will be defined.

      Background: Because prostate cancer is incurable when metastatic and conventional therapies
      do not offer a clear survival benefit, new therapeutic strategies are warranted. This study
      is based on the premise that clinically effective cell mediated immune responses against
      prostate tumors can be elicited by activation of tumor associated antigen specific T cells.
      Work performed by others and our group suggests that PSA, a protein expressed in virtually
      all prostate cancers, can serve as a widely expressed candidate antigen for prostate cancer
      immunotherapy. In particular, we have shown that cultured dendritic cells transfected with
      mRNA encoding PSA are remarkably effective in stimulating antigen specific immunity in vitro.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that administration of PSA RNA transfected DC will lead to
      detectable levels of PSA specific CTL in the peripheral blood of patients with PSA expressing
      metastatic prostate cancer. It is hoped that these T cell responses also have clinical
      antitumor activity.

      Methods: Patients will undergo percutaneous needle biopsies from either primary or metastatic
      sites to obtain tumor tissue. Patients in whom sufficient tumor mRNA has been amplified by
      PCR to transfect the assigned dendritic cell dose will undergo leukapheresis and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells will be cultured in vitro for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-4 to generate
      precursor derived dendritic cells. Dendritic cells will then be cryopreserved for later use.
      On the day the patient returns to receive his infusion (weeks 0, 2, and 4) the dendritic
      cells will be thawed, reconstituted, and transfected with amplified total tumor mRNA.
      Patients will receive a total of 3 treatments consisting of combined I.V. and I.D.
      injections, each on study week 0, 2, and 4. Repeat leukapheresis will be performed 2 weeks
      after the last dose to determine immune function. PSA levels will be measured prior to the
      start of treatment and 2 weeks following the last infusion. Patients who do not receive
      therapy due to a failure to produce sufficient RNA or dendritic cells will be replaced in
      order to assess toxicity.

      Data Analysis: 1. To determine the short and long term toxicities associated with
      administration of tumor RNA dendritic cells in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. 2.
      To determine feasibility of dendritic cell vaccine generation according to the proportion of
      patients for whom sufficient cells are generated to provide treatment. 3. To determine the
      cellular immune response to intravenous infusion of tumor RNA dendritic cells. 4. To measure
      the PSA response of patients with metastatic prostate cancer to intravenous infusion of tumor
      RNA dendritic cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a histologic or clinically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (Stage
             D1-D3 metastatic with regional lymphatic, bone, visceral, or soft tissue metastases).
             (Transitional cell and small cell carcinomas of prostate origin are excluded.)

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 months

          -  The patient has adequate hematologic function with: WBC&gt;=3000mm3, Hemoglobin&gt;=9mg/dl,
             Platelets&gt;=100,000/mm3
