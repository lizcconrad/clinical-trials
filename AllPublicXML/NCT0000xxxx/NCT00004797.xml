      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of fructose administered every 6 hours
      for up to 72 hours to patients in active sickle cell crisis.

      II. Obtain tolerability information in selected patients treated with fructose for more than
      72 hours.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: In the first part of the study, patients are block-randomized (3:1) to a
      single intravenous dose of fructose or placebo. The dose of fructose is escalated in each
      successive group after tolerability data are evaluated.

      In the second part of the study, patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to fructose or placebo
      administered intravenously every 6 hours for 72 hours. The dose of fructose is the highest
      well-tolerated dose determined in Study 1 or the most tolerated dose for the patient.
      Patients who just completed Study 1 may participate if they are clearly in a separate crisis
      and continue to meet entry criteria.

      Patients whose symptoms persist for more than 72 hours after fructose or placebo are eligible
      to receive additional fructose every 6 hours until symptoms subside.
