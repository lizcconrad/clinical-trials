  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is used by the Digestive Diseases Branch to evaluate patients with suspected
      abnormalities in the secretion of gastric acid. The level of gastric acid is measured by
      analyzing the gastric juices of each individual patient. The gastric acid sample is obtained
      by a procedure known as nasogastric suctioning, where a thin plastic tube is passed from the
      nose to the stomach.

      Depending on the patient's present condition further diagnostic testing may be required to
      achieve a diagnosis.

      This study is an omnibus protocol used by the Digestive Diseases Branch to evaluate patients
      with suspected abnormalities of gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion is measured by
      means of analysis of gastric juices obtained by nasogastric suction. Other clinically
      indicated diagnostic procedures are performed depending on the patient's clinical state in
      order to reach a diagnosis.
