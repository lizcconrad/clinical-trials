  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will continue to treat and collect safety and efficacy data on patients who
      participated in Glaxo-Wellcome's multi-center study on combination therapy with abacavir,
      amprenavir and efavirenz (A Phase II Study Evaluating the Safety and Antiviral Activity of
      Combination Therapy with 1592U89, 141W94 and DMP 266 (Sustiva) in HIV-1 Infected Subjects
      with Detectable [greater than 400 Copies/mL] HIV-1 Plasma RNA Despite Treatment with a
      Protease Inhibitor-Containing Regimen).

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who participated in the above study at the
      NIH site may be eligible for the current study. Participants will be followed every 3 months
      with a general health evaluation and laboratory tests. This is a NIH study, and information
      will not be provided to Glaxo Wellcome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, single-arm study, HIV-1 infected patients who had, at study entry, a
      viral burden of at least 500 copies/mL despite 20 weeks of treatment with a protease
      inhibitor receive combination therapy with three antiretroviral agents that were
      investigational at the start of study but have since been approved: abacavir, amprenavir, and
      efavirenz. At the end of 16 weeks, the addition of other antiretroviral agents to the study
      regimen was permitted. This was originally a multi-center study, but it has been closed at
      all other sites. It remains open at the NIH to continue to provide therapy to subjects who
      have received benefit as determined by a decline in viral load from baseline. Safety and
      viral load data continue to be collected.

        INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects who were previously enrolled in this protocol when it was a multi-center study and
        who signed the new informed consent were enrolled. There has been and will be no other new
        enrollment. Thus, subjects who were not previously enrolled are excluded.

        Subjects are adults infected with HIV-1 who had, prior to study enrollment, a plasma viral
        load of at least 500 copies/mL despite at least 20 weeks of treatment with a protease
        inhibitor and without change in protease inhibitor therapy in the 12 weeks prior to
        enrollment.
