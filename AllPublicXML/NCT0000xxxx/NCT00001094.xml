      To compare the long-term virologic response to combination therapy with two protease
      inhibitors, i.e., nelfinavir (NFV) + saquinavir soft gel capsule (SQVsgc) and delavirdine
      (DLV) or combination lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV, Combivir) versus NFV and 3TC/ZDV, in the
      proportion of patients demonstrating virologic success (&lt; 500 copies/ml HIV RNA) at week 48,
      without prior virologic or clinical failure. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of
      combination protease inhibitors.

      To evaluate the durability of virologic response as assessed by the Roche Ultra Sensitive
      assay (&lt; 200 copies/ml) and culturable virus. To compare time to a confirmed virologic
      response (two consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels &lt; 500 copies/ml) or to a confirmed treatment
      relapse following a confirmed virologic response across the treatment arms. To evaluate
      biologic phenotype (non-syncytium inducing versus syncytium inducing capacity) and the
      evolution and patterns of viral resistance among patients with confirmed treatment failures
      at or after weeks 16 to 24. To compare immunologic benefits, as measured by longitudinal
      CD4/CD8 cell count profiles. To evaluate the influence of baseline virologic and immunologic
      parameters on the magnitude and duration of plasma HIV RNA response. To compare virologic
      response between the two dose schedules of NFV and SQVsgc (bid vs tid) and between NFV and
      SQVsgc with either DLV or combination 3TC/ZDV. To evaluate compliance and exploratory
      population pharmacometrics.

      Past studies have shown that combination therapies not only will result in better clinical
      outcomes but may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination
      therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of HIV replication and alterations in
      resistance patterns. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that triple-drug therapy may
      have an advantage over one- and two-drug regimens. Therefore, triple-drug therapy appears to
      be an important strategy in the treatment of HIV infection.

      This is a Phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label trial of NFV + SQVsgc and either DLV
      or combined 3TC/ZDV versus NFV and combined 3TC/ZDV. Prior to randomization, patients are
      stratified by HIV RNA (above or below 65,000 copies/ml) and by prior antiretroviral therapy
      (no therapy vs any therapy). Patients (100 patients/arm) are then randomly assigned to one of
      four arms. Arm I receives NFV plus combination 3TC/ZDV. Arm II receives NFV plus SQVsgc plus
      combination 3TC/ZDV. Arm III receives NFV plus SQVsgc plus DLV. Arm IV receives NFV plus
      SQVsgc plus DLV. Treatment continues for 48 weeks following enrollment of the last patient.
      Response to treatment is assessed at week 16. Patients with confirmed plasma HIV RNA levels
      &gt;= 500 copies/ml at week 16 whose plasma HIV RNA has decreased since study entry (day 0) may
      continue therapy and be reassessed at weeks 20 and 24. Patients considered treatment failures
      (i.e., 2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels &gt;= 500 copies/ml at or after week 16) or who have
      relapsed may register to Step 2 treatment (addition of at least 2 new drugs to their prior
      treatment regimen), enroll in another ACTG protocol at time of failure, or seek the best
      available therapy while continuing to be followed for remainder of study.
