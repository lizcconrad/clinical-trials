      RATIONALE: Biological therapy uses different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Cytotoxic T cells combined with interleukin-2 may be an effective
      treatment for recurrent brain tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cytotoxic T cells and interleukin-2 in
      treating adults with recurrent brain tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicity of allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) when
      repeatedly instilled directly into the brain to treat recurrent primary brain tumors. II.
      Evaluate the response produced by allogeneic CTL and interleukin-2. III. Correlate CTL
      surface phenotype and degree of patient/donor HLA mismatch to response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Surgery plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Tumor resection; plus
      intracavitary cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTL; intracavitary Interleukin-2 (Chiron), IL-2,
      NSC-373364. CTL are generated in vitro by mixing irradiated patient lymphocytes (cultured
      with IL-2 and Monoclonal Antibody OKT 3, MOAB OKT 3, NSC-618843) with allogeneic lymphocytes
      and culturing the mixture with IL-2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 10 patients will be treated. If severe toxicity occurs in the first 5
      patients, the study will close.
