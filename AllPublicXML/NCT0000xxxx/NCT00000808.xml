  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety and tolerance of
      nevirapine in HIV-1 infected pregnant women and their newborns when nevirapine is given to
      the mother during active labor, and when their neonates are dosed during the first week of
      life. To determine the short-term safety profile of mothers receiving zidovudine (AZT) who
      received nevirapine during active labor, and their neonates who received no dose, a single
      dose, or multiple doses of nevirapine and who are receiving AZT during the first 6 weeks of
      life.

      Treatment of HIV-1 infected pregnant women during active labor may result in therapeutic
      levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition,
      decreasing the neonate's risk of infection.

      Treatment of HIV-1 infected pregnant women during active labor may result in therapeutic
      levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition,
      decreasing the neonate's risk of infection.

      Pregnant women in active labor receive single doses of oral nevirapine. The neonates of the
      first 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) mothers receive no drug, while the neonates of the
      second 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) patient cohort receive a single dose of nevirapine.
      If neonatal antiviral levels of nevirapine are not sustained for 7 days after the single
      dose, a third cohort of 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) pregnant women will receive a
      single dose of nevirapine and their neonates will receive multiple doses of nevirapine to
      maintain an antiviral effect for 7 days.
