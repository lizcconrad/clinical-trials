      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of bryostatin 1 in patients with myelodysplastic
      syndrome. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1. III.
      Determine the duration of response and survival of patients receiving this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a two stage study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous infusion over
      72 hours every 14 days for 4 cycles. Responding patients may continue treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response
      receive 2 additional cycles. Patients with no response receive 4 additional cycles. Patients
      are re-evaluated after every 4 cycles.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 to 27 patients will be accrued within 2 years into this 2 stage study.
