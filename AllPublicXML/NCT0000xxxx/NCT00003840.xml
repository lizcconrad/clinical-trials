      RATIONALE: DTGM fusion protein may be able to locate cancer cells and stop them from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of DTGM fusion protein in treating
      patients who have recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DTGM fusion protein in patients with
      recurrent or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic
      effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Measure the pharmacokinetics of this regimen
      in these patients. IV. Evaluate the response rate at the maximum tolerated dose and immune
      responses in patients treated with this regimen. V. Correlate in vitro sensitivity of
      leukemic blasts to this regimen with the response rate in these patients. VI. Correlate tumor
      necrosis factor genetic polymorphisms with toxicity profiles and dose-limiting toxic effects
      of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to serum level of
      anti-DTGM antibody titer (2 mg/L or less vs greater than 2 mg/L). Patients receive DTGM
      fusion protein IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Patients with a partial response are eligible
      for retreatment. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTGM fusion protein
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the
      MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with DTGM fusion
      protein at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
