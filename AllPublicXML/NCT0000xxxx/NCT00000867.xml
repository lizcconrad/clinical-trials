  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of memantine, an
      experimental drug, in improving AIDS dementia complex (ADC).

      The symptoms of ADC can be improved with zidovudine (ZDV). However, ZDV therapy has been
      associated with significant toxicities, and the effectiveness of ZDV seems to decrease during
      the second and third years of therapy. The effectiveness of other antiretroviral drugs as
      treatment for ADC is not known, so it is important to explore alternative therapies.

    <textblock>
      The signs and symptoms of the AIDS Dementia Complex can be alleviated by zidovudine (ZDV).
      However, ZDV therapy has been associated with significant toxicities, particularly bone
      marrow suppression. The efficacy of ZDV appears to decrease during the second and third years
      of therapy. It is not known whether this reflects cumulative toxicity. In addition, the
      efficacy of other antiretroviral agents remains uncertain. Hence, adjunctive therapy for
      cognitive and motor symptoms of AIDS is important.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the following 2 arms:

      Arm 1 receives memantine plus concurrent antiretroviral therapy; Arm 2 receives placebo plus
      concurrent antiretroviral therapy. The initial dose of memantine is increased each week for
      the next 3 weeks, unless a maximum tolerated dose is reached. Following a 16-week evaluation
      period there is a 4-week washout prior to re-assessment. After the washout period, all
      patients, including those formerly randomized to the placebo arm, are given the opportunity
      to receive an open-label, 12-week administration of memantine. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/6/99: The
      open-label phase is extended by 48 weeks to a total of 60 weeks of therapy. Patients who did
      not receive the initial 12 weeks of open-label treatment are eligible still for the 48-week
      open-label treatment phase.]
