      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of heme arginate, singly or in combination with tin
      mesoporphyrin, in lowering porphyrin precursors in patients with asymptomatic acute
      intermittent porphyria.

      II. Evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of these treatment regimens in this
      patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an unblinded, dose ranging study. Patients receive heme arginate
      alone or in combination with tin mesoporphyrin.

      Patients receive tin mesoporphyrin IV as a single dose. Heme arginate is administered as a
      single intravenous infusion.

      Patients are entered in cohorts of 4. Subsequent cohorts of 4 patients each receive
      escalating doses of tin mesoporphyrin in combination with 1 of 2 different dosages of heme
      arginate. Subjects must maintain a constant diet.

      Patients experiencing adverse reactions are followed as clinically indicated.
