      RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs such as granisetron may help to prevent nausea and vomiting in
      patients treated with chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of granisetron with that of
      a placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy in patients who have malignant
      disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy and safety of oral granisetron versus placebo in
      preventing nausea and vomiting during the 48 hours that begins 24 hours after administration
      of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with
      malignant disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      granisetron on day 0 at 60 minutes prior to the scheduled administration of IV
      cyclophosphamide or carboplatin (or doxorubicin) chemotherapy. On days 1 and 2, patients
      receive oral granisetron at approximately the same time as on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive
      oral granisetron on day 0 as in arm I. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral placebo at
      approximately the same time as the granisetron tablets were taken on day 0. Patients are
      followed between 5 and 11 days after the last dose of study medication.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 434 patients (217 per arm) will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of malignant disease eligible for chemotherapy Scheduled
        to receive a regimen of chemotherapy containing IV cyclophosphamide or carboplatin, with or
        without other chemotherapy agents Cyclophosphamide must be given at a dose of 500-1,200
        mg/m2 Carboplatin must be given at a dose of at least 300 mg/m2 unless Calvert dosing
        equation (using target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min) requires less than 300 mg/m2 Doxorubicin, if
        given, must be infused within a period not exceeding 1 hour Minimum doses are to be based
        on actual body weight Other emetogenic or nonemetogenic agents are permitted to be included
        in the day 0 chemotherapy regimen without restriction on dose Emetogenic agents must be
        given as part of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based regimen on day 0 and not at
        another time within the 72 hour period Cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, or doxorubicin must
        be the first emetogenic agent given No cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
        prednisone (CHOP) regimen No primary or secondary (from metastatic disease) brain neoplasm
        with: Signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure OR Brain metastases requiring
