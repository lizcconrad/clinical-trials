      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have advanced,
      metastatic, or recurrent soft tissue sarcomas. SU5416 may stop the growth of soft tissue
      sarcomas by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival in patients with
      advanced, metastatic, or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor when
      treated with SU5416.

      II. Determine the safety of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive SU5416 IV twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for 1 year.
