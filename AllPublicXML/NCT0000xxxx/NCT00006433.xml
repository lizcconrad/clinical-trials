      Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the combination of Doxil chemotherapy
      and heat treatment for recurrent breast cancer located on the chestwall following mastectomy.
      This protocol also includes patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not had
      mastectomy but have advanced tumor remaining within the breast. Doxil is the drug adriamycin
      (also called doxorubicin) encapsulated in liposomes, which coats the drug with a small amount
      of lipid (fat). This chemotherapy is in a newer form which can be better delivered to the
      tumor tissue without causing as much systemic toxicity. We are combining heat treatment with
      this drug in an effort to further increase the delivery of drug to the tumor, which may give
      an increased tumor response.

      Methods: The patients will be treated with chemotherapy followed by heat treatment. This will
      be given for 6 cycles approximately every 4 weeks. For the first cycle patients will need to
      be hospitalized 3 days for measurement of blood levels of drug as well as some additional
      radiology studies which will help us to determine whether the drug is preferentially
      distributed within tumor.
