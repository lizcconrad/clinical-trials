      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who
      have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the activity of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with progressive
      androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer. II. Study HER2 status by
      immunohistochemistry on prostate cancer biopsy samples. III. Study associations between HER2
      protein expression on tumor cells and post-therapy changes in PSA in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 or 90 minutes once a week. Treatment
      continues for a maximum of 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients are followed for time to progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically documented androgen dependent or independent
        prostate cancer Progressive disease on primary hormonal treatment (e.g., orchiectomy,
        estrogen therapy, gonadotropin releasing hormone analog with or without an antiandrogen)
        New osseous lesions by bone scan OR 25% increase in bidimensionally measurable soft tissue
        disease or appearance of new sites of disease by MRI or CT scan If initial hormonal
        treatment was a combined androgen blockade approach, must show progression off of the
        antiandrogen Minimum of 3 rising PSA values from baseline obtained 1 week or more apart OR
        2 rising PSA values obtained 2 or more weeks apart PSA at least 4 ng/mL Testosterone no
        greater than 30 ng/mL No active CNS or epidural tumor

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 70-100% Life

        with no evidence of ventricular aneurysm or other abnormal wall motion OR SESTAMIBI stress
        test must show fixed defect alone if ejection fraction less than 45%, or a worrisome but
        nonexclusive cardiovascular history, or an abnormal ECG Pulmonary: No severe pulmonary
        disease Other: Fertile patients must use effective contraception No history of an active
        secondary malignancy with the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer No infection
        requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment No other severe medical problem that would
        increase the risk for toxicity

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy: At
        least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine
