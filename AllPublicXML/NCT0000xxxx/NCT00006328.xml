  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to help doctors learn about the relationships between specific genetic
      makeup (gene markers) and the development of chronic rejection. This study is being done to
      see if there is a relationship between genetic patterns and the development of Chronic
      Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Medical scientists also hope to learn more about how genetic
      differences between people determine their response to a drug or a disease by storing a small
      blood sample in a special &quot;bank&quot;. This sample may be tested at some point in the future in an
      attempt to better understand the factors that may influence rejection, transplantation
      outcomes and transplant success rates.
