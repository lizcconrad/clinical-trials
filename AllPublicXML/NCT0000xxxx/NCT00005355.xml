      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Models were developed which allowed for sex difference in the expression of autosomal
      polygenes, differences in the impact of the paternal and maternal environment on male and
      female offspring, and for the complex consequences of assortative mating on the correlations
      among loci and between genes and environment. Computer simulations were used to decide which
      kinds of gender-dependent effects could be resolved with particular constellations of
      relatives, and to address problems of power and bias resulting from errors of
      model-specification. The methods developed were applied to data from extensive data already
      gathered from twins and their relatives to determine the importance of sex differences in
      genetic and environmental causes of variation in measured aspects of cardiovascular risk
      including weight, body-mass index, family history of CV disease, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, exercise, diet, psychosocial variables and lifestyle.
