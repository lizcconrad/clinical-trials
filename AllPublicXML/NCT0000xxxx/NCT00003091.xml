      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may
      stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer or melanoma cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose interferon alfa and
      interleukin-2 in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer or melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and antitumor activity of high dose interferon
      alfa-2b and interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. II.
      Determine the toxic effects of interferon alfa-2b and interleukin-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b on
      days 1-4. Patients are hospitalized and receive bolus infusions of interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      followed by a continuous infusion on days 5-7. Patients are observed at least 12 hours
      following IL-2 treatment. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks until disease progression or up
      to a maximum of six cycles. Patients are followed every 2 months for one year, then for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 response is seen in the first 14 patients in each group, a
      maximum of 40 patients per group will be accrued.
