  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with hematological malignancies potentially curable by bone marrow
      transplantation are not considered for transplantation because an HLA identical family or
      unrelated donor is unavailable. For these patients the only curative option is a transplant
      from a partially matched family donor. Such transplants are feasible but are less successful
      than matched sibling donor transplants. The main problems with mismatched transplants are
      graft rejection, graft-vs-host disease, and regimen-related mortality. This restricts the use
      of mismatched transplants to patients less than 45 years at high risk of dying from the
      hematological malignancy.

      This protocol evaluates a new preparative regimen designed to ensure stem cell engraftment by
      increased immunosuppression, followed by a G-CSF mobilized T cell depleted, stem cell rich,
      peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplant from a mismatched related donor in
      patients with high risk hematological malignancies.

      This phase I study evaluates engraftment and GVHD following T cell depleted, HLA-mismatched
      PBPC transplants. Stopping rules will be used to make modifications to the protocol in the
      event of graft failure.

      The end points of the study are graft take, acute and chronic GVHD, leukemic relapse,
      transplant-related mortality, death and leukemia-free survival. Patients will be followed up
      for 5 years. It is planned to treat up to 35 patients aged between 10 and 45 years.

        Patient:

        Ages 10-45 years.

        Chronic myelogenous leukemia, any of these categories: accelerated phase or blast
        transformation.

        Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, any of these categories: Adults (greater than 18 years) in
        any remission with high-risk features (presenting leukocyte count greater than 100,000/cu
        mm, Karyotypes t9; 22, t4, t19, t11, biphenotypic leukemia). All second remissions, primary
        induction failure including partial remission, partially responding or untreated relapse.

        Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML): All AML in second or subsequent remission, primary
        induction failure or partial remission and resistant relapse.

        Myelodysplastic syndromes, any of these categories: refractory anemia with excess of
        blasts, transformation to acute leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

        Myeloproliferative disorders undergoing transformation to terminal stages.

        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Richter transformation.

        High-grade lymphoma, refractory to standard treatment approaches, mantle cell lymphoma.

        No major organ dysfunction precluding transplantation.

        DLCO greater than 65% predicted.

        Left ventricular ejection fraction: greater than 40% predicted.

        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

        Informed consent given. Informed consent from parents for minors.
