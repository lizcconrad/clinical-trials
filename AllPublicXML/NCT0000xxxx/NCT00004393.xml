      OBJECTIVES: I. Conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study of the
      atypical neuroleptic risperidone (RIS) in the treatment of children and adults with moderate
      to severe Tourette Syndrome.

      II. Evaluate further the safety of RIS in this population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Initially,
      all patients receive placebo capsules twice daily in a single blind fashion during the first
      2 weeks of study.

      Then, patients are randomized to receive either risperidone (RIS) or placebo for 8 weeks. The
      dose of RIS is increased weekly over the first 4 weeks of treatment, as tolerated.

      Patients continue RIS for 4 additional weeks at the dose prescribed during week 4.

      All patients receive diagnostic evaluations at the beginning and end of the 2 week initial
      single blind phase, and at the end of weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the active treatment phase.
