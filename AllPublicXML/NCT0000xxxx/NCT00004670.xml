      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of pallidotomy immediately following 3 preoperative
      assessments vs. delayed pallidotomy following 6 months of standard medical therapy in
      patients with Parkinson disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. One group of patients undergoes the surgical
      procedure pallidotomy, a precise lesioning of brain cells in the globus pallidus.

      The other group receives standard medical care for 6 months followed by a pallidotomy.
