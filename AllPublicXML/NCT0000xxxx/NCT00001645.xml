  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, treat and follow patients with parasitic
      infections.

      People with a known or suspected parasitic infection who are at least 1 year old may be
      enrolled. This study does not involve any experimental treatments.

      Participants will have a physical examination and laboratory tests on blood, stool, or urine.
      Blood samples may be collected at regular intervals, but no more than 450 ml (15 ounces) of
      blood will be drawn from adults, and no more than 7 ml (1-1/2 teaspoons) per kg (2.2 pounds)
      of body weight from children, in any 6-week period. Other tests may include x-rays,
      electrocardiogram (EKG), or tissue biopsy (surgical removal of a small tissue sample),
      depending on the individual s condition.

      Patients may be offered treatment or may be referred to another study that is more
      appropriate for the problem. Any treatment provided in this study will be according to
      standard medical practice for the patient s specific medical problem. Patients responses to
      treatment will be evaluated at regularly scheduled clinic visits. The length of time between
      visits and the total duration of the study for a given individual will be determined by the
      study doctor, based on that person s medical condition.

      This study is designed as a prospective study to evaluate and treat patients with parasitic
      infection. Patients with known or suspected parasitic infection will be enrolled and will be
      evaluated for the presence of a parasitic infection. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit
      will include a medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests and
      specialized diagnostic procedures for possible parasitic infections. Treatment plans will be
      individualized for each patient's particular condition, and the number and length of
      additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment
      regimens will be in accordance with standard medical practice.
