    <textblock>
      This study will develop a behavioral and drug relapse prevention program for individuals who
      are dependent on both alcohol and tobacco. The study's goal is to show that individuals
      receiving nicotine replacement therapy and naltrexone (Revia) with behavior therapy will have
      higher rates of abstinence from both smoking and drinking than individuals who do not receive
      the drug therapies. Individuals will be placed in a 12-week outpatient treatment program with
      followup assessments 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.
