      BACKGROUND:

      The results from this study were expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of a practical
      program to protect women and their families from direct and indirect smoke exposure and to
      contribute longitudinal data on change processes involved in smoking cessation, especially
      those over the maintenance, relapse, and recycling stages, in a relatively complete
      population through a critical transition.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The TLC Program, unique in its focus on the postpartum period, used a researched model of
      behavior change that matched messages and skill training with the woman's stage of change. It
      also addressed the whole family to create a supportive environment for individual change,
      included other steps for families to protect children from passive smoke and negative
      modeling, and focused on smoking and smoke exposure directly as well as through self-care and
      child-care messages. The program used innovative materials, including videotapes and
      intervention.

      The study took place in two multi-ethnic health-care sites where the research team had
      conducted previous studies. The study used a randomized mixed design with 500 women who
      smoked regularly before pregnancy and who had been abstinent for &gt; 30 days at their 28th week
      of pregnancy. The primary outcome was abstinence at one year postpartum. Secondary outcomes
      were partner smoking status and exposure of the index baby. Self report was validated
      biochemically in samples of mothers and babies. The study design separated data collection
      from the experiments by enrolling subjects in a university-sponsored study of new mothers'
      health-care site.
