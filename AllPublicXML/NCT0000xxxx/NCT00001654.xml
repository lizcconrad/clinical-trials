  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dysregulated experience and expression of emotion is implicated in psychiatric disorders
      associated both with externalizing problems (aggressive, antisocial behaviors) and
      internalizing problems (anxiety, depression). Adolescence is a critical juncture in the
      development of these disorders because of the increased incidence and differentiation of
      clinical problems during this time period. This is a biobehavioral, longitudinal
      investigation of the role of emotion in the development of psychopathology in adolescence.
      The focus is on socialization experiences and biological processes that contribute to emotion
      dysregulation and disorder in male and female youths between 11 and 16 years of age. Groups
      studied include (1) comorbid externalizers and internalizers, (2) externalizers only, (3)
      internalizers only, and (4) asymptomatic youth. The adolescents are assessed again two years
      later, with instruments and paradigms similar to those used at Time 1. One theme pertains to
      the integration and disconnection of emotions across systems (e.g., physiological and
      self-report of experience), and how different patterns of emotion relate to psychopathology.
      A second theme pertains to development changes in how disorders are manifested (e.g.,
      increased differentiation along gender specific pathways). The anticipated number of patient
      days per year is 240 for adolescents and mothers, and 120 days for fathers.

      Dysregulated emotions are central features of psychiatric disorders associated with both
      externalizing problems (aggressive, antisocial behaviors) and internalizing problems
      (anxiety, depression). Adolescence is a critical juncture in the development of these
      disorders because of the increased incidence and differentiation of clinical problems
      particularly along gender-based lines. This is a biobehavioral, longitudinal investigation of
      the role of emotion in the development of psychopathology in adolescence. The focus is on
      socialization experiences and biological processes that contribute to emotion dysregulation
      and disorder. Younger (11-13) years) and older (14-16 years) male and female adolescents are
      followed over time to assess outcomes (psychiatric and psychological problems; adaptive
      functioning). Groups studied include (1) comorbid externalizers and internalizers, (2)
      externalizers, (3) internalizers, and (4) asymptomatic youth. Longitudinal analyses will
      examine factors that contribute to continuation, exacerbation, shifts, or improvement in
      symptoms over time. Time 1 data collection is complete and 30% of Time 2 cases have been
      seen. The current anticipated number of patient days per year is 150 for adolescents and
      mothers. Data collection will be completed by January, 2003.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects and their families will be recruited from the community.

        Inclusionary criteria will be based on mother and youth report of (a) emotion regulation
        problems and (b) the presence of subclinical or clinical symptomatology based on broad-band
        scales of the Youth Self-Report or mother's report of behavior problems.

        Individuals meeting entry criteria will be offered entry into the study, and others will be
        notified.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        A debilitating physical impairment (e.g., seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, head trauma).

        Significant intellectual impairment (i.e., IQ less than 70).

        History of psychosis.

        Any condition that would impair a participant's ability to respond to the study's paradigms
        will be excluded from this study at the time of screening.
