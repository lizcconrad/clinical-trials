      RATIONALE: Kidney-sparing surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for kidney cancer, and
      may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. It is unknown whether kidney-sparing
      surgery is more effective than kidney removal in treating kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to completely
      remove the kidney with kidney-sparing surgery in treating patients with resectable kidney
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare time to recurrence and survival of patients with single, low stage,
           nonmetastatic, well localized, and well delineated renal cell cancer treated with
           partial vs radical resection.

        -  Establish the side effects of kidney-sparing tumor resection in terms of morbidity and
           mortality in these patients.

        -  Study the relationship between tumor size, histologic grade, histologic type, and the
           extent of local control following partial resection.

        -  Determine which prognostic factors are important in selecting candidates for
           conservative surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients are randomized to undergo radical nephrectomy and limited lymphadenectomy (arm I) or
      conservative surgery (arm II).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1300 patients will be accrued for this study over 8 years.
