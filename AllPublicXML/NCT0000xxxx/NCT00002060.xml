  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the effect of Isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) in homosexual
      male patients with AIDS related complex (ARC) in delaying the onset of AIDS. Secondly, to
      determine the effect of Isoprinosine in decreasing the severity and/or incidence of lesser
      opportunistic infections and/or other conditions associated with ARC.
