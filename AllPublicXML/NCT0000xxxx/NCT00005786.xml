      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma or leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of arsenic trioxide in patients with relapsed
      or refractory low-grade lymphomas.

      II. To determine the incidence of complete and partial responses to arsenic trioxide in
      patients with previously treated low-grade lymphomas.

      III. To evaluate basic science correlates of arsenic trioxide activity in order to improve
      our understanding of the mechanism of action for arsenic trioxide in patients with low-grade
      lymphomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients with responding or stable disease may receive 6 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory low-grade lymphoma

          -  Patients must have disease that has relapsed from or is refractory to standard
             cytotoxic therapy; patients must have received at least one standard cytotoxic drug
             regimen; there is no limit on the number of prior therapies, including high dose
             chemotherapy regimens, provided the patient has recovered from prior toxicities;
             relapsed disease is defined as the development of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
             malignant lymphocytosis greater than 5,000, or infiltration of the bone marrow with
             malignant lymphocytes in a patient who had previously achieved a response of at least
             six months in duration; refractory disease is defined as never achieving a PR or a CR
             or PR that is less than six months in duration; prior total body irradiation is not
             allowed; radiation to individual site is permitted, and is not included as a regimen
