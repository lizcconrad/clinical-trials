      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the tolerance of patients with blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and
      sporotrichosis to different doses of itraconazole (R51,211).

      II. Determine levels of itraconazole in serum and other body fluids. III. Assess the course
      of illness during itraconazole therapy. IV. Determine the dosage of itraconazole that is safe
      and well tolerated by 80%-90% of patients and estimate the potential of this dosage for use
      in future comparative trials.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a study to estimate the optimal dose of oral itraconazole. Patients
      are treated at 1 of 3 doses of itraconazole; the starting dose for each patient is determined
      at entry.

      Therapy is administered daily for 3-6 months. Patients with progressive disease may be
      treated at the next higher dose; there may be only 1 such increase. Concurrent systemic and
      topical antifungals are prohibited.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
