      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether nitrocamptothecin is more effective
      than fluorouracil for pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin with
      that of fluorouracil in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory pancreatic cancer
      and who have been treated previously with gemcitabine.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival of patients with recurrent or refractory pancreatic cancer
      after treatment with nitrocamptothecin versus fluorouracil. II. Compare the clinical benefit
      and objective response rate to these treatment regimens in these patients. III. Compare and
      evaluate time to treatment failure in these patients with these treatment regimens. IV.
      Compare the toxicities of these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive nitrocamptothecin orally on days 1-5. Arm II:
      Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats weekly for 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with tumor
      regression or stabilization may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients with
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity may crossover to the alternate treatment arm.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for one year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 15 months.
