      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial of docetaxel in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer
      that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of weekly docetaxel as measured by disease response,
      strength and duration of pain reduction, and either a decrease in analgesic use without an
      increase in pain, or a decrease in PSA, in patients with hormone refractory metastatic
      prostate cancer. II. Assess the efficacy of this regimen in terms of survival in this patient
      population. III. Evaluate the effect of this regimen on quality of life in these patients.
      IV. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-30 minutes weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 8 weeks. Therapy continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of each course, and a daily
      pain medication diary is maintained during treatment. Patients are followed for 1 month or
      until resolution of toxicity, then every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
