      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to tumor cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim in
      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of serial intradermal or subcutaneous vaccinations of
      HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microspheres
      with adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with stage III or IV HER-2 expressing
      cancers. II. Determine whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the HER-2 protein
      can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by immunization with this regimen. III. Determine
      which route of immunization, intradermal or subcutaneous, is more effective in generating
      HER-2 specific CTL in these patients on this regimen. IV. Determine the extent to which
      escalated dose of PLG peptide affects the immune response in these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis prior to study and after final vaccination. Patients
      are sequentially entered into one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an
      intradermal vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into
      polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microspheres with adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF). Arm II:
      Patients receive a subcutaneous vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated
      into PLG microspheres with adjuvant GM-CSF. Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of
      subcutaneous vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into PLG microspheres
      with adjuvant GM-CSF. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients (5 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
