  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of HIV infection on substances produced by immune cells
      that increase or decrease HIV infection.

      HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers may be eligible for this study.
      Participants will be required to have a yearly medical evaluation, including blood tests for
      cell counts and chemistries, a blood or urine pregnancy test for women, and other laboratory
      tests as medically indicated or for research purposes.

      Participants will donate blood or reproductive fluids, or both. From 20 to 150 cc (4 to 30
      teaspoonfuls) of blood will be drawn from the arm using a small needle. Participants may be
      asked to provide blood samples on more than one occasion over the course of the study. No
      more than 450 cc (less than 1 pint) of blood will be drawn during any 6-week period. Males
      will be given a private room for semen donation; fluid from females will be collected with a
      cotton swab after speculum insertion. Participants may also be asked to have a buccal swab.
      For this procedure, the inside of the cheek is gently scraped with a blunt-ended stick or
      brush to obtain cells (buccal mucosal cells). The tissues will be used for a variety of
      studies on the effects of HIV infection on factors that increase or decrease HIV infection.

      Some of the tissues collected for this study may also be used for the following tests:

        -  Hepatitis screening Blood may be screened for different types of viral liver infections,
           such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, or G.

        -  Genetic testing DNA from blood or cheek cells may be examined for mutations or deletions
           that affect chemokines, cytokines and a family of enzymes called caspases. Chemokines
           and cytokines are important mediators of the immune response. Alterations in the genes
           for some of these substances influence HIV infection. Caspases regulate the process of
           cell death, known as apoptosis. Caspase gene variations may determine the rate of cell
           death in HIV-infected persons, and therefore, the rate of HIV progression. Patients with
           abnormalities of any of these genes may be invited to join other studies of the role of
           genetic defects in HIV infection.

        -  HLA testing Blood may be tested for HLA type a genetic marker of the immune system.
           These tests may be used to try to identify factors associated with the rate of
           progression of HIV disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is necessary to
           be able to perform certain research studies. Some HLA types have been associated with an
           increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other rheumatologic problems.

      We are studying the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Because of the lack of an adequate animal
      model it is generally necessary to utilize human peripheral blood cells for studying aspects
      of either in vivo or in vitro HIV infection. We wish to be able to continue to elucidate many
      pathogenic aspects of HIV infection using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a
      model.
