  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the belief that specific areas of the brain are
      connected differently in blind patients than patients with sight. In addition, the study will
      examine the different anatomical connections between brain areas of patients who became blind
      early in life versus patients who became blind later.

      The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that the anatomical connectivity of
      occipital and somatosensory areas in early blind subjects differs from that in subjects who
      became blind later in life and from that in sighted volunteers.
