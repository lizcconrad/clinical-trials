        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Patients may receive oral acyclovir and may continue prophylactic treatment for PCP,
             fungal infection, MAC and toxoplasmosis.

          -  Topical treatment and intralesional chemotherapy will be allowed for lesions which
             will not be used as indicator or biopsy lesions.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

        Localized radiotherapy will be allowed for lesions which will not be used as indicator or
        biopsy lesions.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documentation of a positive ELISA test for HIV with a confirmatory test.

          -  Biopsy proven, cutaneous or oropharyngeal Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory assessments that exhibit no evidence
             of an acute illness.

          -  Patients must agree to report all current medications to the primary investigator and
             obtain prior permission to use them when feasible.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Evidence of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Positive urine screen for recreational drugs.

          -  Current participation in another antiviral research study.

          -  Investigator anticipates poor patient compliance with the protocol.

          -  Patient has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may obscure the proper
             observation of the safety or activity of ritonavir.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Protease inhibitor therapy.

          -  Antiviral agent (e.g., oral ganciclovir or Foscarnet) or prophylactic medication for
             an AIDS defining illness which the patient cannot be removed from.

          -  Chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  Treatment with any medications that may interact with ritonavir.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

        Radiotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma.

        Patients with any of the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of psychiatric illness which is currently medically significant.

          -  History of pancreatitis.

             the study.

          -  Systemic chemotherapy of interferon within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Previous treatment with a protease inhibitor.

        Risk Behavior:
