    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term effectiveness of naltrexone treatment
      in alcohol-dependent patients who respond to short-term treatment. Those who respond to
      short-term treatment will be randomized to a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      maintenance phase with a 6-month posttreatment followup.

    <intervention_model_description>Naltrexone 50 mg was provided for 3 months to all study participants, who were masked regarding the identity of study medication. At 3 months, full and partial responders were randomized to an additional 9 months of double blind treatment with naltrexone or matched placebo. Full responders were defined as complete abstinence for the last six weeks of the acute phase. Partial responders were defined as having no more than 2 heavy drinking days in any given week and/or a 50% reduction in weekly alcohol consumption from baseline over the last six weeks of the acute phase.</intervention_model_description>
