      This protocol has three purposes: (1) to evaluate subjects for inclusion or exclusion from
      other NIAAA protocols; (2) to provide a common set of descriptive information that will be
      available on all NIAAA research subjects; (3) to allow NIAAA medical and nursing staff to
      treat alcoholic patients for acute alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal before
      requiring patients to consent to evaluation for participation in research studies.

      Information collected will include such items as psychiatric diagnoses, presence or absence
      of brain, liver or other organ damage, history of the amount of past alcohol consumption,
      other substance use and family history of alcoholism. This information will allow
      investigators to determine for which, if any, NIAAA research studies a subject is eligible.
      In order to avoid requiring intoxicated subjects to consent for procedures such as HIV
      testing, psychiatric interviews, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain we will
      obtain consent from all alcoholic subjects in two phases, using two separate consent forms.
      The first consent form will express the subject's desire to be admitted to the NIAAA
      inpatient unit for the purpose of treatment for alcoholism and will authorize only medical
      evaluation and treatment for alcoholism and associated problems. After an alcoholic subject
      has been admitted to the inpatient unit and is judged to be no longer intoxicated or
      suffering from acute alcohol withdrawal he or she will be presented with the second consent
      which will describe the evaluation for participation in other NIAAA research studies.
      Non-alcoholic, healthy controls will sign only one consent form describing the data to be
      collected and evaluation for participation in other NIAAA research studies.

      This protocol has three purposes:

        1. to evaluate non-treatment seeking participants for inclusion or exclusion from other
           NIAAA protocols. Non-treatment seeking participants includes individuals with no current
           or past alcohol use disorder, as well as individuals who meet the DSM IV criteria for
           alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (alcohol use disorders (AUD) but are not seeking
           treatment;

        2. to provide a common set of descriptive information that will be available on all NIAAA
           research participants;

        3. to collect blood samples from participants for the purpose of genetic analyses

      Information collected will include such items as psychiatric diagnoses, genotypes of several
      neurotransmitter-related and brain growth-related candidate genes, presence or absence of
      brain, liver or other organ damage, history of the amount of past alcohol consumption, other
      substance use and family history of alcoholism. This information will allow investigators to
      determine for which, if any, NIAAA research studies a subject is eligible. It will also allow
      investigators to examine the relationship among various candidate genes and brain structure
      and/or function in alcoholism.
