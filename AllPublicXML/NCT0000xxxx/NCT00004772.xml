      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the response of previously untreated patients with chronic inflammatory
      demyelinating polyneuropathy to intravenous immune globulin vs. placebo.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. The first group receives
      intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on days 1, 2, and 21; the second group receives an
      intravenous placebo on the same schedule.

      Patients in either group may receive IVIG (same dosage as first group) after day 42.

      Concurrent steroids and other immune globulin preparations are prohibited.
