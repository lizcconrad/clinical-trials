      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of eflornithine may be an effective way to
      prevent the recurrence of or further development of skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in
      preventing skin cancer in patients who have previously received treatment for early stage
      skin cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the rate of new skin cancer in patients with previously treated stage
      0, I, or II basal or squamous cell skin cancer treated with eflornithine (DFMO) vs placebo.
      II. Determine whether inhibition of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity serves as an
      intermediary marker for response to DFMO in these patients. III. Determine whether inhibition
      of skin polyamine levels serves as an intermediary marker for response to DFMO in these
      patients. IV. Assess the long term toxic effects of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      receive oral placebo daily for the first 4 weeks. Patients who comply with taking 80-100% of
      placebo are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      eflornithine (DFMO) daily. Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo daily. Treatment
      continues for 3-5 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop skin
      cancer during study undergo surgical excision and continue treatment on the arm to which they
      were originally randomized. Patients are followed every 6 months through year 5.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 334 patients (167 per arm) will be accrued for this study over
      2 years.
