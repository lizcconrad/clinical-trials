  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if valganciclovir is a safe treatment for CMV retinitis
      in patients who have been treated for this condition in the past. This study also examines
      the effectiveness of valganciclovir in preventing the recurrence of CMV retinitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive valganciclovir twice a day for 21 days as induction therapy then daily as
      maintenance therapy. Patients are encouraged to remain on study for at least 3 months and
      will remain until common study closure.
