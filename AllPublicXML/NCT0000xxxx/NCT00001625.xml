  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, and who are overweight are known to have defects
      in the way their body responds to insulin. The purpose of this study is to develop better
      methods for measuring the way body tissue responds to insulin and sugar (glucose).

      Researchers are planning to study four groups of patients.

        1. Normal volunteers

        2. Patients who have mild to moderate high blood pressure

        3. Patients who are overweight

        4. Patients who have mild to moderate diabetes controlled with oral medication

      In this study patients and volunteers will undergo two separate tests designed to determine
      how well insulin is working in the body. The first test is called a glucose clamp test.
      Patients will have two needles placed in the veins of their arms. One needle will be used to
      take blood samples, the other needle will be used to inject doses of sugar (glucose) and
      insulin.

      The second test is called the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test. In this
      test patients will have sugar (glucose) injected into their veins followed by a slow injected
      dose (infusion) of insulin. Researchers will periodically take blood samples during the test.

      Patients participating in the study will not directly benefit from it. However, the
      information gained from this study may be useful for improving the diagnosis and therapy of
      diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure (hypertension).

      We hypothesize that the majority of the information needed to accurately estimate insulin
      sensitivity is contained in the fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as the insulin and
      glucose levels obtained shortly after an intravenous glucose load. We propose to test this
      hypothesis by performing both hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps as well as
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests on normal volunteers and groups of patients with
      diabetes, hypertension, or obesity (diseases known to be associated with insulin resistance).
      Data from these studies will be used obtain estimates of insulin sensitivity by the glucose
      clamp method, minimal model method, and a novel analysis that utilizes only fasting and peak
      levels of glucose and insulin. We hope to devise a simpler method for determining insulin
      sensitivity in vivo that is suitable for testing large populations. This method will require
      only a few blood samples, take less than one hour to perform, and correlate with glucose
      clamp estimates at least as well as the minimal model method.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Normal Volunteers:

        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health with no significant underlying
        illnesses, on no medication, and a normal body mass index (20-26 kg/m(2)).

        Obese Subjects:

        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health with no significant underlying
        illnesses, on no medication, and a body mass index between 30 and 35 kg/m(2).

        Hypertensive Subjects:

        Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 in good general health except for mild to moderate
        hypertension (blood pressure between 140/95 and 170/109 off medication), on no medication
        except for antihypertensive agents.

        Subjects will be taken off all antihypertensive drugs for at least one week prior to study.
        If a subjects blood pressure exceeds 180/110 on three determinations over a period of at
        least 15 minutes, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and appropriate
        antihypertensive therapy resumed.

        Diabetic Subjects:

        Adults between the ages of 21 and 65 in good general health except for non-insulin
        dependent diabetes mellitus controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. Subjects on no other
        medications. If fasting blood glucose exceeds 300 mg/dl, the subject will be withdrawn from
        the study and appropriate therapy resumed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnancy, liver disease, pulmonary disease, end-organ damage such as renal insufficiency,
        coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, proliferative
        retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, or HIV infection.
