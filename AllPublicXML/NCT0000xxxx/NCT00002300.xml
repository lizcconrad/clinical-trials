      To compare the effects of megestrol acetate and placebo on body weight, anorexia, cachexia,
      calorie intake, and nutritional parameters of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AIDS. To
      characterize dose response in relation to weight gain. To determine whether megestrol acetate
      relative to placebo improves the perception of well-being among AIDS patients with cachexia.
      To evaluate megestrol acetate's effect on immune function via skin test reactivity, T4/T8
      ratio, and total lymphocytes.
