  <brief_title>ZD 1839 Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Comparative Trial of 2 Doses of ZD1839 (IRESSA) in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Versus Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients With Advanced (Stage III or IV) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Some tumors need growth factors produced by the body's white blood cells to keep
      growing. ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth factor and stop the tumor from growing. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with
      or without ZD 1839 for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      with or without ZD 1839 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the 1 year survival rate, time to worsening of disease related
      symptoms, and progression free survival in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with one of two doses of ZD 1839 or placebo combined with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. II. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these
      three regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to one of three treatment arms. All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Patients receive lower dose
      oral ZD 1839 (arm I), higher dose oral ZD 1839 (arm II), or placebo (arm III) twice on day 1,
      and then once daily thereafter. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6
      courses. ZD 1839 or placebo continues daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to study, then every 3 weeks until
      completion of chemotherapy, then every 4 weeks until completion of oral ZD 1839 or placebo,
      and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,029 patients will be accrued for this study.
