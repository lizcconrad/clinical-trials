      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      liposomal doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed or previously treated multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate and duration of response of multiple myeloma treated
      with doxorubicin HCl liposome, vincristine, and dexamethasone. II. Define the qualitative and
      quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into newly diagnosed (group A) and previously treated (group
      B) patients. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 2.5 hours, followed by
      vincristine by bolus IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Dexamethasone is administered orally or by
      IV on days 1-4. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses, and 2 courses
      after maximum response unless unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occur.
      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients from group A and 34 patients from group B will be
      accrued for this study within 6-14 months.
