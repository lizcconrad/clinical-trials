    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not responded to treatment with fludarabine. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die

      OBJECTIVES: Determine the complete and partial response rate to flavopiridol in patients with
      fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      Assess the toxicity profile of this treatment in these patients. Examine progression-free
      survival and overall survival following this treatment in these patients.

      Determine the effects of flavopiridol on normal T-cell subsets and immunoglobulin levels in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study.

      Patients registered before 9/15/2000 receive flavopiridol IV continuously on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for a total of 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients registered after 9/15/2000 receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for 5 years.
