      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 131-iodine-labeled
      monoclonal antibody fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2 administered intrathecally in patients with
      neoplasms metastatic to the leptomeninges. II. Identify objective therapeutic responses to
      this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy. Iodine-131-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody Fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2,
      131I-Me1-14 F(ab')2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to 6 patients will be treated at each dose studied.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed neoplasm that is recurrent in the
        subarachnoid space Biopsy of recurrent lesion required if original diagnosis made more than
        2 years prior to entry and CSF cytology negative Radiographic evidence of measurable lesion
        in the leptomeninges (by myelography, CT, or MRI) or cytologic evidence of malignancy in
        the CSF Any type of neoplasm eligible provided tumor cells (tissue or CSF preparation) bind
        significantly to intact monoclonal antibody Me1-14 IgG2a or to Me1-14 F(ab')2 Patency of
        subarachnoid pathways demonstrated by isotopic intraventricular flow

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 3 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 50-100%
        Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,000/mm3 Platelet count at least
        100,000/mm3 Hepatic: AST less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Alkaline
        phosphatase less than 1.5 times ULN Renal: Creatinine less than 1.2 mg/dL Other: No allergy
        to iodine Not pregnant or nursing
