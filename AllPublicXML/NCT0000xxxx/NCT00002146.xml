  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether acute ionized hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia immediately following
      foscarnet infusions can be lessened or eliminated by prior infusion of magnesium sulfate. To
      determine whether reductions in ionized magnesium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone
      levels following foscarnet infusions are lessened by preinfusion of magnesium sulfate. To
      evaluate the safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate prior to foscarnet infusion by
      monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm. To characterize the effect of
      magnesium sulfate on foscarnet blood levels and urinary excretion of calcium, magnesium,
      phosphate, and foscarnet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment groups. Intravenous foscarnet is
      administered for 4 days. Patients receive one of three doses of magnesium sulfate or placebo
      in normal saline according to one of four schedules. Sequence of doses will differ for each
      group.
