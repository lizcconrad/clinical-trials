  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a novel fiber optic device for treating
      scalp psoriasis with ultraviolet (UV-B) light. A effective treatment is not currently
      available for people with scalp psoriasis. Present methods for treating psoriasis with UV-B
      light cannot be used for the scalp because hair is usually blocking the light from reaching
      the affected skin. Our method overcomes this problem with the use of a comb that has optical
      fibers to deliver light directly to the skin. We will evaluate this device in a clinical
      setting and will use the results to tailor the design of the comb before producing it in
      large quantities.

      Scalp psoriasis can be treated with a novel fiber optic delivery system that irradiates the
      psoriatic scalp of patients with UV-B light via an optical fiber comb. Current methods for
      treatment of psoriasis with light are not applicable to the scalp because hair is usually
      blocking the light from reaching the affected skin. Our method overcomes this problem with
      the use of a comb that has optical fibers to deliver light directly to the skin. We have
      developed a UV-B light source and a fiber optic comb for use in clinics and doctors' offices.
      We will evaluate this device in a clinical setting.

      The results of this trial will provide data about the effectiveness of the device. We will
      use these results to tailor the design before it is ready for volume production. If
      successful, the UV-B light source and fiber optic comb will provide treatment to people
      affected with scalp psoriasis. At present, these people do not have any effective treatment
      available to them.
