      The purpose of this study is to determine if giving amphetamines along with standard
      rehabilitation speeds motor recovery after a stroke. In addition, if motor recovery is
      improved, the study will also identify the areas of the brain involved with the recovery.

      Researchers will use motor function ratings, PET scans, functional MRI (fMRI),
      electroencephalographs, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate patients.

      Patients participating in the study will be placed in one of two groups;

        1. Patients receiving dextroamphetamine and routine Rehabilitation Medicine

        2. Patients receiving a placebo &quot;sugar pill&quot; and routine Rehabilitation Medicine

      Patients that have improved motor recovery will undergo neuroimaging and neurophysiological
      studies to identify areas of the brain involved.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if administration of dextroamphetamine (amph)
      linked with customarily used Rehabilitation Medicine accelerates motor recovery after stroke.
      Additionally, if motor recovery occurs, this study will allow identification of the brain
      regions activated in association with this recovery.

      Techniques used will include longitudinal rating of motor function, neuro-imaging with
      positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI),
      electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients will be
      assigned to one of the two groups: amph linked with PT, and placebo linked with PT. Every
      patient will receive the standard of care PT. Motor recovery will be evaluated in the two
      groups. If motor recovery is accelerated in any of the groups, then neuroimaging and
      neurophysiological data will allow identification of areas and networks in the brain
      associated with this recovery.

      This is a Phase II study with potential major impact on how stroke patients are treated.
