  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and toxicity of combination therapy for AIDS-associated Kaposi's
      sarcoma with zidovudine (AZT) and two kinds of interferon alpha. The two kinds are interferon
      alpha (IFN-A) and interferon alpha-2A (recombinant) (IFN-A2A). To define the pharmacokinetics
      of AZT and IFN-A or AZT and IFN-A2A when given in combination. To define the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of each drug in combination and to define doses to be used in Phase II
      trial. AZT has been found to be effective against the effects of HIV in vitro (test tube) and
      both interferons have shown antiviral and antitumor effect on Kaposi's sarcoma. It is
      reasonable to assume that a synergism and an enhanced antitumor response may be seen with
      combination therapy. A study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZT in the
      combination with IFN-A2A is warranted.

      AZT has been found to be effective against the effects of HIV in vitro (test tube) and both
      interferons have shown antiviral and antitumor effect on Kaposi's sarcoma. It is reasonable
      to assume that a synergism and an enhanced antitumor response may be seen with combination
      therapy. A study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZT in the combination with
      IFN-A2A is warranted.

      Patients are randomized to receive IFN-A or IFN-A2A by intramuscular injection and combined
      with AZT orally daily for 8 weeks. Two cohorts of 4 patients enter each dose level. Patients
      do not enter into the next dose level until all patients have completed 3 weeks of treatment.
      AZT escalates only if there is no unacceptable toxicity (grade 2 in = or &gt; 3 patients or &gt;
      grade 2 in any patients); subsequent increase in IFN-A or IFN-A2A will be permitted, but the
      AZT dose will remain fixed. The MTD for a given IFN-A or IFN-A2A dose level is defined as
      grade 3 toxicity for hemoglobin or grade 2 toxicity for other parameters in 3 of the 6
      patients. Once the MTD is reached, there will be no further enrollment at higher dose level.
      Patients are followed every week for vital signs and hematologic studies. Patients tolerating
      the combination may be continued on therapy for 1 year at the same dose as the end of 8th
      week.
