      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      radiation therapy in treating adult patients with brain cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rate of patients with adult medulloblastoma,
           primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or disseminated ependymoma treated with preradiation
           combination chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the progression free survival and overall survival of these adult patients
           treated with combination chemotherapy followed by craniospinal radiation.

        -  Determine the toxic effects associated with this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours, etoposide IV, and vincristine IV over
      1-2 minutes on day 1; etoposide IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 2-3;
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 4-13; and vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on
      day 15. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 4-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy course, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a
      week for 6 to 7 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5-10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
