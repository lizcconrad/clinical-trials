      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin and
      carboplatin in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil) when
      combined with carboplatin in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Determine the rate of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil).
      Patients receive Doxil IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment continues every
      4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Doxil until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 of
      6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter until recurrence or
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.
