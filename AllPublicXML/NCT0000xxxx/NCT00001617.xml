  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the reliability of an instrument called the Quasi Elastic Laser
      Scattering Device (QLS) in detecting early changes in cataract formation.

      Surgery is currently the only treatment for cataracts. Many laboratories, however, are
      researching drugs to reverse, delay or prevent cataract formation. Anti-cataract drugs
      presumably would be most effective given early in the course of disease. When clinical trials
      of these drugs are begun, dependable and standardized methods for documenting and monitoring
      lens opacities will be needed to test their effectiveness. The QLS was designed to detect the
      earliest molecular changes in cataract development. This study will evaluate the usefulness
      and reliability of this instrument in measuring these changes.

      Normal volunteers and patients with cataracts in this study will have a standard eye
      examination, including a vision test and eye pressure measurement. The pupils will be dilated
      for QLS testing and for examination of the retina. Photographs of the retina may be taken.
      The QLS test uses a very dim laser light similar to that used to scan grocery items in the
      supermarket. The laser beam is projected into the lens of the eye, and the scattered light is
      collected and analyzed to determine normal and abnormal molecular interactions in the lens.
      Two measurements will be done for each eye. The test will be repeated in 6 months to
      determine reproducibility of the system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a device has been created to determine molecular interactions that occur in the
      nucleus of the lens, called Quasi Elastic Laser Scattering Device (QLS). Preliminary studies
      have shown its potential in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in cataract, at
      the stage where anticataract treatment would theoretically be most effective in reversing,
      delaying or preventing cataracts. A new miniaturized version of this device has been
      developed by NASA using low energy lasers and offered for further development and testing at
      the NEI. We therefore propose to conduct a preliminary study to evaluate the usefulness and
      reproducibility of this instrument for quantitating lens changes.

        Patients 18 years or older will be admitted to this study. There will be no gender or sex
        bias in the recruitment.

        Three subjects who are normal volunteers below age 40 and three subjects who are normal
        volunteers above age 40 will be recruited. These normal volunteers should have clear lenses
        with LOCS II clinical score for nuclear opalescence of 0.5 or less.

        In addition, 3 subjects who have early nuclear cataract (LOCS II/Nuclear opalescence -2)
        will also be recruited for the study.

        QLS data will be obtained on each eye of the normal and cataractous subjects in the nuclear
        region.

        No patients who have uveitis, glaucoma and who are thought to be at risk for an adverse
        reaction to pupil dilation, or have a history of allergic reaction to one of the dilating
        agents that will be used.
