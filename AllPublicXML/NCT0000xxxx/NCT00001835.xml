  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is an experimental anti-cancer drug that can shrink tumors such as colon cancer.
      However, because this drug can damage the kidneys, it is necessary to determine what doses of
      the drug can safely be given to patients with poor kidney function.

      Patients with advanced cancer, poorly functioning kidneys, and no good standard treatment
      options are eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with imaging tests, such as
      CT and MRI scans, to determine the size and location of the cancer and with blood and urine
      tests to evaluate kidney and liver function.

      Study participants will receive oxaliplatin intravenously (through a vein) every 3 weeks for
      as long as the cancer is under control and there are no serious side effects from the drug.
      If significant side effects develop, the dosage will be reduced, or the drug will be stopped.
      Blood tests to measure blood cell counts will be done at least once a week, and CT scans,
      chest X-rays, and MRIs will be done about once every 6 weeks to assess the tumor's response
      to the treatment. Additional blood tests will be done at the beginning of the first two
      treatment cycles to measure the amount of oxaliplatin in the blood, and urine will be
      collected during the first 24 hours of drug treatment to determine how much drug is
      eliminated by the body in urine.

      Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane platinum derivative with known anticancer activity in
      solid tumors. The recommended single-agent dose of Oxaliplatin in adult cancer patients with
      normal renal function is 130 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours every 3 weeks. Renal
      excretion is thought to be the major route of drug elimination, but precise dosing guidelines
      in patients with abnormal renal function have not been determined. This phase I and
      pharmacologic study of single agent Oxaliplatin is being conducted in adult cancer patients
      with impaired renal function. Patients will be stratified into four groups based upon their
      degree of renal impairment as assessed by a 24 hour creatinine clearance. Group A will
      consist of 12 patients with normal renal function who will serve as pharmacologic controls.
      The remaining 3 groups will start at different doses of Oxaliplatin based upon their degree
      of renal dysfunction and dose escalation in these groups will proceed in a manner in
      accordance with standard phase I trials with 3 patients per dose level until dose limiting
      toxicity is observed. Pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed in all patients on study.
      The goals of this trial are to define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of single agent
      Oxaliplatin in this patient population and to determine recommended doses of Oxaliplatin in
      patient with different degrees of renal dysfunction.

        Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy which is metastatic or unresectable
        and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
        effective.

        Patients with prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy are
        allowed with the exception that patients cannot have had prior treatment with oxaliplatin.

        Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        Patients must have an ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater
        than or equal to 60 percent) and a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function which includes:

        Leukocytes must be greater than or equal to 3,000/microliter.

        Absolute neutrophil count must be greater than or equal to 1,500/microliter.

        consent document.

        Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the
        study, or within 6 weeks of prior platinum therapy will be excluded.
