      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and feasibility of prostate specific antigen (PSA) RNA
      pulsed autologous dendritic cells in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. II. Evaluate
      the presence and magnitude of cellular immune responses against PSA as a surrogate target for
      immune activation in this patient population. III. Assess the presence, frequency, and
      activation status of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes prior to and following immunotherapy
      with this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate humoral immune responses as evidenced on
      circulating peripheral PSA specific antibodies in this patient population. V. Evaluate
      delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to irradiated PSA RNA transfected dendritic cells and
      other standard recall antigens prior to and following immunotherapy in these patients. VI.
      Evaluate eventual clinical responses as evidenced on clinical and biochemical (PSA) response
      criteria.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      RNA pulsed autologous dendritic cells IV over 2 minutes followed by PSA RNA dendritic cells
      intradermally on weeks 0, 2, and 4 for a total of 3 treatments. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of PSA RNA pulsed autologous dendritic cells until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months,
      then every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
