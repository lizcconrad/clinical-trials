  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of foscarnet induction treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      retinitis in AIDS patients who have previously suffered severe dose-limiting
      ganciclovir-related myelosuppression, who are ineligible for ganciclovir treatment due to
      myelosuppression or who have clearly failed to have a therapeutic response to ganciclovir
      therapy. To assess the duration of clinical response. To evaluate the effect on quantitative
      CMV cultures of blood and urine. To determine the effect on recovery of HIV p24 antigen
      capture direct from plasma.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Ganciclovir.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Known allergy to foscarnet.

          -  Any clinically significant pulmonary or neurologic impairment (e.g., patients who are
             intubated or comatose).

          -  Corneal, lens, or vitreous opacification which precludes examination of the fundi in
             patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Acyclovir.

          -  Nephrotoxic agent.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Known allergy to foscarnet.

          -  Any clinically significant pulmonary or neurologic impairment (e.g., patients who are
             intubated or comatose).

          -  Corneal, lens, or vitreous opacification which precludes examination of the fundi in
             patients with CMV retinitis.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 7 days of study entry:

          -  Immunomodulators.

          -  Biologic response modifiers.

          -  Investigational agents.

        AIDS patients experiencing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis may be enrolled if they meet one
        of the following criteria:

          -  Myelosuppression:

          -  Previously suffered severe dose-limiting ganciclovir-related myelosuppression, or are
             ineligible for ganciclovir treatment due to myelosuppression.

          -  Ganciclovir treatment failure:

          -  Clearly failed to have a therapeutic response to ganciclovir therapy.

          -  Patients must be able to give informed consent.

          -  Patients presenting with a baseline absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3 or
             baseline platelet count &lt; 50000 platelets/mm3 will be categorized as ineligible to
             receive ganciclovir induction therapy and will be allowed to enter the study.

          -  Patients who enter the study because of ganciclovir toxicity will have received
             ganciclovir therapy which resulted in either absolute neutrophil count falling to &lt;
             750 cells/mm3 or platelet count falling to &lt; 50000 platelets/mm3 on two separate
             occasions during either

             1) a ganciclovir induction regimen of 7.5 mg or less ganciclovir/kg/day in divided
             doses or 2) a maintenance regimen of 5 mg or less ganciclovir/kg/day as a single dose.

          -  Patients who enter the study because of ganciclovir treatment failure will meet one of
             the following criteria:

          -  1) CMV retinitis progression as defined in section V.C.1., i.e., has occurred either
             at the end of a 10 - 21 day induction course of ganciclovir (7.5 - 10.0 mg/kg/day in
             divided doses) or 2) during the first 28 days of maintenance ganciclovir therapy (5 or
             more mg/kg/day in at least 5 days/week) where maintenance therapy began within

               1. week of completing induction therapy.
