    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research protocol is to screen and enroll individuals who have bipolar
      disorder and to track each person's course of illness in order to study the long-term course
      of illness and to elucidate possible clinical and biological predictors of acute and
      sustained treatment response. As a part of this protocol, subjects will: systematically be
      administered psychiatric rating scales such as the life-chart method (LCM) for daily
      assessment of mood, sleep, and behavior; be asked to participate in non-invasive research
      procedures, such as blood drawing for measurement of thyroid antibodies and intracellular
      calcium; and be medicated as is clinically appropriate. This protocol also serves as a
      stepping stone to other protocols such as the comparative acute and long-term efficacy of
      three antidepressants (#95-M-0129), and the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (#00-M-0004), for
      which separate written informed consents are obtained. Patients in this study are
      participants in the larger NIMH-Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (SFBN), which involves six
      academic sites focused on better understanding the long-term course and treatment of the
      illness. The current protocol thus serves as an entry point for individuals with bipolar
      disorder for screening and detailed longitudinal assessment both prior to and in between more
      formal blind randomized IRB approved treatment protocols.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I disorder (BPI), Bipolar II disorder
        (BPII), Bipolar Disorder not otherwise specified (BPNOS), or schizoaffective disorder
        bipolar type.

        Subjects must be competent to comprehend the purpose of the study and to provide written
        informed consent and be willing to participate in detailed longitudinal follow-up.

        Subjects will undergo complete psychiatric diagnostic interview (SCID--DSM-IV), medical,
        neurological, and laboratory examinations (as appropriate such as EKG, renal and liver
        function tests, serum electrolytes, urinalysis, HIV, hepatitis B, pregnancy testing, and
        urine drug screen for the presence of psychoactive drugs and drugs of abuse).

        Subjects must be at least 18 years old.

        Subjects should have no general medical illness that is primary (i.e. appears to be causing
        the mood disorder), or contraindicates the use of conventional and study medications under
        other protocols.

        Women participants of child bearing potential must be nongravid, nonnursing, and using
        acceptable method of birth control such as intrauterine device, diaphragm with
        contraceptive foam, or condom with spermicide.

        Subjects must not have alcohol or substance use or dependence of sufficient magnitude to
        require independent, concurrent treatment intervention (excluding self-help groups), i.e.,
        hospitalization, day treatment programs, or counselor visits.
