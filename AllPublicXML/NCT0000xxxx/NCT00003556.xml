  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients with
      melanoma that cannot be treated with surgery. Vaccines may make the body build an immune
      response that may kill tumor cells. Combining more than one vaccine may kill more tumor
      cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects associated with ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with
      ALVAC-hIL-12 in patients with surgically incurable melanoma.

      II. Characterize the inflammatory and lymphokine response to this regimen in these patients.

      III. Examine the extent of nodule regression, humoral immune response, and cytolytic T cell
      activity with this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ALVAC-hB7.1

      Patients receive ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with ALVAC-hIL-12 intratumorally on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of ALVAC-hB7.1. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose of ALVAC-hB7.1 at which no more than 1 of 5 patients
      experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 43 days after the first vaccination.
