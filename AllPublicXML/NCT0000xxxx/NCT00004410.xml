      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether infants treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) have
      a lower peak direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, glutamyltranspeptidase levels and a reduced duration
      of cholestasis compared to the nontreatment arm.

      II. Determine the significance of lower birth weight and longer duration of total parenteral
      nutrition (TPN) on increasing risk of TPN associated cholestasis and increasing benefit from
      TUDCA therapy.

      III. Determine whether TUDCA therapy leads to significant reduction in the appearance of
      biliary tract sludge and/or stone formation in these infants.

      IV. Determine whether TUDCA therapy leads to reduced urinary excretion of potentially
      hepatotoxic bile acids as compared to the untreated arm matched for birth weight and duration
      of TPN.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by birth weight.

      Patients are randomized in pairs by birth weight to receive either a placebo in arm I or
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in arm II. TUDCA is administered by mouth, nasogastric
      tube, or gastrostomy tube twice daily. After 2 weeks of therapy, a bile sample is obtained
      via a duodenal tube. An ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract is performed
      after 2 weeks and every 3 weeks thereafter until discontinuation of therapy or until presence
      of biliary tract sludge is noted on 2 consecutive examinations.
