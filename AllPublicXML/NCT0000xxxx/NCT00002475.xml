      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Vaccines made from a patient's tumor tissue may make
      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy combined with vaccine
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cyclophosphamide with tumor
      cell vaccine in treating patients who have metastatic cancer or cancer at high risk of
      recurrence.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and clinical effects of autologous or allogeneic active-specific
           intralymphatic immunotherapy with a vaccine containing interferon alfa or interferon
           gamma-treated tumor cells followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with advanced
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified by tumor type.

      Tumor tissue is removed from the patient and incubated with interferon alfa or interferon
      gamma for 72-96 hours. (If autologous tumor cells are not available, an allogeneic vaccine is
      prepared.) Harvested activated cells are irradiated immediately prior to use.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV. 48-72 hours after cyclophosphamide administration,
      patients receive tumor cell vaccine intradermally. Patients also receive sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) subcutaneously prior to vaccine administration and once daily for the next 8 days.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with responding or stable disease after completion of course 3 may receive
      additional courses.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
