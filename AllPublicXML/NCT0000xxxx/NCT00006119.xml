      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hydroxyurea in treating patients who
      have recurrent and/or unresectable meningioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine complete, partial, or stable response to hydroxyurea in patients with
           recurrent and/or nonresectable meningioma.

        -  Determine response at 2 years to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine overall and disease free survival of these patients after this regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life of these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade of disease
      (I vs II or III).

      Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 2 years.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
