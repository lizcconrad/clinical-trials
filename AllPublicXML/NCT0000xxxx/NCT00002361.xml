  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give an anti-HIV drug
      combination containing indinavir and ritonavir to HIV-positive patients who have failed
      previous treatment with protease inhibitors.

    <textblock>
      Patients receive indinavir and ritonavir twice daily plus 2 NRTIs (NRTIs are not provided by
      this study). Physical examinations and laboratory tests, including plasma viral RNA levels
      and CD4 cell counts, are performed at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (or at
      discontinuation). The incidence of serious and drug-related adverse experiences is tabulated
      to determine drug safety. The proportion of patients achieving plasma viral RNA levels below
      50 copies/ml (by UltraSensitive assay) are estimated statistically to determine drug
      efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria

        You may be eligible for this study if you:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of 2500 copies/ml or greater within 45
             days of study entry.

          -  Have a CD4 cell count of 100 cells/mm3 or greater within 45 days of study entry.

          -  Have been on an anti-HIV drug regimen containing a protease inhibitor for at least 16
             weeks and initially did well on this treatment (your viral load decreased
             significantly) but later experienced treatment failure on this drug combination (your
             viral load increased significantly).

          -  Experienced treatment failure within 24 weeks of study entry.

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Agree to use effective barrier methods of birth control (such as condoms) during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        You will not be eligible for this study if you:

          -  Are allergic to ritonavir or indinavir.

          -  Have hepatitis.

          -  Have an abnormal chest x-ray or abnormal liver function tests.

          -  Have taken 2 protease inhibitors at the same time for 7 or more days.

          -  Have taken non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the 2 weeks
             before study entry.

          -  Have a medical condition that might make it unsafe for you to take the study drugs.

          -  Have experienced resistance to NRTIs and no new NRTI therapy is possible.

          -  Have taken certain medications.

          -  Abuse alcohol or drugs.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.
