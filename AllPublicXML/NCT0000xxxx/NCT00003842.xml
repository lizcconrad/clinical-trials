      RATIONALE: IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin may locate tumor cells and kill them without
      harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for recurrent malignant astrocytoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin in
      treating patients who have recurrent malignant astrocytoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumorally infused
      IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin in patients with recurrent malignant astrocytoma. II.
      Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine preliminarily any
      efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo a stereotactic biopsy
      under MR/CT guidance. Catheters are then placed into the tumor under stereotactic guidance.
      The catheter is filled with IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin (IL-4 toxin), with infusion
      beginning 24 hours after catheter insertion. The IL-4 toxin is infused over 4 days. The
      catheter is removed 45 minutes after the infusion is completed and a MR scan is performed.
      Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of IL-4 toxin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding the dose at which 2 of 3
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 16 weeks,
      then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
