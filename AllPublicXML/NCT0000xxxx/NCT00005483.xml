  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the distribution of homocysteine and prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia with
      emphasis on race, sex and age. To determine the extent to which hyperhomocysteinemia is
      associated with status of folate and vitamin B12. Finally, to describe the relationships
      between prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and
      assess the importance of this risk factor as a cause of vascular disease among US adults. The
      study was renewed for one year to investigate normal homocysteine concentrations among
      children and to identify nutritional and non-nutritional determinants of total homocysteine
      concentrations in children.

      BACKGROUND:

      Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations resulting
      from impaired sulfur amino acid metabolism, may be a powerful risk factor for occlusive
      vascular disease. However, little is known about the distribution of hyperhomocysteinemia in
      the general population. Furthermore, inadequate nutritional status might be a strong
      determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, but its importance at a population level (as measured by
      the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia associated with inadequate nutrition) has received
      little study. Finally, levels of homocysteine associated with elevated risk of vascular
      disease have not been clearly established.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using previously collected plasma samples, studies were conducted on the distribution of
      homocysteine and prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia with emphasis on race, sex and age.
      Investigations were undertaken on the extent of the relationship of hyperhomocysteinemia to
      folate and vitamin B12. Finally, the relationships were described between prevalence of
      hyperhomocysteinemia and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and the importance of this risk
      factor as a cause of vascular disease among US adults was assessed..
