      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cetuximab and irinotecan in treating
      patients who have advanced colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates and time to progression in
      patients with refractory advanced colorectal carcinoma treated with cetuximab and irinotecan.
      II. Determine the safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess
      the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the tumor epidermal
      growth factor receptor levels in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by response to irinotecan based
      chemotherapy regimen (stable disease vs disease progression). Patients receive a test dose of
      cetuximab IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients who do not experience grade 4 anaphylactic
      reaction receive a loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2 hours beginning 30 minutes after
      completion of test dose. Patients receive maintenance cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15,
      22, 29, and 36. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes (beginning 1 hour after
      completion of cetuximab infusion) at the same regimen (dosage and frequency) on which the
      patient became refractory to irinotecan therapy. Irinotecan is administered at a higher dose
      on days 1 and 22 OR at a lower dose on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with unacceptable
      toxicity to irinotecan may continue on cetuximab maintenance therapy alone at the discretion
      of the protocol investigator and sponsor. Quality of life is assessed before initiation of
      study therapy, at the completion of each course, and then at 4 weeks after completion of
      study. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 110 patients (55 per strata) will be accrued for this study
      within 7 months.
