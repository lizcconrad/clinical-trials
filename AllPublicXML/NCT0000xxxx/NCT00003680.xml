      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation is
      more effective than standard chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy
      with that of high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating
      women who have advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival in locally advanced, inflammatory, or operable
      large primary breast cancer (greater than 3 cm) patients with positive axillary lymph nodes
      at surgery following primary chemotherapy, receiving either conventional chemotherapy or high
      dose chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. II. Compare the relapse-free survival and quality of
      life in these patients receiving this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter, open label study. Patients are stratified by
      study center and number of positive axillary lymph nodes at surgery. Patients are randomized
      to receive conventional or high dose adjuvant chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive
      conventional chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil IV
      administered once every 3 weeks for 8 courses. Arm II: Patients receive high dose
      chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on day 1. Patients undergo peripheral blood
      progenitor cell (PBPC) collection, then receive cyclophosphamide and thiotepa IV for 4 days,
      13-28 days after PBPC collection. Peripheral blood progenitor cells are then reinfused.
      Patients undergo radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy and receive oral tamoxifen for 5
      years, beginning at the same time as radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor negative patients may
      receive tamoxifen at the discretion of the treating physician. Quality of life is assessed
      before chemotherapy, then at 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients are followed at 12, 18, and 24
      months, then annually for 5 years or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 300 patients.
