      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and
      O6-benzylguanine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive
      anaplastic glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) effective in producing complete
           suppression of tumor O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity in patients with
           newly diagnosed (closed to accrual 12/19/2000) or recurrent or progressive cerebral
           anaplastic glioma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide administered after O6-BG in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

        -  Part I: Patients receive escalating doses of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) IV continuously
           for 49 hours until the dose that produces the target depletion of tumor
           O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is determined. Patients undergo a craniotomy
           after completion of the O6-BG infusion. (closed to accrual 12/19/2000)

        -  Part II: After determination of the O6-BG dose in Part I, patients with recurrent
           malignant gliomas receive O6-BG IV continuously for 49 hours beginning on day 1.
           Patients also receive oral temozolomide on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients (with 14 patients participating in Part II)
      will be accrued for this study.
