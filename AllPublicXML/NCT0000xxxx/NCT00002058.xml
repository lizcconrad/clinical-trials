  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of clofazimine in the prophylaxis of Mycobacterium
      avium complex infection in HIV infected individuals who are at risk to develop this
      untreatable opportunistic disease. In the absence of truly effective antiretroviral therapy,
      a potential mode of treatment of patients with HIV infection is to prevent the development of
      the life-threatening opportunistic infections. Current studies demonstrate a possible
      efficacy of clofazimine in the prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), the
      most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. Future studies will examine the potential
      for prophylaxis against the other opportunistic infections. This proposal hopes to define the
      role of prophylactic clofazimine in preventing the currently untreatable Mycobacterium avium
      complex infection. AMENDED: To include prophylaxis for Asymptomatic and ARC.
