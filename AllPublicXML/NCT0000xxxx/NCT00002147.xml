      To provide Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ( DOX-SL ) as a therapy for Kaposi's
      sarcoma patients who have no remaining treatment options other than DOX-SL or patients who
      have been participating in another DOX-SL protocol and for whom continuation in DOX-SL is
      medically indicated. Also, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOX-SL in patients with
      Kaposi's sarcoma who have previously received systemic chemotherapy with or without an
      anthracycline.
