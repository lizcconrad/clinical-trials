  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The normal changes of puberty, such as breast enlargement, pubic hair and menstrual periods,
      usually begin between the ages of 9 and 15 in response to hormones produced in the body. Some
      children's bodies produce these hormones before the normal age and start puberty too early.
      This condition is known as precocious puberty.

      The hormones responsible for the onset of puberty come from the pituitary gland and the
      ovaries. The hormones from the pituitary gland act on the ovaries to produce different
      hormones that cause the breasts to grow, pubic hair to develop, and menstruation.

      Many children with precocious puberty can be treated with a medication known as lutenizing
      hormone-releasing hormone analog (Lupron, Histerelin, Deslorelin). This drug is made in a
      laboratory and is designed to act like the natural hormone LHRH, which is made in the
      pituitary gland. The drug causes the pituitary gland to decrease the amount of hormones it is
      releasing and thereby decrease the amount of hormones released by the ovaries. However, some
      girls already have low levels of pituitary hormones and yet their ovaries still produce
      hormones. Researchers do not believe that LHRH analog therapy will work for these children.

      Testolactone is a drug that acts directly on the ovary. It works by preventing the last step
      of estrogen production in the ovary. The goal of this treatment is to stop estrogen
      production and delay the onset of puberty until the normal age.

      Researchers will give patients with LHRHa resistant precocious puberty Testolactone for six
      months. If the initial treatment is successful and patients do not experience very bad side
      effects, they will continue to receive the medication until puberty is desired. Throughout
      the therapy patients will receive frequent monitoring of their general state of health,
      hormone levels, and medication levels.

    <textblock>
      Females with precocious puberty who have low levels of serum gonadotropins and high levels of
      serum estrogen, or those who have demonstrated an inadequate clinical response to therapy
      with the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog (Lupron, Histerelin, Deslorelin), will
      be treated with testolactone. Testolactone inhibits aromatase, the last enzyme of estrogen
      biosynthesis. The goal of treatment is to inhibit estrogen secretion and thus delay secondary
      sexual maturation and epiphyseal closure until the normal age. The intent is to alleviate the
      psychological problems and short stature frequently associated with this disorder. Throughout
      therapy, patients will receive frequent clinical, hormonal, and toxicological monitoring. The
      initial treatment period will be six months. If patients respond to the treatment and
      tolerate it well, testolactone will be given until puberty is desired. Patients who exhibit
      pubertal levels of serum gonadotropins during testolactone therapy, indicating the onset of
      secondary, gonadotropin-dependent puberty, will receive an LHRH analog in addition to
      testolactone.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are girls aged 1-8 years (on entry to the study) with gonadotropin-independent
        precocious puberty. All ethnic groups are included.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males are excluded, as are patients with clinically-significant hepatic and/or renal
        impairment (testolactone is metabolized via the liver and kidneys).
