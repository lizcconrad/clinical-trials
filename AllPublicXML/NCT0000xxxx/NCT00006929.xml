      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining suramin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin
      in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the minimum effective dose of suramin that will reduce resistance to
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
      lung cancer (phase I). (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).

      II. Evaluate pharmacokinetic interactions of this drug combination in these patients (phase
      I). (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).

      III. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen (phase II
      [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]).

      IV. Determine the time to tumor progression, progression-free rate at 6 months, and 1-year
      survival of patients treated with this regimen (phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed
      to accrual 9/1/03]).

      OUTLINE: Patients in phase II are stratified according to prior treatment (chemotherapy naive
      [closed to accrual 9/1/03] vs chemotherapy refractory). Phase I (phase I closed to accrual
      1/29/02):

      Patients receive suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive paclitaxel
      IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of suramin until the target dose is
      determined. The target dose is defined as the dose at which at least 5 of 6 patients achieve
      optimal plasma concentrations of suramin and no more than 1 of 6 patients exceed optimal
      level. Doses of paclitaxel are adjusted until the maximum tolerated dose in combination with
      suramin and paclitaxel is determined.

      Phase II (chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03): Patients receive the target
      dose of suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over
      3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3-6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 82 patients (18 for phase I [phase I closed to accrual
      1/29/02] and 64 for phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]) will be
      accrued for this study.
