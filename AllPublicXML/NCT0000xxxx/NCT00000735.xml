  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of intravenous infusion of ampligen in symptomatic HIV-infected
      patients at several dose levels, to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated, and to
      measure the effects of ampligen on the HIV virus infection, immune function, and clinical
      condition. Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been
      shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that
      can be achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.

      Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to
      stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that can be
      achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.

      Patients entered in the study are given ampligen by intravenous infusion at hemophilia
      treatment centers once during the first week of the trial and twice a week during the
      following 12 weeks. The dose each patient receives is determined by the responses of earlier
      patients. If the status of the HIV infection does not improve after the first 13 weeks,
      ampligen will be stopped. Each patient maintains a daily diary listing any symptoms or
      problems that occur such as headache, nausea, or change in appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs
      cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen should not be taken for more
      than 72 hours at any time during the trial without consulting the research staff. Blood will
      be drawn at intervals during the 13-week trial and 8-week follow-up and used to determine the
      effect of ampligen on HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor toxicity and side
      effects.
