  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to screen patients with heart diseases who may qualify to participate
      in other research studies being conducted by the Cardiology Branch of the National Heart,
      Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

      Patients participating in this research study will be seen on an outpatient basis and undergo
      a general medical evaluation, including blood tests, urine, examination, chest x-ray and
      electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition, patients may be asked to have an echocardiogram
      (ultrasound scan of the heart) and to perform an exercise stress test.

      Patients participating in this study will not receive any investigational treatments.
