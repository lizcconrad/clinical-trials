  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and toxicities of intravenously administering a
      genetically modified type of Salmonella bacteria (VNP20009) and its impact on tumor growth in
      advanced or metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread from the primary site). The first
      patients in the study will be given the smallest dose of VNP20009, and those who enter later
      will receive increasingly larger doses. This will be done to determine the maximum dose that
      can be given without serious side effects.

      Normally, Salmonella bacteria ingested in food or water can cause diarrhea or more severe
      illness. The bacteria in this study are altered genetically so they can be injected through a
      vein and circulate in the blood with less likelihood of causing side effects. It is believed
      that the bacteria will travel in the blood to the tumor and infect it. In studies of mice,
      tumor growth slowed in animals whose tumors were infected with VNP0009.

      Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer 18 years of age or older whose disease is not
      responding to standard treatment, or for which there is no treatment, may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates will undergo a medical history and physical examination, including
      blood tests, scans, X-rays, electrocardiogram, and urine, stool and blood cultures.

      Study participants will be admitted to the hospital for 2 to 4 days. On day 1, they will
      receive the first dose of VNP0009, infused over a 30-minute period through an intravenous
      catheter (a small plastic tube inserted into a vein). Blood will be drawn every day to
      determine if the bacteria are still in the body. After discharge, patients will return to the
      hospital on days after approximately 1-2 weeks and again after 4-5 weeks for additional blood
      tests to measure levels of the bacteria and for collection of blood, urine and stool samples.
      Patients whose tumors are on or just beneath the skin may be asked to have one or two tumors
      removed surgically.

      Patients will have tests after approximately 4-5 weeks, including CTs and X-rays, to
      determine the size and extent of the tumor. Patients whose tumor remained the same size or
      smaller than before starting treatment, and whose side effects were acceptable will be
      offered a second treatment cycle. Those whose tumor grew during treatment will be taken off
      the study. Patients remaining in the study will begin the second cycle on approximately day
      36. Tumor growth will be evaluated again between days 64 and 70, and a third cycle will be
      offered to patients whose tumors have remained stable or have shrunk. Patients may have up to
      12 treatment cycles as long as evaluations continue to show the tumor is stable or shrinking.
      Completing all 12 cycles takes about 13 months. Patients will continue to be evaluated after
      treatment ends, if they agree to continued follow-up.

      Patients must follow health precautions to prevent infecting others with Salmonella bacteria
      as long as they, themselves, remain infected. These include, for example, stringent hand
      washing practices and avoiding contact with people with weakened immune systems. All the
      precautions will be explained to the study participants.

      Patients who leave the study must take antibiotic therapy to rid the body of any remaining
      bacteria. They will return for urine, stool and blood cultures 30 days after the start of
      antibiotics, and may undergo three types of scans to look for sites of infection. Treatment
      will be given as needed.

      Patients with metastatic cancer will receive the intravenous injection of live genetically
      modified Salmonella typhimurium. This bacteria has been genetically modified to alter its
      pathogenicity and to attempt to increase its localization to sites of growing cancer. Cohorts
      of patients will receive increasing doses of the bacteria to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Only patients must have advanced and/or metastatic, histologically documented solid tumors
        will be included.

        Patients must have a solid tumor which is no longer considered responsive to available
        conventional modalities or treatments (failed any known standard curative or palliative
        therapy for that disease), or a previously untreated tumor for which no effective standard
        treatment is available. Patients must have measurable or evaluable metastatic disease.

        All patients must have at least one tumor mass suitable and easily accessible for
        excisional biopsy or fine needle aspiration. The procedure must be able to be performed
        with minimum morbidity and discomfort to the patient.

        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

        Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

        Patients must have expected survival of at least 3 months.

        Men and women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not
        surgically sterile), must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine
        device (IUD), oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and women must have a negative
        serum or urine pregnancy test 1 week before beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing
        patients are also excluded.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with any one of the following criteria will not be eligible for study
        participation:

        Diagnosis of lymphoma or other hematologic malignancy.

        An artificial implant that cannot be removed (e.g., heart valves, prosthetic hips or knees,
        or other devices) which could represent a nidus of infection.

        Known history of valvular disease or severe arteriosclerosis. Patients with a significant
        murmur on physical examination will undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for valvular
        disease.

        Known clinically significant atherosclerotic disease, peripheral vascular disease, or
        arterial aneurysm(s) or arterial or venous malformations. Patients in atrial fibrillation
        will undergo an echocardiogram to rule out presence of thrombus, which would make them
        ineligible.

        An ultrasound will be performed pre-treatment in patients with intact gallbladders. No
        patients with any evidence of cholelithiasis or obstruction, unless they are able to
        undergo a simple cholecystectomy with minimal morbidity, in which case they would be
        eligible once they have fully recovered to their baseline status.

        All patients will be screened with an ultrasound of the kidneys. Patients with urolithiasis
        will be excluded.

        Active infection of any kind, including Hepatitis B or chronic viral hepatitis.

        Documented Salmonella infections within 6 months.

        Currently using antibiotics.

        Patients with tumor fever, or fever of unknown origin or cause.

        Any known bleeding disorder.

        Patients must not have had a splenectomy or documented immunodeficiency such as HIV
        infection. These patients are excluded because VNP2009 may be more toxic in severely
        immunocompromised patients.

        Patients on steroids, immunosuppressives, or any other medications that can directly or
        indirectly suppress the immune system.

        Presence of any other life-threatening illness, such as unstable angina, severe oxygen
        dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end stage liver or renal disease.

        Requirement immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery.

        Presence of a known brain metastases. Patients with previously treated brain metastases and
        no evidence of recurrence are eligible.

        Unwilling and unable to follow protocol requirements.

        Hypersensitivity (history of allergic reactions) to quinolone or cephalosporin antibodies.
