      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than once drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus estramustine in
      treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate (PSA and/or objective response) and duration of
      response to weekly paclitaxel plus estramustine in patients with metastatic hormone
      refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the effect on quality of life of this regimen in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Patients receive oral
      estramustine the day before, the day of, and the day after paclitaxel administration each
      week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression. A quality of life questionnaire is completed before treatment and 2 months after
      treatment initiation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
