      This study will evaluate the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug etanercept (Enbrel) on
      relieving pain and swelling after oral surgery. The Food and Drug Administration has approved
      Enbrel for treating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including pain.

      Healthy volunteers 16 to 35 years of age who require third molar (wisdom teeth) extractions
      may be eligible for this study. Participants must not be allergic to aspirin or to
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Candidates will be screened for eligibility
      with a medical history and oral examination, including X-rays if needed.

      Participation in the study requires four clinic visits: two for surgery and two for
      follow-up:

      Visit 1:

      Patients will have ultrasound pictures taken to measure cheek size. One hour before surgery,
      they will receive a dose of either 25 milligrams (mg) of Enbrel; 15 mg of the standard pain
      medicine Toradol; or a placebo (salt-water) through an arm vein. A local injection of an
      anesthetic (lidocaine) will be given before surgery to numb the mouth, and a sedative
      (Versed) will be infused through a vein to induce sleepiness. When the anesthetic takes
      effect, a small piece of tissue will be removed from the inside of the cheek, and then the
      upper and lower molars on one side of the mouth will be extracted. After surgery, a small
      piece of tubing will be placed in the lower extraction site, from which samples will be
      collected to measure chemicals involved in pain and inflammation. Patients will stay in the
      clinic for 4 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off and will complete pain
      questionnaires during that time. If, an hour after surgery, patients have pain that is not
      relieved by the treatment given before surgery, they may receive acetaminophen (Tylenol) and
      codeine for pain. Another biopsy will be taken (under local anesthetic) from the inside of
      the cheek when pain occurs or at the end of the 4-hour observation period. The tubing then
      will be removed and the patient discharged with Tylenol and codeine for pain.

      Visit 2:

      Patients will return to the clinic in the morning 48 hours after the oral surgery for a 1- to
      2-hour visit. They will fill out questionnaires, undergo ultrasound imaging of both cheeks
      and have another biopsy taken from the inside of the cheek on the operated side.

      Visits 3 and 4:

      Three weeks after the first surgery patients will schedule extraction of the two wisdom teeth
      on the other side of the mouth, and the procedures for visits 1 and 2 will be repeated.

      The proposed investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled
      within-subjects design clinical study to evaluate the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) in acute inflammation using a specific TNF receptor antagonist, etanercept
      (Enbrel, Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA). The goal of this study is to determine whether
      inhibition of TNF bioactivity can attenuate acute inflammation. The anti-inflammatory and
      adverse effects of etanercept, a recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein, will be evaluated
      using a model of tissue injury, the oral surgery model. Briefly, healthy volunteers referred
      for third molar extraction will undergo the surgical extraction of third molars with local
      anesthesia and conscious sedation. At the completion of the surgical procedure, a
      microdialysis probe will be placed under the mucogingival flap previously elevated for the
      surgical procedure and subjects will be observed for pain and swelling over the course of
      four hours following surgery. Tissue biopsies prior to and following surgery will be obtained
      from the buccal mucosa. Etanercept or control will be administered parenterally one hour
      prior to surgery. Tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and
      inflammatory mediators will be measured at time intervals postoperatively. Pain and swelling
      will be assessed postoperatively over the course of four hours and at 48 hours. Demonstration
      of amelioration of pain, swelling, and/or changes in levels of tissue mediators will be taken
      as evidence of an acute anti-inflammatory effect of etanercept. Since the fusion protein
      (hereafter, TNFR:fc) specifically binds TNF-alpha and prevents its interaction with cellular
      receptors, changes in the inflammatory cascade and clinical endpoints of inflammation may
      provide insight into role of TNF-alpha in the pathophysiology of acute inflammation and its
      clinical sequela.
