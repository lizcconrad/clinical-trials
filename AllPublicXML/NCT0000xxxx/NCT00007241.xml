    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that isometric strengthening helps people with osteoarthritis of the knee.
      Isometric strengthening is muscle-strengthening exercise without movement, in which a person
      applies a force against a resistant object--for example, pushing against a brick wall. This
      study will test the effectiveness of a portable isometric exercise device for home use that
      guides a person through an exercise program using various forms of feedback. We will look at
      whether people exercising with the device achieve better outcomes (results) in pain,
      stiffness, strength, and functional measures compared to people who do not use the device or
      people exercising according to printed material from arthritis organizations.

      Previous studies have shown that isometric strengthening is beneficial in managing
      osteoarthritis of the knee. This type of exercise can decrease joint-related pain and
      stiffness while increasing strength and functional measures. However, individuals rarely
      adhere to isometric exercise for any lengthy period of time because there has not been a way
      to measure applied force and performance over time in the home setting. In addition, this
      type of exercise has often been described as &quot;boring.&quot; We believe that being able to monitor
      one's progress is essential in maintaining adherence to an isometric exercise program. This
      study will examine the effectiveness of a portable isometric exercise device for home use
      that guides the user through an exercise protocol by means of various forms of feedback.

      We hypothesize that individuals exercising with the device will achieve better outcomes in
      pain, stiffness, strength, and functional measures than a control group or a group exercising
      according to printed material from arthritis advocacy groups. We will randomly assign study
      participants meeting eligibility criteria to the exercise device group, exercise according to
      printed material group, or control group. We will conduct measures in all groups during a
      clinic visit at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. As subjects in the exercise device group
      strengthen their leg muscles, a physical therapist will likely need to adjust upward the
      target force for different leg positions during every clinic visit, 2 weeks apart.

          -  Able to give conformed consent.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Pain symptoms provoked by activity in the more symptomatic knee of between (and
             inclusive of) 3/10 and 8/10 on a verbal analog scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a strengthening program of the knees in the past month.

             months.

          -  Poor health that would impair compliance or assessment.

          -  Arthroscopy of either knee in the past six months.

          -  Lateral instability of &gt; 15 degrees, or posterio-anterior instability of greater than
             1 cm.

          -  History of cancer (other than skin cancer) not in remission.

          -  Symptomatic spine, hip, ankle, or foot disease other than osteoarthritis that would
             interfere with assessment of the knee.
