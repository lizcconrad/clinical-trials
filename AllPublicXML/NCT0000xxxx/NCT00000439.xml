      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of sodium valproate (Depacon) in
      treating individuals with alcohol dependence and comorbid bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the mood stabilizer, anticonvulsant, sodium valproate in
      individuals with alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, and randomized trial of 6 months duration. All subjects are treated with
      treatment as usual, which include lithium carbonate and individual dual recovery counseling
      and are randomized to either sodium valproate or placebo.
