  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of amphotericin B plus flucytosine
      (5-fluorocytosine) compared to amphotericin B alone for a first episode of acute cryptococcal
      meningitis in AIDS patients, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of fluconazole
      versus itraconazole.

      At least 10 percent of patients with a low CD4 count and HIV infection will develop
      meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans. More effective treatments than the standard
      therapy need to be explored.

      At least 10 percent of patients with a low CD4 count and HIV infection will develop
      meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans. More effective treatments than the standard
      therapy need to be explored.

      Patients are selected by a randomization process to take amphotericin B intravenously (in the
      vein), for 14 days, and either placebo (ineffective substance) or flucytosine for 14 days.
      Then patients are again selected by a randomization process to take either (1) fluconazole
      for a total of 8 weeks plus itraconazole placebo; or (2) itraconazole for a total of 8 weeks
      plus fluconazole placebo.

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine or systemic chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii
