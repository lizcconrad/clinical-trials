      This study will examine the long-term effects of lithium used to treat children and
      adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder (severe aggression).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychotherapeutic agents are often administered without sufficient testing to children and
      adolescents, often on a long-term basis, to reduce aggression. Many pressures, including
      managed care, will increase the utilization of pharmacotherapy in the outpatient setting to
      treat serious problems. Lithium is the most promising agent for the treatment of aggression
      in children and adolescents. However, it has not been shown that lithium is an effective
      treatment for these patients in the outpatient (non-hospital) setting, or on a long-term
      basis. The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term effects of lithium used to treat
      children and adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder (severe aggression).

      The proposed study is a two-phased clinical trial of lithium for the treatment of aggression
      in conduct disorder. Both phases are double-blind and placebo-controlled with randomization
      and employ a parallel groups design. Phase 1 contains a short-term 8-week controlled trial,
      with twice as many subjects randomized to lithium as placebo, increasing the pool of
      potential lithium responders to continue to Phase 2. In Phase 2, lithium responders from
      Phase 1 enter a 6-month long-term controlled trial. Every attempt is made to define
      responders to lithium.
