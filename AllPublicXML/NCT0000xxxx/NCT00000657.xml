  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of orally administered didanosine (ddI) with high
      dose orally administered zidovudine (AZT) in patients who develop or exhibit progression of
      the AIDS dementia complex (ADC) and who have not previously been intolerant to AZT at doses
      of up to 1000 mg/day.

      HIV-infected or AIDS patients may develop ADC which causes damage to the nervous system. ADC
      may be caused by some action of the AIDS virus on the nervous system, although similar
      problems can be caused by other infections because the AIDS virus lowers the body's ability
      to fight other infections. It is important to determine whether symptoms are due to ADC or to
      some other infection since treatment varies for different conditions. AZT has been shown to
      be beneficial to people with ADC although its effectiveness has only been studied in a small
      number of patients. Studies suggest that higher doses of AZT are more likely to be effective
      than standard doses in improving symptoms of ADC.

             trial.

          -  In patients for whom it is medically necessary to initiate or alter therapy with these
             drugs during the initial 16 week study period, data will not be used in the study.

          -  Metronidazole for single courses of therapy not to exceed 14 days within consecutive
