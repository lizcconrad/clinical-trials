      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of raltitrexed in treating patients who
      have malignant mesothelioma that cannot be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the therapeutic activity and toxicities of raltitrexed in patients
      with inoperable malignant mesothelioma. II. Determine the objective response rate and
      duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Within 2 weeks of staging procedures, patients receive
      raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks thereafter for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
