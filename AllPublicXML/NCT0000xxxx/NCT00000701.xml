  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the drug zidovudine (AZT) in children, including study of drug
      levels in various parts of the body fluids, safety of the drug, and its effect on different
      parts of the body.

      The effects of any drug, the way a drug enters the bloodstream, the way it is used by the
      body, and the way the body eliminates the drug may be very different in children compared
      with adults. The largest group of children who have AIDS are those who are less than 2 years
      of age. AIDS is often first identified in infants who are about 6 months old. Studies of AZT
      show that it might be useful in the treatment of AIDS. Thus it is important to study the
      effects of the drug in children.

      Patients are hospitalized for 8 weeks to receive AZT through the intravenous (IV) route at 1
      of 2 doses. Patients are then discharged from hospital and take AZT by mouth for 4 more
      weeks.
