      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by autologous
      bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the ability of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to purge bone
      marrow cells of clonogenic chronic myelogenous leukemia tumor cells and repopulate the bone
      marrow with normal stem cells in patients treated with high-dose busulfan and
      cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation using marrow treated with
      c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. II. Determine the response rate, degree of
      hematopoietic reconstitution, overall survival, and relapse-free survival of patients treated
      with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone marrow harvest. The bone marrow is treated with c-myb
      antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and cryopreserved. A portion of the marrow is cryopreserved
      untreated in case of engraftment failure. Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on
      days -7 to -4 for a total of 16 doses. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      days -3 and -2. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients
      are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
