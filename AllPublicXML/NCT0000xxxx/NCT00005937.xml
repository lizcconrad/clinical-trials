  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of a combination of the
      immune-suppressing drugs antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine for treating
      myelodysplasia, a disorder of low blood cell counts. It will: evaluate whether this drug
      combination can increase blood counts in patients and reduce their need for transfusions;
      compare survival of patients who respond to ATG and cyclosporine treatment with those who do
      not respond; and determine the side effects of the treatment.

      Myelodysplasia is thought to result from an immune system abnormality in which cells called
      lymphocytes attack the marrow's blood-forming cells. The resulting deficiencies of platelets
      and red and white blood cells cause anemia, susceptibility to infections, and easy bruising
      and bleeding. Various therapies, such as blood transfusions for anemia and bleeding,
      antibiotics for infection, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation are used to treat
      myelodysplasia, but all have disadvantages and some carry serious risks.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with myelodysplasia may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, blood tests,
      chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and bone marrow biopsy (removal of a marrow sample from the
      hipbone for microscopic examination).

      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first 10 to 14 days of
      treatment and will then continue therapy on an outpatient basis. They will undergo the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Placement of central line-An intravenous (IV) catheter (flexible tube inserted into a
           vein) is placed in a large vein of the neck, chest or arm. Medicines are delivered
           through this line and blood samples are drawn from it.

        -  ATG skin testing- ATG is injected under the skin to check for sensitization to horse
           serum, from which the drug is derived.

        -  ATG treatment-Four doses of ATG are given through the IV line on each of 4 consecutive
           days. Prednisone is taken by mouth beginning the first day of ATG therapy and continuing
           for a total of 17 days. This drug is given to reduce the side effects of ATG, such as
           fever, skin rash and chills.

        -  Cyclosporine treatment- Cyclosporine capsules are taken by mouth twice a day for at
           least 6 months.

      During hospitalization, blood will be drawn daily for blood counts and other tests. Upon the
      patient's discharge after 10 days, the referring physician will do blood tests weekly during
      the first month of treatment and then every 2 weeks for the rest of the time the patient is
      taking cyclosporine. Dosages of this drug may be adjusted depending on the test results.
      Patients will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center at 3-month intervals for the first
      year, then every 6 months for the next 3 years and then at yearly intervals. A blood sample
      will be drawn at each visit. Bone marrow biopsies will be done at 6-month intervals for the
      first 3 years after treatment.

      A growing body of laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that the cytopenia of MDS is at
      least partly a result of cytotoxic T cell activity. Treatments to abrogate T cell activity
      such as anti-thymocyte globulin alone and cyclosporine alone have demonstrated varying
      degrees of success in alleviating the cytopenia of MDS. A response to such therapy in MDS is
      associated with improved survival. Experience with aplastic anemia suggests that the
      combination of these two agents should be more effective in suppressing cytotoxic T cell
      activity and alleviating cytopenia. This protocol proposes using the combination of
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA) to treat the cytopenia of MDS, in an
      effort to improve the response rate to immunosuppressive therapy in this disease.

    <description>Red blood cell transfusion independence was documented as time from last transfusion of red cells to last day of transfusion free follow-up. Independence or response to the intervention was assessed by weekly blood counts. Transfusion independence was defined as no transfusion requirement for a 3 month period. Complete hematologic response is defined as the normalization of affected cells lines and less than 5% marrow blasts present. Partial hematologic response is defined as greater than 50% improvement from baseline to normal levels of all cell counts and greater than 50% decrease in marrow blasts.</description>

The taper schedule will be every two days over a total of eight days (days 10-17). Drug the ATG administration the subjects will receive at least 4 units of platelets daily for platelet counts less than 20,000/ microliters. Cyclosporine (CsA) will be started on day 14 at a dose of 5mg/kg twice daily with dose adjustments based on drug levels (target 200-400 ng/ml).

        <title>Red Blood Cell Transfusion Independence</title>
        <description>Red blood cell transfusion independence was documented as time from last transfusion of red cells to last day of transfusion free follow-up. Independence or response to the intervention was assessed by weekly blood counts. Transfusion independence was defined as no transfusion requirement for a 3 month period. Complete hematologic response is defined as the normalization of affected cells lines and less than 5% marrow blasts present. Partial hematologic response is defined as greater than 50% improvement from baseline to normal levels of all cell counts and greater than 50% decrease in marrow blasts.</description>

            <description>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) subjects will be treated with Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA). The subjects will receive ATG at a dose of 40mg/kg orally on days 1-4 in combination with oral prednisone at a dose of 1mg/kg/day on day one. The prednisone will be tapered on day 10. The taper schedule will be every two days over a total of eight days (days 10-17). Drug the ATG administration the subjects will receive at least 4 units of platelets daily for platelet counts less than 20,000/ microliters. Cyclosporine (CsA) will be started on day 14 at a dose of 5mg/kg twice daily with dose adjustments based on drug levels (target 200-400 ng/ml). Cyclosporine therapy will be continued for six months.</description>
