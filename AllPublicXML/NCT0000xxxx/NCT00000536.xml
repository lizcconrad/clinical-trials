      To compare the effects of two levels of dietary sodium on blood pressure in Black men and
      women, and to determine what factors predict the degree of response.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study permitted a more precise estimate of the effects of sodium chloride on blood
      pressure in Blacks and a systematic examination of sodium sensitivity defined by various
      methods. The results had significance in answering questions about risk factors for blood
      pressure in Blacks and for defining sodium sensitivity.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Double-blind, two-period cross-over. All participants were given six weeks of intensive
      nutritional counseling to lower 24-hour urine sodium output from an estimated 165 mEq/24
      hours at baseline to less than 140 mEq/24 hours. Only those participants who excreted less
      than 140 mEq /24 hours after six weeks of intensive dietary sodium intervention and had
      greater than 70 percent adherence to study capsules were eligible for randomization. Eligible
      subjects were assigned to one of two treatment sequences: 100 mEq of sodium chloride capsules
      per day during period one followed by placebo capsules during period two; placebo capsules
      during period one followed by 100 mEq of sodium chloride capsules per day during period two.
      The major endpoint was change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure. A number of other
      measures were carried out, including blood chemistries, glucose tolerance (glucose and
      insulin), insulin resistance, urinary kallikrein, serum renin, and plasma norepinephrine.
      Other major aims of the trial included testing general new diagnostic criteria for sodium
      sensitivity, examining predictors of sodium sensitivity, and examining how changes in sodium
      intake influenced change in specific metabolic parameters. The trial design incorporated
      careful control of the dietary changes and strict standardization of blood pressure
      measurement with a random-zero device. The study was extended through June 1997 on FY 1995
      funds.
