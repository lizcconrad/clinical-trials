      This study will examine the use of etanercept (also called Enbrel or TNFR:Fc) in patients
      with Wegener's granulomatosis, a type of vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation). Wegener's
      granulomatosis may affect many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses,
      lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart, and other sites. Generally, the
      greater the disease involvement, the more life-threatening it is. Standard treatment is a
      combination of prednisone and a cytotoxic agent-usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate.
      However, many patients treated with this regimen have a disease relapse, and others cannot
      take these drugs because of severe side effects. This study will evaluate etanercept's safety
      and effectiveness, and particularly its value in reducing the need for prednisone and
      preventing disease relapse.

      The Food and Drug Administration has approved etanercept for treating rheumatoid arthritis,
      another inflammatory disease. The drug works by blocking the activity of TNF-a protein made
      by white blood cells that is involved in the inflammatory process. Since prednisone also
      affects inflammatory proteins and lowers TNF production, the use of etanercept may reduce the
      need for prednisone in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, and thus the risk of its side
      effects.

      Patients between 10 and 70 years of age with Wegener's granulomatosis who have never taken
      prednisone, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, or have taken these drugs for less than 3 weeks
      may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will have a medical history review and physical examination, including
      laboratory studies. If medically indicated, X-rays, consultations and biopsies (surgical
      removal of a small tissue sample) of affected organs will also be done. All patients will
      begin treatment with prednisone, methotrexate and etanercept. Those who improve on this
      regimen will stop prednisone gradually over 3 months. Those who achieve disease remission at
      the end of another 3 months will be randomly assigned to either continue taking etanercept
      and methotrexate for another 12 months or to stop etanercept and continue only methotrexate
      for the next 12 months (after which methotrexate will gradually be stopped). Patients who are
      not in remission by the 6-month point will continue taking etanercept until they go into
      remission, when they will be assigned to stop or not stop etanercept, as described above.
      Patients who do not achieve remission within 12 months of beginning treatment will be taken
      off the study. Patients who have a disease relapse while on the study will likely be switched
      to treatment with prednisone and either methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. Patients randomized
      to stop etanercept and who have a relapse within a year of stopping the drug may be offered
      re-treatment on this protocol, but with continuing etanercept for a full year after
      remission.

      Patients will be evaluated in the outpatient clinic every 2 to 4 weeks for the first 4 months
      and every 1 to 3 months after that. Patients whose disease is in remission and who stop all
      medications will be followed every 3 to 6 months for 2 years. Follow-up evaluations include a
      physical examination, blood draws and, if medically indicated, X-rays. The total study
      duration is 60 to 70 months.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunologic effects
      of a recombinant fusion protein that consists of the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor
      linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (TNFR:Fc) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. A
      secondary objective is to determine if TNFR:Fc demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity in the
      treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis. Specifically, we will seek to examine whether TNFR:Fc
      is able to reduce the need for glucocorticoid treatment and lower relapse rates. Patients
      will be eligible to participate in this protocol when there is evidence that the disease is
      active but is not immediately life-threatening. In this study, patients will receive TNFR:Fc
      (25mg subcutaneously twice weekly) together with methotrexate and prednisone. In all patients
      the prednisone will be tapered over a 3 month schedule. At the end of 6 months, patients in
      remission will be randomized to either continue TNFR:Fc for another 12 months or stop. All
      patients will continue methotrexate for 1 year after they enter remission after which time it
      will be tapered and discontinued.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Documentation of Wegener's granulomatosis based on clinical characteristics and
        histopathologic and/or angiographic evidence of vasculitis. In the absence of
        histopathologic and/or angiographic evidence of vasculitis, patients who meet one of the
        following criteria and in whom infectious and autoimmune diseases that may mimic Wegener's
        granulomatosis or a related systemic vasculitides have been excluded will also be eligible:

        presence of glomerulonephritis defined by red blood cell casts and proteinuria or renal
        biopsy showing necrotizing glomerulonephritis in the absence of immune deposits; b) a
        positive assay for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (C- or P-ANCA) and the
