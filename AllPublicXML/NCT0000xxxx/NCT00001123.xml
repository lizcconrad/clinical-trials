  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test the safety and effectiveness of intravenous ribavirin therapy in
      persons with suspected and subsequently proven hantavirus infection. The hantavirus is spread
      through the air into the lungs when dry rodent feces are moved or disturbed. It is
      characterized by fever and bleeding.

      Patients are randomized to receive either ribavirin or a placebo for 7 days. At the
      completion of therapy, patients will be seen on follow-up visits on days 14, 28, and 84.
