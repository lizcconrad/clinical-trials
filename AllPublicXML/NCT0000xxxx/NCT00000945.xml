  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and overall effectiveness of
      cidovir to treat PML in AIDS patients.

      PML is an opportunistic infection (HIV-associated, due to weak immune system) caused by a
      virus that attacks the brain. Cidovir has been used effectively to treat cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) of the eye. Cidovir could be an effective treatment for PML as well.

      PML is a demyelinating disease of the brain's white matter, occurring when the JC virus
      infects the brain of patients infected with HIV-1. Cidofovir is known to be an effective
      treatment for cytomegalovirus of the eye and, in laboratory and animal testing, has also been
      shown to be effective against several other viruses. However, cidofovir is considered
      investigational as a treatment for PML.

      In this multicenter, open-label study 24 patients receive cidofovir iv over 1 hr on days 0,
      7, then every 2 wk for a total of 13 doses.

      Oral probenecid is given 3h prior to and 2h and 8h following cidofovir administration.
      Nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptors are withheld on days of probenecid
      administration. Protease inhibitors are continued during probenecid administration.
