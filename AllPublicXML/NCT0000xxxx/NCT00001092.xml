    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of HIV in the blood, genital fluid, and
      saliva of the partners of patients with early HIV infection. This study will also look at the
      strength of the immune systems of patients with early HIV infection.

      Because HIV multiplies very quickly in the early stages of infection, patients with early HIV
      infection may be more likely to transmit HIV to their partners. The amount of HIV in blood,
      genital fluid, and saliva may determine the risk for transmission.

      Persons with early HIV infection may represent high transmission risk to their partners.
      Early infection, characterized by rapid virologic replication, insufficient immunologic
      control of infection, and more rapid course of disease progression, may be associated with
      increased infectiousness. The viral determinants of transmission may in part be explained by
      viral burden in blood, genital fluids, and oral cavity fluids. All three fluids may be the
      source for transmitted virus.

      Persons with suspected HIV infection are asked to identify their possible source partners.
      The importance of partner referral is emphasized and assisted recruitment or active tracing
      is offered if necessary. Source partners will not be approached uninvited. If a partner
      states that he/she does not want to be contacted, then he/she will not be contacted further
      for the purpose of this study or for any other study. All patients are offered HIV counseling
      and plasma testing for HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ cells. Blood specimens are collected for plasma
      determination, and cellular and plasma fractions are collected for CAF and neutralization
      antibodies. Neutralization assays are used to detect humoral immune response in patients with
      primary HIV infection. Genital fluids and saliva are analyzed for viral RNA. Patients are
      seen in the clinic on Day 1 for blood draw and return 2 weeks later for blood test results. A
      follow-up period of at least 4 weeks is planned. Compensation is provided to all patients.
