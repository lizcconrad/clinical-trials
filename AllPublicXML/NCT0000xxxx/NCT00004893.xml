      RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill breast cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating
      patients who have metastatic or recurrent breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of interleukin-12 as defined by the percentage of
      patients who have not progressed after 6 months of therapy. II. Compare percentage of
      patients who have not progressed after six months with or without treatment regimen. III.
      Determine time to progression and overall survival in this patient population after this
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease free
      interval from primary diagnosis to first metastases (less than 3 years vs 3 years and
      longer), estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), and disease status (complete
      response, partial response, detectable disease, or stable disease). Patients are randomized
      to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients begin therapy no sooner than 3 weeks and no
      later than 6 weeks since last chemotherapy dose. Patients receive interleukin-12
      subcutaneously twice a week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year. If no
      progression after 1 year, may be followed as needed for new signs or symptoms and survival
      for 5 years. Arm II: Patients are observed for 6 months. If disease progresses during first 6
      months, patients may receive interleukin-12 as in arm I. Patients without disease progression
      within first 6 months may also then receive interleukin-12 as in arm I. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for
      toxicity only until interleukin-12 is discontinued.
