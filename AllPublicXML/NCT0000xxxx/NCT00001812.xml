  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who are receiving intravenous high dose Interleukin-2, patients will be
      randomized into two groups: group one will receive nystatin swish and swallow immediately
      before initiation of IL-2, and the second group will receive a placebo. The patients in each
      group will be monitored and evaluated for differences in the rate and severity of development
      of oral irritation during treatment. They will also be studied for differences between the
      two groups in the number of doses of IL-2 taken.

        All patients enrolled on high dose intravenous interleukin-2 studies in the Surgery Branch
        of the National Cancer Institute are eligible, except for patients who are receiving
        adoptively transferred cells (cloned peripheral blood cells).

        All inclusion criteria as stated in the parent immunotherapy protocol apply:

        No patients with evidence of oral irritation prior to starting therapy;

        No patients with any known sensitivity to nystatin;

        No patients receiving systemic antifungals;

        No patients with active oral infections.

        In additional, all exclusion criteria as stated in the parent immunotherapy protocol.
