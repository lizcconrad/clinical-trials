  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and effectiveness of SCH 39304 as primary treatment of acute
      cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients. Safety and effectiveness of maintenance
      therapy following successful treatment of acute disease are also evaluated.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is a significant cause of illness and death in HIV-infected patients.
      Intravenous amphotericin B is effective for acute disease but relapse occurs in the majority
      of patients. Maintenance therapy is recommended but must be balanced against the multiple
      toxicities of the drugs used and the problems associated with the weekly administration of
      intravenous therapy. Treatments that are equally or more effective and less toxic than
      traditional methods are needed, especially oral therapy. SCH 39304 is an orally active
      antifungal drug that in animal studies is active against a wide range of systemic fungal
      infections including infections due to Cryptococcus. Features of SCH 39304 suggest that it
      might be of value in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is a significant cause of illness and death in HIV-infected patients.
      Intravenous amphotericin B is effective for acute disease but relapse occurs in the majority
      of patients. Maintenance therapy is recommended but must be balanced against the multiple
      toxicities of the drugs used and the problems associated with the weekly administration of

      might be of value in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

      HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of acute cryptococcal meningitis, previously untreated
      or relapsed following a successfully treated acute episode, are enrolled in the study. SCH
      39304 is administered orally once daily for 3 days followed by a lower dose once daily for 12
      weeks. Patients who respond to primary therapy are randomized to receive SCH 39304
      maintenance therapy at a higher dose once weekly or at the lower dose once daily for up to 12
      months under this protocol.

             drug levels.

          -  Coumarin-type anticoagulants if investigator agrees to rigorously monitor prothrombin
             time.

          -  Prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Patients must be HIV positive by 2 methodologies and have either primary cryptococcal
        meningitis with no prior anti-cryptococcal therapy or relapsed disease after prior therapy.

          -  Prior therapy for cryptococcal meningitis is limited to approved drugs.

          -  Written informed consent either from patient or patient's parent or legal guardian is
             required.

          -  Central nervous system disease.

          -  Acute opportunistic infection.

          -  Underlying conditions that in the opinion of the investigator could preclude

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic antifungal drugs other than study drug.
