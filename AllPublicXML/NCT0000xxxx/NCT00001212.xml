      Studies have shown that up to 26% of patients with systemic lupus erythematoses nephritis may
      suffer from membranous lupus nephropathy. The disease is characterized by high levels of
      protein in the urine and may eventually lead to kidney failure.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and toxic effects of immunosuppressive drug
      therapy in patients with membranous lupus nephropathy over a 12 month period. The major goal
      of this therapy is to decrease protein losses and ultimately prevent kidney failure.

      Patients enrolled in the study will undergo a routine history and physical examination. In
      addition, several diagnostic tests will be conducted including; chest x-ray ECG, blood and
      urine laboratory tests.

      Patients will be divided and grouped according to the severity of their disease as shown by
      kidney function. Each group will then randomly be subcategorized by different treatment
      plans. Each treatment plan will made up of immunosuppressive medications including
      prednisone, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, and combinations of these drugs. Patients will
      receive the medications as directed by the study.

      The study will last 12 months and require patients to be admitted for two to five days before
      the study begins and once the study is completed. Patients will be followed as outpatients
      throughout the 12 month study.

      This is a phase 2 trial to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of immunosuppressive drug
      therapy in patients with membranous lupus nephropathy over a 12 month study period. Patients
      with renal biopsy documented membranous nephropathy will all be treated with alternate day
      prednisone and will be randomized to receive: a) no additional therapy (control group), b)
      intravenous cyclophosphamide up to 1.0 gm per m(2) body surface area every other month for 6
      total doses, or c) oral cyclosporin A up to 200 mg per m(2) body surface area daily for a
      total of 11 months. Patients with glomerular filtration rates 25-66 ml/min will be randomized
      only to prednisone alone or to prednisone plus cyclophosphamide. Renal function and disease
      activity will be monitored throughout the study; physiologic measures of glomerular function
      (GFR, permselectivity) will be examined at study entry and at the conclusion of the study.
      Comparison will be made of the number of favorable outcomes of glomerular function as well as
      drug related toxicities achieved by each treatment group at the end of the 12th study month.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - All patients admitted to the study must satisfy each of the following
        criteria:

        Ability to provide informed consent to all aspects of the study after full information is
        provided.

        SLE as defined by the presence of at least 4 criteria established by the American
        Rheumatism Association.

        Age 12 years or older.

        Membranous lupus nephropathy manifested by 2 or more grams per day of proteinuria in the
        absence of infection or recognized non-lupus renal disease. A renal biopsy must reveal
        typical membranous lupus nephropathy by light microscopy. Immune deposits must be
        predominately sub-epithelial and/or intramembranous in location by electron microscopy.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Patients with any one of the following conditions will be excluded:
