      BACKGROUND:

      The Framingham Heart Study is a major epidemiological investigation of prospective
      relationships between risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD risk
      factors) and CVD risk factor outcomes. The Framingham Study and other large, prospective
      studies have resulted in an extensive literature on the impact of CVD risk factors (including
      age) and CVD outcomes. Comparatively, there have been many fewer studies of the impact of CVD
      risk factors on cognitive functioning, and possibly no studies of the effect of objectively
      measured, competing risk factors on cognitive functioning.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Dr. Elias and colleagues used cardiovascular risk factor data from the Framingham Heart Study
      (N= 2,123) in a prospective design allowing them to relate CVD risk factors (including age
      and gender) to two outcome measures: (1) level of cognitive performance and (2) change in
      cognitive performance over a 10 year longitudinal study period. The overall goals were to
      determine the best multivariate combination of biological and psychosocial risk factors for
      the prediction of lowered cognitive ability in middle-aged and elderly men and women, and to
      evaluate the relative impact of age, gender, and other biological and psychosocial risk
      factors on cognitive functioning.
