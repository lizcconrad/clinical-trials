      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating patients who have
      liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in terms of antitumor response,
      response duration, and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. II. Assess the
      quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.
      III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DX-8951 in plasma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
