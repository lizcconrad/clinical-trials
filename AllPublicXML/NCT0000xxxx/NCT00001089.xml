    <textblock>
      To define relationships between 1) HIV load and risk of CMV disease, 2) CMV load and the risk
      of developing CMV disease, and 3) CMV load and HIV load. To establish threshold CMV and HIV
      load values in peripheral blood fractions that are associated with development of CMV
      end-organ disease. To define the natural history of CMV diseases in the context of highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

      Establishment of threshold CMV and HIV load values associated with CMV disease would
      facilitate identification of HIV-infected individuals truly at risk for CMV disease in whom
      targeted prophylactic interventions to prevent CMV disease would be indicated. These studies
      would also further the understanding of the natural history of CMV disease within the context
      of AIDS. Natural history studies conducted prior to the advent of highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART; i.e., 3-drug regimens that include HIV reverse transcriptase
      and protease inhibitors) have demonstrated that the risk for developing CMV disease increases
      with progression of HIV disease and with declining CD4 counts. Presently the need exists to
      define the natural history of CMV disease in patients with AIDS within the context of HAART.

      In this prospective observational study, HIV-infected patients who are CMV-seropositive with
      no clinical symptoms of CMV disease at entry are followed for three years or until the
      diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease or death, whichever comes first. Clinical evaluations are
      performed at baseline and every 8 weeks. Blood samples for virologic studies are taken every
      16 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Antivirals with anti-CMV activity (such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir,
             valganciclovir, foscarnet, etc.) for reasons other than treatment of CMV disease.

          -  Antivirals for prophylaxis or treatment of other herpesvirus infections.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV-1 infection.

          -  Documented evidence of CD4 count &lt;= 50 cells/mm3 in the previous 24 months.

          -  Presence of serum CMV IgG antibodies.

          -  No history of CMV end-organ disease or evidence of active CMV disease prior to study
             entry. NOTE: A history of positive CMV urine or blood cultures is acceptable as long
             as it has been determined that the patient does not have CMV end-organ disease.

          -  Signed, informed consent of parent or legal guardian for patients less than 18 years
             of age.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Ocular media opacities that preclude adequate visualization of the fundi.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of CMV end-organ disease.

          -  Any pre-existing necrotizing retinopathy that may interfere with a subsequent
             diagnosis of CMV retinitis.
