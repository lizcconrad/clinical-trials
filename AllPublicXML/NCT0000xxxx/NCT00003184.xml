      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from breast cancer cells may make the body build an immune response
      to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccines made from breast cancer cells
      in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of vaccination strategies employing a CD80-transfected
           allogeneic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231).

        -  Assess the immunologic response of lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes draining the
           vaccination site following a single dose of CD80-transfected MDA-MB-231.

        -  Assess the development of systemic immunity following multiple injections of
           CD80-transfected MDA-MB-231.

        -  Observe for tumor regression.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive intradermal vaccinations containing CD80-transfected cells with or without
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) or with or without BCG. Vaccinations are administered every 2 weeks for
      6 weeks and then monthly for 3 months. Patients may receive 1 of 2 different doses of GM-CSF.
      GM-CSF is administered with the vaccination, then every 12 hours for 7 days. Monthly
      vaccinations may continue as long as response is shown.

      Cohorts of 5 patients each are treated at each dose/combination. Each cohort completes
      treatment before the next cohort is accrued.

      Patients are followed at weeks 4 and 8, then every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
