  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of concurrent administration of standard-dose didanosine
      (ddI) with low-dose ribavirin in HIV-positive patients. To determine the pharmacokinetic
      interactions of concurrent administration of ddI and ribavirin and correlate pharmacokinetic
      parameters with toxicity. To investigate antiviral activity of the combined regimen.

      Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy, if safe and effective, offers an alternative combination
      antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT).

    <textblock>
      Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy, if safe and effective, offers an alternative combination
      antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT).

      Patients receive ddI alone for 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of combination ddI/ribavirin.
      Patients who complete the first 12 weeks without major toxicity may receive an additional 12
      weeks of combination therapy on an optional basis. Patients are followed for 60 days after
      the last treatment visit.
