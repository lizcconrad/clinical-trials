      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs such as phosphorus 32 may be able to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of phosphorus 32 in
      treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dosimetry toxicity of interstitial colloidal phosphorus P32 (C P32) in
           patients with recurrent or poor prognosis grade 4 astrocytoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of C P32 administered directly into the tumor of
           these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated fractionated dose of interstitial C P32 in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the therapeutic response rate to the acceptable single and fractionated doses
           of C P32 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive interstitial colloidal phosphorus P32 (C P32) on day 0. Courses repeat every
      4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of C P32 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined the dose at which 2 of 3 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 15, and 24 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
