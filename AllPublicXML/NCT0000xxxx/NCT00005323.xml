      BACKGROUND:

      The study on the epidemiology of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) was
      a subproject within a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) in Lung Biology and Diseases in
      Infants and Children. The SCOR and its subproject were awarded in December, 1991. Dollars
      were estimated at 20 percent of total center dollars.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data from a previous study of PPHN were analyzed. The objectives were to: identify the
      effects of a variety of potentially adverse prenatal exposures from interview data; formulate
      multi-variate models of risk of PPHN to determine if smoking or use of prostaglandin
      inhibitors increased the risk of PPHN; explore associations of PPHN with history of illicit
      drug use and maternal hypoxia; examine the relationships of postnatal care and perinatal risk
      factors on the incidence and outcome of PPHN; test the relationships of PPHN to the
      biochemical presence of nicotine and drugs in neonatal urine.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
