  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have documented an essential role for interleukin-10 (IL-10) in preventing
      prolonged and exaggerated immune responses to antigens and irritants. Psoriasis, a relatively
      common disease, is characterized by T cell-mediated inflammation in affected skin. In this
      study, the safety, tolerance, immunologic effects, and clinical activity of subcutaneous (SC)
      recombinant human (rh) IL-10 will be evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
      There will be 2 groups of patients, randomized to receive either 20 ug/kg rhIL-10 SC 3 times
      weekly (20 patients) or SC placebo (10 patients). This double-blind phase will continue for a
      total of 12 weeks and the principal evaluation will be the comparison between baseline and 12
      week Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores. Patients will come for an initial screening
      visit at day 0, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, with follow-up visits at weeks 16 and 20.

      All patients will be offered rhIL-10 at 12 weeks (following the blinded portion of the study
      protocol). Patients initially receiving active medication who wish to continue rhIL-10
      therapy will be kept on the drug. This open-label portion of the study will continue for an
      additional 12 weeks. Patients continuing with active drug will be evaluated at weeks 14, 16,
      20, and 24.

      Skin disease activity and toxicity will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. In
      addition, research studies will include functional assays to assess cytokine secretion and
      immunologic function of peripheral blood cells and immunohistochemical characterization of
      the inflammatory cells in skin.

      recombinant human (rh) IL-10 will be evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
      There will be 2 groups of patients, randomized to receive either 20 (micro)g/kg rhIL-10 SC 3
      times weekly (20 patients) or SC placebo (10 patients). This double-blind phase will continue
      for a total of 12 weeks and the principal evaluation will be the comparison between baseline

      to an additional 12 weeks. Patients continuing with active drug will be evaluated at weeks
      14, 16, 20, and 24.

        provided.

        Age equal to or between 18 and 65 years.

        Moderate-to-severe stable plaque psoriasis of at least 6 months duration as defined by the
        following criteria: 1) Classic psoriatic skin lesions with or without nail involvement, 2)
        Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score greater than 10(i), 3) Total body surface area
        involved greater than 10%.

        Weight less than 242 pounds.

        Must be able to self-administer medication (subcutaneous injection) or arrange for
        administration.

        No unstable psoriatic disease, including erythrodermic, pustular, and palmar/plantar
        variants.

        No use of topical medications for psoriasis (except for bland emollients) during 2 weeks

        No patients with acute or chronic infections requiring antimicrobial therapy or serious
        viral (e.g., hepatitis, herpes zoster, or HIV) or fungal infections as the effects of IL-10
        on the immune system not completely elucidated and treatment could pose additional risk to
        the patient. Patients with a positive PPD who have not received antituberculous therapy may
        be excluded, if in the opinion of an infectious consultant, IL-10 treatment is
        contraindicated.

        No patients receiving disease modifying anti-inflammatory drugs (methotrexate,
        sulfasalazine, gold, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporin, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,
        chlorambucil, retinoids, vitamin D). Such drugs will be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior
        to randomization.

        No pregnant females, nursing mothers, or patients of childbearing age not practicing birth
        control, since the risks to the unborn fetus and newborn child are unknown.

        basal-squamous cell carcinoma or in situ cervical carcinoma.

        equal to 28% or platelet counts less than 100,000/ml], neurologic, renal, or pulmonary
        disease).

        No patients with serum creatinine greater than 1.8 or creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than
        50 ml/min.

        No patients with abnormal liver function tests (e.g., serum glumatic oxalacetic
        transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase levels greater
        than 2.5x upper limit of normal (UNL) and/or bilirubin levels 1.5x UNL).

        No current alcohol or drug abuse.
