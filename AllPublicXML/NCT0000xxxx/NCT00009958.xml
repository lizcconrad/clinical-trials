    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without sargramostim in
      treating patients who have solid tumors. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response
      to kill tumor cells. Combining colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim with vaccines
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of the novel CEA-based
      vaccine, rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (recombinant fowlpox-CEA(6D)-B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3), either alone or
      in combination with a second vaccine, rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (recombinant
      vaccinia-CEA(6D)-B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3) in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of the novel CEA-based
      vaccine rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM when given in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of
      rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM, in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.

      III. To determine the safety and impact of colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF) on the
      immunologic response, when given in conjunction with the combination of rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM
      (MTD) and rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (MTD) vaccines, in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.

      IV. To determine the change in CAP-1 directed T cells in patients treated with these vaccines
      using ELISPOT assay analysis.

      V. To perform a pilot analysis of the impact of vaccine therapy on the quantity of
      circulating CEA-positive cells in the patients treated on this study in order to develop and
      eventually validate a practical, intermediate bio-marker for the immunologic response to the
      vaccines.

      VI. To document any objective anti-tumor responses that occur.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM (fCEA-TRI) vaccine and
      vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM (vCEA-TRI) vaccine.

      STAGE I: Patients receive fCEA-TRI vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1, 29, 57,
      and 85.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of the fCEA-TRI vaccine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      STAGE II: Patients receive vCEA-TRI vaccine intradermally once on day 1 and fCEA-TRI vaccine
      SC at the MTD determined in stage I once daily on days 29, 57, and 85.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of the vCEA-TRI vaccine until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      DLT.

      STAGE III: A single cohort of 6-10 patients receive both vaccines as in stage II, at the MTDs
      determined in stages I and II, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC once daily on days 1-4, 29-32,
      57-60, and 85-88.

      Patients in any stage of the study with responding disease may receive additional doses of
      the fCEA-TRI vaccine monthly for 2 months and then every 3 months thereafter. Patients who
      have objective evidence of response (including mixed response) and/or a fall in an elevated
      serum CEA level after the sixth vaccine and who subsequently develop disease progression
      while on the extended every 3-month treatment schedule and have no other potentially better
      treatment alternatives available may continue treatment as per the monthly vaccination
      schedule for 2 additional months. Patients with stable or responding disease after those two
      monthly vaccines may continue monthly vaccines at the discretion of the principal
      investigator.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then monthly for 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy, with evidence
             of metastatic disease (evaluable disease is adequate), who have not responded to
             standard therapy, who have relapsed, or for whom such therapy is not available

          -  Patients must have a tumor that has been shown to express CEA by immunohistochemical
             techniques or have had an elevated serum CEA &gt; 10 at any point during their disease
             course

          -  Patients must have an anticipated survival of at least 6 months

          -  Patients must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of
             the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects), and must
             sign an informed consent

          -  Patients must be ambulatory, with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and must be
             maintaining a reasonable state of nutrition, consistent with weight maintenance

          -  WBC &gt;= 3,000/mm^3

          -  ANC &gt;= 1500/mm^3

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2 x upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT and SGPT =&lt; 4 x upper limit of normal

          -  All patients should have an initial urine analysis; the initial urine analysis for
             eligibility is: proteinuria grade 0, hematuria grade 0, and no abnormal sediment; any
             positive protein including trace values should be evaluated by a 24-hour urine; any
             other abnormality in the sediment or the presence of hematuria should be evaluated by
             a nephrologist for evidence of underlying renal pathology; patients may be eligible if
             the underlying cause of the abnormality is determined to be non-renal

          -  Normal creatinine is defined by creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             ml/min

          -  At least 6 patients must be HLA-A2 positive for each of cohorts 3, 6, and 7; once the
             HLA-A2 positive quota of 6 has been met, enrollment to that cohort may close at the
             discretion of the principal investigator; there are no HLA phenotype restrictions for
             cohorts 1,2,4, and 5, although phenotyping will be performed on all patients

          -  Vaccinia-naïve patients may be enrolled to any cohort

               -  There must be no history of allergy or untoward reaction to prior vaccination
                  with vaccinia virus, for patients on cohorts 4, 5, 6, or 7

          -  Patients for all cohorts should have no evidence of immunocompromise or autoimmunity
             as defined by:

               -  HIV negative by serologic testing; this requirement is due to the potential for
                  an unacceptable high risk of systemic viremia, if live virus vaccine were to be
                  administered to an immunocompromised individual; while similar constructs have
                  been given to HIV positive patients, concern is high for toxicity, particularly
                  with vaccinia

               -  No other diagnosis (past or present) of:

                    -  Altered immune function, including immunodeficiency or history of
                       immunodeficiency; eczema; history of eczema, or other eczematoid skin
                       disorders; or those with acute, chronic or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g.
                       atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, severe acne, or other
                       open rashes or wounds; this requirement is due to a potential unacceptable
                       high risk of systemic viremia, if study vaccine were to be administered to
                       an immunocompromised individual

                    -  Any autoimmune disease such as, Addison's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
                       or systemic lupus erythematous, Sjogren syndrome, scleroderma, myasthenia
                       gravis, Goodpasture syndrome active Grave's disease; this requirement is due
                       to the potential risks of autoimmunity

               -  No prior radiation to &gt; 50% of all nodal groups

               -  No concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses for systemic
                  steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use

          -  Patients must have recovered from the reversible side effects of prior therapy

          -  Patients must be willing and able to travel to Georgetown University Hospital for
             treatment and follow-up during therapy and at least monthly thereafter until there is
             evidence of disease progression

          -  Patients must be able to avoid close household contact (close household contacts are
             those who share housing or have close physical contact) with persons with active or a
             history of eczema or other eczematoid skin disorders; those with other acute, chronic
             or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, varicella
             zoster, severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds) until condition resolves;
             pregnant or nursing women; children under 5 years of age; and immunodeficient or
             immunosuppressed persons (by disease or therapy), including HIV infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent major surgery (within 21 days)

          -  Frequent vomiting or severe anorexia

          -  Pregnant or lactating women; this requirement is due to an unacceptable high risk of
             CEA antibody transfer, which may be potentially harmful to the developing fetus or
             infant; (NOTE: women and men enrolled in the study are to practice an effective method
             of birth control for at least six months after their last treatment on protocol)

          -  Serious intercurrent medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the
             patient to carry out the treatment program, including, but not limited to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active
             diverticulitis

          -  The following therapies are prohibited and may not be administered to patients being
             treated on this protocol: chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, and
             immunotherapy

          -  Patients must have recovered completely from any reversible toxicity associated with
             their most recent therapy; typically this is 3-4 weeks for patients who most recently
             received cytotoxic therapy except for the nitrosoureas and mitomycin C for which 6
             weeks is needed for recovery

          -  Patients with clinically active brain metastasis, uncontrolled seizure disorders,
             encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis

          -  Patients can not have any history (past or present) of allergy to eggs or egg products

          -  Patients with history of receiving CEA-containing vaccines are excluded from
             enrollment into any of the 8 actual study cohorts; however, patients with metastatic
             disease who have progressed (as defined by objective response criteria for solid
             measurable tumor; tumor marker elevation alone is not sufficient) on a CEA-containing
             vaccine, may be enrolled to this study as they arise if they meet the patient
             eligibility criteria, but will be added-in outside of the eight established cohorts,
             at the currently established safe dose level; additionally, these patients will
             receive only the rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine (possibly along with GM-CSF if cohort 7 is
             the currently established safe dose level), but otherwise will be treated according to
             the protocol as any other patient on study; such additional patients will not count
             toward study accrual, determination of primary immunologic endpoints, or the
             determination of the MTD
