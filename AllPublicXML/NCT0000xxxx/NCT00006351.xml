      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining SCH 66336 and gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SCH 66336 plus gemcitabine in treating
      patients who have advanced cancer of the urinary tract.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of SCH 66336 and gemcitabine in patients with
           advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract.

        -  Determine the time to progression and objective response rate of this treatment regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral SCH 66336 twice
      a day (starting on day 2 of the first course, and starting on day 1 of all subsequent
      courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-31 patients will be accrued for this study.
