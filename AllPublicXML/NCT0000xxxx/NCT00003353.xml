      RATIONALE: High-dose chemotherapy may destroy the amyloid-producing cells in bone marrow.
      Peripheral stem cell transplantation

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high dose melphalan plus peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have primary systemic amyloidosis.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate and overall survival of patients with biopsy proven
      primary amyloidosis following treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy and hematopoietic
      stem cell reconstitution. II. Evaluate the toxicity of high dose melphalan in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 1 of the
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection period and continuing until PBSC collection is
      completed. PBSC are collected beginning on day 5 of the collection period and continuing
      until the final target cell count is reached or for up to a maximum of 7 collections. If
      sufficient PBSCs are not harvested within a maximum of 7 collections, the patient is removed
      from the study. Within 30 days of PBSC collection, patients receive melphalan IV on day -1 of
      the infusion period and PBSC infusion on day 0. The infusion period continues until day 30.
      Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily starting on day 1 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 3
      additional years, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
