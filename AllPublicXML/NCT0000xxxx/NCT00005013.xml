  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the acute efficacy and safety of a standardized extract
      of the herb Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), called hypericum for purposes of this
      trial, in the treatment of patients with major depression.

      Clinical depression is a serious medical disorder that can be debilitating and can lead to
      suicide. There is growing public interest in claims that hypericum may be an effective
      treatment for depression. Although it is widely prescribed in Europe, no studies of its
      long-term use have been conducted, and published studies have treated different types of
      patients and have used several different doses. The toxicity and side effects of hypericum
      appear to be substantially less than those of standard tricyclic antidepressant medications,
      and thus hypericum may be more acceptable to patients. In addition, the cost is significantly
      less than standard antidepressant medications. Published studies assessed acute efficacy and
      lasted between 4 and 12 weeks (most being 4-6 weeks). The longer-term effects of hypericum
      have not been evaluated. There is a need for a large-scale, controlled clinical trial to
      assess whether Hypericum has a significant therapeutic effect in patients with clinical
      depression.

      Patients are assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive St. John's wort, Sertraline
      (Zoloft), or a placebo (sugar pill) for 8 weeks. This is a double-blind study, meaning
      neither the patient nor the doctor will know which treatment is being assigned. Patients who
      respond well to the treatment will continue on the assigned treatment for an additional 4
      months. Patients will have regular follow-up visits to monitor their symptoms and any side
      effects they experience.

      This trial will determine the acute antidepressant efficacy of a standardized extract of
      hypericum (St. John's Wort) for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

      For this trial, the primary efficacy analysis will be evaluated at 8 weeks. For observational
      purposes, a 4-month double blind continuation (6 months total treatment) in treatment
      responders would enable an approximation of the effectiveness of maintenance treatment with
      this medication. No published studies have included a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) comparator. While this trial will not compare the efficacy of hypericum to an SSRI,
      having an SSRI arm of sertraline (Zoloft) will allow an evaluation of the validity of the
      trial.

      336 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with hypericum,
      sertraline, or placebo following a one-week placebo lead-in period (between screening and
      baseline). All treatment groups will consist of 112 patients and will be followed for an
      eight-week period. Treatment responders will be continued on the randomly assigned treatment
      arm for an additional 18 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Major depression assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
             (SCID; First et al, 1995)

          -  Minimum score greater than or equal to 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression (HAM-D)
             Scale at screen and at baseline

          -  GAF of 60 or less (moderate symptoms) at screen and at baseline

          -  HAM-D cannot decrease by 25% or more between screening and baseline

          -  Capacity to give informed consent and to follow study procedures.

          -  Abstinence or effective method of contraception throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:
