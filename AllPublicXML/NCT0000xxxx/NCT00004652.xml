      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the time period between randomization and endpoint is longer
      in the short term pimozide therapy or longer term therapy in patients with Tourette syndrome.

      II. Determine whether tic severity, medication side effects, academic performance and
      psychosocial functioning are better in the short term pimozide therapy or longer term
      pimozide therapy.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a combined open label and double blind randomized study.

      Patients receive pimozide (open label) orally until a stable level of tic control is achieved
      and remains unchanged for at least 1 month.

      Then, patients are randomized to one of two possible double blind treatments. In the short
      term pimozide group, patients receive pimozide over 2 weeks. Then, pimozide is gradually
      replaced by an inactive placebo within the following 10 weeks.

      Patients in the long term pimozide group receive pimozide. Patients continue treatment for 12
      months or until a worsening of tics or behavioral symptoms are present for which an increased
      dosage is required.

      Patients who do not experience an exacerbation of tics requiring an increase in dosage are
      followed for 1 year from the date of entry.
