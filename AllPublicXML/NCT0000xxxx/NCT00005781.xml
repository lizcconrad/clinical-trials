  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether digital photography is a reliable tool for diagnosing hand
      rashes, psoriasis and unusual moles. The findings will help determine if this method can be
      used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES), which monitors disease
      in the United States.

      Employees of the National Institutes of Health 19 years and older may enroll in this study.
      Participants will complete a brief questionnaire that includes information on skin type,
      history of skin conditions (moles, cancer, rashes, psoriasis), and demographic information
      such as name, age and sex. They will be examined by a dermatologist, who will note in writing
      the appearance of any hand rashes, unusual moles, or psoriasis. If any areas suspicious for
      skin cancer are found, the participant will receive this information in writing, along with
      advice about where to go for treatment.

      A total of six photographs will then be taken of the participant's arms, legs, hands and
      back. The face will not be photographed, and the participants will not be identifiable.

      This validation study is designed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, validity and
      reliability of digital photography of the skin as a prevalence assessment tool in preparation
      for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001 (NHANES IV). NHANES is charged
      with monitoring disease in the U.S. population, which is affected frequently by skin
      disorders and disease. The three skin disorders proposed for study in NHANES IV are atypical
      nevi, psoriasis, and hand dermatitis. This selection is based on the expected impact of these
      diseases on the U.S. population, including a prevalence of 3-10%, associated risk of melanoma
      in the case of atypical nevi, and associated disability in the cases of psoriasis and hand
      dermatitis.

      This skin disease section of NHANES, as currently planned for 2001, includes an imaging
      component with four standardized photographs to be obtained from each survey participant
      (SP). The selection of the regions to be photographed is designed to maximize the information
      obtained, while preserving patient privacy and is based on the known distribution of clinical
      findings of the three conditions, as well as NHANES logistical limitations. This validation
      study is a cooperative effort between the NIAMS extramural programs, the NCI intramural
      program, and the National Center for Health Statistics.

        Able to understand and sign consent.

        Patients who are wheelchair bound and are unable to have images of their back and lower
        extremities taken safely will be excluded from photography since this portion of the
        examination requires an ability to stand. However, they will still be eligible to
        participate in the skin cancer screening.
