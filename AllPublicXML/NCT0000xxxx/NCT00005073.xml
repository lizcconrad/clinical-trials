      RATIONALE: Zoledronate may be able to prevent bone metastases caused by prostate cancer. It
      is not yet known if zoledronate is effective in preventing the spread of prostate cancer to
      the bones.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of zoledronate plus
      standard therapy in preventing bone metastases in patients who have recurrent prostate cancer
      that is not causing symptoms.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the bone metastases free and overall survival in patients with
      asymptomatic recurrent prostate cancer treated with zoledronate vs placebo at different time
      points. II. Compare the time to first skeletal related events (pathological fractures,
      surgery to prevent or treat pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and radiotherapy
      to bone) and skeletal morbidity rate in patients treated with these 2 regimens. III. Assess
      quality of life and pain in these patients treated with these 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, open label, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified by prior local treatment (noncurative vs curative) and time
      interval between surgical castration or initiation of LHRH agonists and trial entry (less
      than 1 year vs 1-2 years vs greater than 2 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Arm II:
      Patients receive placebo IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Both arms: Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks in the absence of documented bone metastasis, disease progression, or unacceptable
      toxicity. All patients with documented bone metastases receive zoledronate as in arm I
      through year 4. All patients receive oral calcium and oral vitamin D daily. Patients who
      received LHRH agonists instead of surgical castration prior to study continue LHRH agonist
      therapy during study. Quality of life and pain are assessed before each treatment. Patients
      are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per arm) will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven asymptomatic recurrent prostate cancer Prior
        local treatment status Curatively treated OR Locally advanced disease noncuratively treated
        with LHRH agonist therapy Currently receiving 1 line of hormonal therapy (with LHRH
        agonists or surgical castration) and failing treatment with rising PSA only Patients who
        received LHRH agonists instead of surgical castration continue to receive LHRH agonist
        during study Biochemical progression documented by 3 consecutively rising PSA measurements,
        each at least 2 weeks apart, with the last measurement being 50% or greater than the nadir
        PSA achieved after the last therapeutic maneuver (first line hormonal therapy as noted
        above) PSA (50% increased values) greater than 4 ng/mL for patients with intact prostates
        and greater than 0.8 ng/mL for post-prostatectomy patients Rising PSA for less than 10
        months Castrate levels of testosterone (less than 30 ng/dL) No bone or visceral metastases
        by bone scan and CT scan of abdomen and pelvis (except localized abnormalities and pelvic
        lymph node and soft tissue disease) No CNS or leptomeningeal involvement

        Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Cardiovascular: No New York Heart Association
        class III or IV heart disease with uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac or coronary artery
        disease Other: No other malignancy within the past 5 years that would confound the etiology
        of metastatic disease except curatively treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer No other
        nonmalignant disease that would confound evaluation or preclude compliance Fertile patients
        must use effective contraception

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior systemic biologic anticancer therapy
        Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Concurrent chemotherapy such as estramustine containing
        regimens or mitoxantrone allowed at the discretion of the protocol investigator Endocrine
        therapy: See Disease Characteristics No prior systemic hormonal anticancer therapy except
        LHRH antagonists and/or nonsteroidal antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide, or
        nilutamide) Concurrent aminoglutethimide, prednisone, or diethylstilbestrol or other
        estrogens allowed at the discretion of the protocol investigator Radiotherapy: At least 6
        weeks since prior palliative radiotherapy Surgery: See Disease Characteristics Other: No
        other prior systemic anticancer therapy At least 4 weeks since other prior investigational
        drugs No other concurrent bisphosphonate agent
