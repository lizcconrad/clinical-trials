      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of WR 6026 in HIV-infected patients. To
      determine whether any unexpected toxicities are caused by WR 6026 in HIV-infected patients.
      To determine whether there is additional toxicity when WR 6026 is given for 21 days rather
      than 14 days. To further investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of WR 6026,
      and in particular to examine potential correlations between the area under the
      concentration-time curve and methemoglobinemia or other toxicities.

      In recent animal studies, WR 6026 demonstrated inhibitory activity against Pneumocystis
      carinii pneumonia (PCP). This study will assess the safety and tolerance of this drug in
      HIV-infected patients who do not have PCP.

      In recent animal studies, WR 6026 demonstrated inhibitory activity against Pneumocystis
      carinii pneumonia (PCP). This study will assess the safety and tolerance of this drug in
      HIV-infected patients who do not have PCP.

      Escalating doses of WR 6026 will be studied in successive patient cohorts. Four patients will
      be randomized to active drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio at each dose level until moderate
      toxicity is demonstrated. If one patient at a given dose level experiences WR 6026-related
      moderate or worse toxicity, the sample size for all subsequent dose levels will be doubled.
      If two or more patients at a given dose level experience moderate or dose-limiting toxicity,
      an additional four patients (randomized in the same 3:1 ratio) will be entered at that level,
      and sample size at all subsequent dose levels will be doubled. Dose escalation will continue
      until three of six patients receiving active drug at a given dose level experience
      dose-limiting or worse toxicity, or until two of six patients at a given dose level
      experience life-threatening toxicity. The MTD will be defined as the dose immediately below
      the highest dose studied. Eight additional patients will be studied at the presumed MTD to
      confirm tolerance.
