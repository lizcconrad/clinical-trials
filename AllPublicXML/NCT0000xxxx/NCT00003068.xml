      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose mitoxantrone, thiotepa, and
      cyclophosphamide plus autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation and amifostine in
      treating patients with primary, locally advanced, or stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide
      when administered in combination with thiotepa, autologous blood cells, and amifostine in
      patients with primary, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer, and determine whether
      amifostine, a cytoprotection agent, allows administration of high dose chemotherapy. II.
      Determine the dose limiting toxicities of this regimen when administered to patients with
      primary, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer. III. Evaluate the toxicities of
      amifostine, a cytoprotection agent, when administered in multiple doses to breast cancer
      patients receiving high dose chemotherapy and autologous blood cell transplantation. IV.
      Document the antitumor efficacy of this regimen versus freedom from recurrence and overall
      survival after autologous blood cell transplantation. V. Assess the contribution of disease,
      treatment, and personal characteristics affecting the quality of life in these patients and
      the patient's primary caregiver.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Autologous blood cells are collected after
      completion of neoadjuvant/induction chemotherapy (and salvage mastectomy, if indicated).
      Patients receive IV amifostine, mitoxantrone, and thiotepa on day -7. On day -6, patients
      receive IV amifostine, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide treatment. On days -5, -4, and -3, IV
      amifostine and cyclophosphamide are administered to participants. Following high dose
      chemotherapy treatment, patients rest on days -2 and -1. On day 0, patients undergo
      autologous blood cell transplantation. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of
      mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. If 1 of 3 patients at a given dose level experiences dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT), an additional 3 patients are treated at that dose. If at least 3 of
      6 patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then the maximum tolerated dose is the
      previous dose level. Patients are followed at day 100, then every 6 months for 2 years, then
      annually until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven primary, locally advanced (at least 10
        axillary lymph node metastases or T4 or N2, M0 disease), or stage IV breast cancer Patients
        with at least 10 axillary node metastases and no distant metastases receive adjuvant
        chemotherapy with a doxorubicin containing regimen Patients with T4 or N2, M0 disease and
        no prior chemotherapy receive neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy prior to salvage
        mastectomy (patients must show partial remission based on tumor palpation) Patients with
        stage IV breast cancer receive induction chemotherapy with doxorubicin (unless relapsed
        less than 1 year following therapy or metastatic disease progression observed or greater
        than 300 mg/m2 previously taken, then may receive induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel
        regimen) Stage IV cancer patients must have at least a partial remission following
        induction chemotherapy Stage IV cancer patients should have minimal metastatic disease
        (chest wall recurrence or bone only); patients with more extensive and/or visceral
        metastases must have near complete remission following induction chemotherapy
