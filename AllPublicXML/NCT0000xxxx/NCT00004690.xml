      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of monolaurin cream versus a placebo vehicle
      cream in suppressing the signs of nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma.

      II. Assess the incidence of posttreatment rebound or recrudescence in patients with
      congenital ichthyosis.

      III. Evaluate the long term safety of monolaurin cream with whole body application in these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a three month, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study
      followed by a nine month, open label, rollover study.

      Patients are treated either with a placebo vehicle cream or the study cream, monolaurin (15%
      glyceryl monolaurate), for 3 months followed by a four week break. Medications are applied
      uniformly twice daily (morning and at least 1 hour before bedtime). After this blinded
      portion of the study, all patients are administered monolaurin cream for 9 months.

      Patients are followed for 4 weeks after the last cream application.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

          -  Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (chronic, multifactorial,
             hyperkeratotic, inflammatory skin disease) Clinical criteria includes: - generalized
             involvement with no flexural sparing - congenital onset usually as collodion baby
             (i.e., a taut, shiny encasement which is shed postnatally revealing underlying
             erythroderma and generalized ichthyosis) - scales should be fine, whitish, and rather
             loose except on the lower legs where the scales may be large, platelike, and dark - if
             severely effected: intense erythema is present; overt ectropion may be present;
             cicatricial alopecia may be present; and secondary nail dystrophies with thickening of
             nail plate and ridging may be present

          -  Phenotypically consistent with diagnostic grading photos

          -  Grade of at least 3 for scaling on four treatment sites

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

          -  Biologic therapy: Not specified

          -  Chemotherapy: Not specified

          -  Endocrine therapy: At least 4 weeks since prior corticosteroids No concurrent
             corticosteroids

          -  Radiotherapy: Not specified

          -  Surgery: Not specified

          -  Other: At least 4 weeks since any prior investigational medications At least 4 weeks
             since any prior systemic therapy, such as hypolipidemics or retinoids Nonglycerin
             emollients allowed up to 1 week prior to study At least 4 weeks since any other
             topical therapy including humectants such as urea, alpha hydroxy or alpha ketoacid
             preparations and retinoids No concurrent topical therapy No concurrent investigational
             medications

        --Patient Characteristics--

          -  Age: 18 months and over

          -  Performance status: Not specified

          -  Hematopoietic: No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities

          -  Hepatic: No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities

          -  Renal: No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities

          -  Other: Triglyceride or total cholesterol no greater than 3 times normal Must be in
             general good health No known hypersensitivity to any component of this study
