      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety, tolerance, and maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous
           interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

        -  Evaluate the hematologic effects of subcutaneous IL-2 in MDS.

      OUTLINE: IL-2 will be administered in cycles of twice daily subcutaneous injections 7 days a
      week for 4 consecutive weeks. After each cycle the patient will be evaluated for response.
      The patient could continue IL-2 therapy for up to 12 cycles. There are 4 dose levels of IL-2.
      At each dose level 3 patients will be accrued sequentially.

      Treatment with IL-2 should be continued until grade III toxicity or any side effects
      requiring hospitalization occurs. After the patient returns to baseline pretherapy values or
      grade I toxicity, the subject will resume IL-2 at 50% of the initial dose. If the patient
      again goes into grade III toxicity or is in need of hospitalization, IL-2 will be
      discontinued.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Between 12-24 patients will be accrued.
