      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. SU5416 may stop the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood flow
      to the tumor. Combining more than once chemotherapy drug with SU5416 may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 combined with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of SU5416 when combined with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the antitumor
      activity of this combination treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive gemcitabine
      IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1; SU5416 IV over 70 minutes
      on day 4; gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by SU5416 IV over 70 minutes on day 8, and
      SU5416 on days 11, 15, and 18. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following 6 courses of therapy,
      patients with stable and responsive disease may receive SU5416 alone on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15,
      and 18 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 1 year. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which at least one third of the patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, and then every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
