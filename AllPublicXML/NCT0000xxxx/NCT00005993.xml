      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.
      Filgrastim and stem cell factor may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow
      or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of
      cancer therapy. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that
      were destroyed by therapy used to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 and stem cell factor
      following peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, or advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
      stem cell factor (SCF) following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or advanced breast cancer. II. Determine the
      effectiveness of filgrastim (G-CSF) and SCF as mobilizing agents in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of stem cell factor (SCF). Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) followed by SCF SC daily for 7-10 days. Beginning on
      the fifth day of G-CSF and SCF injections, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected
      over several days. PBSC are later reinfused and patients receive G-CSF SC daily until
      hematopoietic recovery. At least 30 days but no later than 110 days following transplant,
      patients who did not experience adverse reactions to SCF during mobilization begin
      posttransplant immunotherapy. Patients receive interleukin-2 SC daily and SCF SC 3 times
      weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCF during posttransplant
      immunotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.
      Patients are followed at 1 week, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
