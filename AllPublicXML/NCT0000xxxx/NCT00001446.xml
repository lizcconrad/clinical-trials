      This is a phase II study designed to evaluate the potential clinical efficacy of thalidomide
      in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

      An important aspect of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide, as
      well as make correlations between the degree of angiogenesis occurring in a patient and the
      activity of thalidomide.

      This is a phase II study designed to evaluate the potential clinical efficacy of thalidomide
      in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Patients will be randomized to two
      different treatment arms (low dose versus high dose). An important aspect of this study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide, as well as make correlations between the
      degree of angiogenesis occurring in a patient and the activity of thalidomide. Each patient
      that has biopsiable lesions will undergo a pretreatment biopsy of their prostate (or other
      site of soft tissue disease) and repeat after 2 to 6 months of treatment. Additional
      information will be obtained on the changes in the circulating levels of the following growth
      factors: bFGF, TNF, VEGF, and TGFB. Neurological complications are the primary dose-limiting
      toxicity anticipated with chronic thalidomide administration.

        Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Confirmation by the Clinical
        Center Pathology Department required.

        CT-defined soft tissue disease required for staging if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less
        than 20 ng/mL.

        Progressive hormone-refractory disease for 1 month prior to entry (and after withdrawal of
        any antiandrogens), documented by at least one of the following: 3 consecutive rising
        levels of PSA at least 1 week apart. 1 measurement at least 50% greater than PSA nadir
        after last therapy.

        New bone metastasis on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy.

        Progression of measurable or evaluable soft-tissue metastases.
