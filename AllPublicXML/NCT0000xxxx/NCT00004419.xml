      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and toxic effects of recombinant human insulin-like
      growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on carbohydrate tolerance, insulin action, insulin secretion,
      hyperandrogenism, and hyperlipidemia in patients with severe insulin resistance who have
      failed other therapies.

      II. Determine the dose and time response of rhIGF-I on carbohydrate homeostasis and secondary
      abnormalities in this patient population.

      III. Determine the effect of rhIGF-I on insulin clearance, the regulation of insulin-like
      growth factor binding protein 1, the regulation of sex hormone binding globulin, and
      hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis in this patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive the first dose of
      subcutaneous recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on day 7.

      Patients receive rhIGF-I twice daily 15-30 minutes before breakfast and dinner, and are
      hospitalized for the first week of therapy. Patients return for an outpatient exam on day 19
      of rhIGF-I therapy. Approximately 30 days into the therapy, patients are readmitted to the
      clinical center for repeat screening tests. Patients then receive maintenance therapy of
      rhIGF-I for up to 6-12 months. A washout period follows the maintenance therapy phase.

      Patients are followed weekly, biweekly, or monthly depending on blood glucose response of
      patients off rhIGF-I therapy. Weekly phone contact with study coordinator is mandatory during
      this time.
