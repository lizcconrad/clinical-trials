      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with irinotecan
      works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity and toxicities of irinotecan and paclitaxel in patients
           with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by irinotecan IV
      over 30 minutes. Treatment continues weekly for 2 weeks followed by one week of rest. Courses
      are repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
