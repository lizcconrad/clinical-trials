  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To ascertain whether the origin of plasma HIV-1-RNA following T cell activation represents
      the activation of latently infected cells or an increase in cells permissive for replacing
      viral mutants.

      The mechanism by which immune stimulation increases circulating levels of HIV-1 is not known.
      In particular, it is uncertain whether the transient increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA is due to
      enhanced replication of an actively replicating pool of HIV-1, or is due instead to
      activation of proviral sequences in previously resting CD4+ cells. One approach to
      discriminate these alternatives is a &quot;molecular pulse-chase&quot; experiment. In this approach,
      drug resistant mutants would be selected by administration of Lamivudine (3TC).

      Twenty subjects without prior 3TC experience will be treated with 3TC for 2 weeks. On day 14,
      half of the subjects will receive immunization with both the influenza and pneumococcal
      vaccine. 3TC will be discontinued at this time. Patients will be followed for 4 weeks after
      the immunization.
