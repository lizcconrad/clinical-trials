  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to identify and clone the gene(s) responsible for the Alagille
      Syndrome (AGS) by a positional cloning approach. The first step towards this goal is to
      define the smallest genomic candidate region for AGS at 20p12 and to begin to identify genes
      within this region which are, by definition, candidate genes for the disease. In a
      collaborative effort with clinician-investigators studying the Alagille syndrome, metaphase
      chromosomes and genomic DNA from affected individuals will be studied for subchromosomal
      deletions and for mutations in the candidate genes. Characterization of genes involved in
      Alagille syndrome could provide important insight into the pathophysiology of the disease,
      the development of normal liver and treatment of this disease. Recently, we and others found
      that mutations in Jagged1, a Notch1 receptor are responsible for Alagille Syndrome.

        All enrolled affected subjects, whose samples will be analyzed in this study, must meet the
        criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alagille Syndrome (Syndromic Bile Duct Paucity)
        which include liver biopsy findings consistent with Alagille Syndrome and at least 3 of the
        5 primary clinical criteria: cholestasis, characteristic face, posterior embryotoxon,
        &quot;butterfly&quot; vertebrae and cardiac findings.
