      BACKGROUND:

      The Strong Heart Study is a longitudinal cohort study of several American Indian groups in
      three participating centers. The overall aim of the main study is to determine the role of
      various risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease in this native American
      population.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data from the first and second clinical exams of the Strong Heart Study were analyzed to
      determine if body fat distribution as measured by waist-to-hip circumference was a better
      correlate of lipoproteins than was body mass index. In addition, change in body mass index
      (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were correlated with change in lipoproteins.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
