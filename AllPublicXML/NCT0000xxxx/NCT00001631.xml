  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flows to areas of the heart providing oxygen and fuel to the pumping muscle.
      Occasionally the arteries providing the fuel can become blocked. This occurs in coronary
      artery disease.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate the blood flow to different areas of
      the heart muscle. In this study magnetic resonance imaging will be compared to other
      diagnostic tests (radionucleotide perfusion studies) capable of measuring blood flow to heart
      muscle.

    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of myocardial enhancement during first
      passage of intravenously injected gadolinium contrast will be used to evaluate regional
      myocardial perfusion in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The MRI results will be compared with conventional radionuclide
      perfusion studies (ex. dipyridamole thallium). A clinically defined normal group will also be
      studied without radionuclide correlation.
