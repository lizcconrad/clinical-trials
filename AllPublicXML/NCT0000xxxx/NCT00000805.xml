      PRIMARY: To determine the pharmacokinetics, MTD, and long-term safety and tolerance of oral
      ganciclovir in HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate the effect of oral ganciclovir on the virologic parameters of CMV.

      Maintenance treatment with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS
      patients is now standard therapy, but daily IV therapy can be complicated by catheter
      infections and thrombosis. An oral regimen of ganciclovir has been administered safely in
      adult AIDS patients and may be of significant benefit to children and infants as well.

      infections and thrombosis. An oral regimen of ganciclovir has been administered safely in

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 5 (PER AMENDMENT 10/24/95, was 4) oral (syrup or capsules) dose
      levels following a single intravenous dose of ganciclovir. Treatment continues for 72 (PER
      AMENDMENT 10/24/95, was 24 weeks) weeks after the last patient has been enrolled.
