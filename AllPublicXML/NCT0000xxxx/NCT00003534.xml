  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer provide very limited benefit to the
      patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove
      beneficial in the treatment of Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer patients receive gradually escalating doses of
      intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose
      is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory Stage IV
           Prostate Cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response,
           partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients With Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
