  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of topical cidofovir (HPMPC) therapy for refractory
      mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus disease in AIDS patients. To determine whether topical
      HPMPC therapy can induce re-epithelialization and healing of refractory mucocutaneous herpes
      simplex virus disease in AIDS patients. To evaluate the virologic effects of topical HPMPC
      therapy on herpes simplex virus shedding from refractory lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive topical therapy with placebo (vehicle alone) or HPMPC at
      either 0.3 or 1.0 percent once daily for 5 days. Patients are assessed to day 15; those with
      no significant toxicity are eligible to receive open-label topical HPMPC for up to 6 months.
