      The purpose of this study is to see if a behavioral intervention, a special kind of
      counseling, can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. The behavioral
      intervention will be compared to the standard risk reduction counseling that is given before
      and after getting an HIV test.

      In standard pre- and post-test counseling, everyone is told the same things about how to
      prevent HIV. The behavioral intervention used in this study is designed to help each
      individual prevent HIV according to his specific problems and needs.

      The intervention being evaluated in this trial is based on the extensive literature on
      behavioral approaches to risk reduction in MSM. These reviews recommend an intervention that,
      unlike the current standard HIV pre-test and post-test risk-reduction counseling, is tailored
      to an individual's unique problems and needs, lifestyle, and situations that contribute to
      high-risk behavior. Furthermore, there is a need for HIV-prevention intervention trials using
      biological endpoints (e.g., HIV seroconversion) in addition to behavioral change indices.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the behavioral intervention or the
      control risk-reduction counseling. The same counseling staff provides the two types of
      treatment. The behavioral intervention consists of 10 counseling sessions within a 4-month
      period followed by quarterly maintenance sessions for the remainder of the 3-year follow-up.
      The intervention is conducted on a one-to-one basis and targets condom use, change in sexual
      practices associated with HIV risk, and change in sexual practices in the context of alcohol
      and drug use. Participants in the control group receive pre- and post-test counseling at
      enrollment, then semiannually through Month 36. Beginning at Month 6, all participants
      complete routine semiannual visits. At each visit, Risk Assessment and phlebotomy for
      specimen collection for HIV antibody tests are administered. As is routine in most public
      counseling and testing venues, participants in the control condition do not see the same
      counselor consistently.
