      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the incidence of neuroendocrine dysfunction in patients with closed head
      injuries admitted to the Transitional Learning Community in Galveston, Texas, for
      rehabilitation.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Phase I: Patients undergo fasting for urine and blood endocrine
      assessments. First morning urine is collected for measurement of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin
      (6-SMT). Following a medical history and a physical examination, patients undergo measurement
      of serum levels of free thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, insulin-like
      growth factor I (IGF-I), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), free and total testosterone
      (males only), and baseline growth hormone (GH). Female patients also provide a menstrual
      history and undergo screening for hypogonadism. Patients then undergo GH stimulation testing
      comprised of measurement of serum GH levels before and on 6 occasions during the 3 hours
      after receiving glucagon IV.

      After eating, patients undergo adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing comprised of
      measurement of serum cortisol levels before and at 45 minutes after receiving corticotropin
      IV.

      Phase II: Beginning at noon on a different day, patients with any abnormal endocrine tests
      during phase I undergo 24 hour inpatient dynamic testing of the neuroendocrine system.
      Patients undergo GH stimulation testing comprised of measurement of serum GH levels before
      and on 4 occasions during the 2 hours after receiving levodopa. Patients also undergo
      concurrent thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
      stimulation testing comprised of measurement of serum TSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels
      before and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after receiving TRH and GnRH IV. Patients then
      undergo overnight metyrapone testing comprised of baseline measurement of serum
      11-deoxycortisol and cortisol levels, followed by oral metyrapone with a snack, overnight
      fasting, and then remeasurement of serum 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol levels.
