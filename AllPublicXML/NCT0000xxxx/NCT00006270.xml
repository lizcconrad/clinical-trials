      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the randomness of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol
      secretion using approximate entropy in patients who have sustained a head injury.

      II. Determine the correlation between randomness of ACTH and cortisol secretion and stages of
      sleep in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of injury (closed head injury due
      to trauma vs vascular accidents). Patients are admitted two times for overnight assessment.

      Admission 1: Patients receive cosyntropin IV. Blood is drawn at 30 and 60 minutes after IV
      infusion. Patients receive oral metyrapone before sleep. A sham sleep study is conducted
      through the night and patients' blood is drawn in the morning.

      Admission 2: At least 2 weeks after admission 1, patients return for an overnight admission.
      Starting in the evening, blood is drawn every 15 minutes for 12 hours. A sleep study is
      conducted through the night.
