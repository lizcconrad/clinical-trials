    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give combinations of three
      or four anti-HIV drugs to HIV-infected patients. The drugs used in this study are delavirdine
      (DLV), nelfinavir (NLF), didanosine (ddI), and stavudine (d4T).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study. Patients are stratified by HIV-1 RNA levels (20,000
      to 200,000 copies/ml and greater than 200,000 copies/ml). Patients are equally randomized to
      one of four groups and receive antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks. Group 1 receives
      delavirdine (DLV) plus nelfinavir (NFV) plus stavudine (d4T). Group 2 receives DLV plus NFV
      plus didanosine (ddI). Group 3 receives NFV plus d4T plus ddI. Group 4 receives DLV plus NFV
      plus d4T plus ddI. Patients are evaluated for drug safety and viral burden. Patients may opt
      to continue on the study for 24 additional weeks, at the discretion of the investigator.
