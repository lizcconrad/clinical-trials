      The objective of this study is to determine if the action of the drug called clopidogrel,
      that you will start taking, will be decreased by another drug called atorvastatin, that you
      will also start taking. Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet agent that has been shown to
      prevent strokes and heart attacks. Atorvastatin is a cholesterol lowering agent.

      Twenty adults 18-75 years of age requiring cholesterol-lowering agent and antiplatelet agent
      therapy will be recruited for this study during their cardiology clinic visitation. In one
      group, antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel) regimen will be administered first, then followed by
      cholesterol-lowering medication (atorvastatin). In the second group, atorvastatin will be
      administered first, followed by clopidogrel.

      A new test called the erythromycin breath test will be administered to you three times during
      the study to measure how your liver will metabolize these drugs. Blood samples will also be
      obtained to assess platelet function. The criteria for exclusion are patient refusal or
      inability to give written consent, patients with allergic reaction to erythromycin, patients
      with known bleeding problems, liver disease, significant lung disease kidney disease and
      pregnancy. Patients with psychiatric impairment and documented history of substance abuse
      will also be excluded from the study.
