      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of low doses of
      cyclosporine (CsA) in patients with early HIV infection and to evaluate its effect on the
      immune system.

      Activation of T cells (cells of the immune system) leads to HIV replication. Inhibition of
      immune activation is therefore a potentially important area of therapy for patients with
      early HIV infection. CsA is capable of decreasing T cell activation, which in turn may
      decrease HIV replication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing data on the potential for inhibition of immune activation as primary
      therapy for HIV infection. The rationale of CsA therapy is to decrease T cell activation in
      patients with early HIV infection. Activation of T cells leads to translation and
      transcription of provirus, release of viral progeny, and ultimately cell death. T cell
      activation also leads to increased cell death via apoptosis. CsA is capable of inhibiting
      both these events and thus may lead to decreased CD4 cell turnover.

      This study has 2 arms of 15 patients each. Patients in Arm I receive placebo. Patients in Arm
      II receive CsA. Each arm is further divided into 2 strata. Stratum 1 patients are not allowed
      to receive antiretroviral therapy. Stratum 2 patients must receive 1 of the following 4
      stable nucleoside analogue combinations:

        1. Zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC)

        2. ZDV plus didanosine (ddI)

        3. Stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC

        4. d4T plus ddI.
