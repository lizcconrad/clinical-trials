    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic
      or locally recurrent colorectal cancer. SU5416 may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by
      stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate and disease stabilization rates of patients with
      previously treated metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer treated with SU5416.

      II. Determine the median and overall survival and time to progression in this patient
      population receiving this treatment.

      III. Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patient receive SU5416 IV over 60 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues for a
      minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
