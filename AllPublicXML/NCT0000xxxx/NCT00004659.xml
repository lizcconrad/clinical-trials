      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether stereotactic radiosurgery provides local control at multiple
      sites in patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors, controlled systemic disease, and
      preserved neurologic function.

      II. Examine survival, clinical outcome, and local tumor imaging response in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Tumor size and number are confirmed prior to
      randomization. Patients are stratified by participating institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. One group is treated with
      fractionated whole-brain irradiation using megavoltage equipment.

      The second group receives stereotactic radiosurgery plus fractionated whole-brain
      radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery involves irradiation of all tumors to the margins on
      stereotactic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Either treatment may be
      administered first; the second treatment begins within 1 month of the first.

      Concurrent anticonvulsants and steroids are allowed. Patients are followed for change in size
      and number of tumors at 1, 3, and 6 months; follow-up clinical exams are performed at least
      every 2 months.
