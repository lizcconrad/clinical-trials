      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different
      combinations may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II double-blinded trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel
      and carboplatin given with either amifostine or placebo in patients with metastatic stage III
      or stage IV ovarian cancer or metastatic stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether patients with metastatic ovarian and non-small cell lung
      cancer receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel have significantly fewer neuropathic events when
      treated with amifostine.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel group, double blind, controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to either the amifostine or control group. All patients receive intravenous
      paclitaxel over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients
      who are randomized to the amifostine group receive intravenous amifostine administered as a
      15 minute infusion 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel therapy. Patients randomized to the control
      group receive an intravenous placebo solution. Patients are discontinued from the study if
      they have disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects after 2 cycles of treatment.
      Patients are followed monthly for 8 months post treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued (40 with advanced ovarian cancer
      and 40 with advanced non-small cell lung cancer) within 2 years.
