      Prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately 334,500 men each year and accounts for nearly
      41,800 deaths in the United States. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans
      and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and,
      particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain
      obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while hormones are also important
      in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the
      1940?s, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced
      disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither epidemiologic studies nor basic
      sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However, recent
      observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine
      expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic
      role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus, it is important to attempt to identify
      genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary screening and counseling efforts.

      Primary Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between the length of the CAG repeat
      sequence occurring in the androgen receptor gene and major prostate cancer prognostic
      determinants (race, age, histologic grade and stage) at the time of diagnosis in black and
      white veterans.

      Secondary Objectives: To create a secure, organized bank of DNA plasma samples obtained from
      newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and assay the peripheral blood DNA for inherited
      polymorphisms of the androgen receptor gene.

      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are androgen receptor CAG repeat sequence length and
      stage of disease.

      Intervention: N/A

      Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately 334,500 men each year and
      accounts for nearly 41,800 deaths in the United States. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer
      affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate
      cancer and, particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in
      African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while
      hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins
      recognized this effect in the 1940's, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone
      of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither
      epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role
      of hormones. However, recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and
      their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important
      clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus, it is
      important to attempt to identify genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary
      screening and counseling efforts.

      It has been recently demonstrated that the androgen receptor functions as a ligand-dependent
      transcriptional regulator, and that this regulation is important in controlling prostate
      growth and apoptosis. Heightened androgenic stimulation, a potential by-product of shortened
      CAG repeat length, could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer development and
      progression. In particular, a shorter CAG repeat sequence may be associated with cancers that
      have features of higher histologic grade, extraprostatic extension, and distant metastases
      (stage C or D). Recent evidence indicates that men with shorter CAG repeats are at
      particularly higher risk for distant metastatic and fatal prostate cancer. The results
      demonstrated that a shorter CAG repeat sequence in the androgen receptor gene predicted
      higher grade and advanced state of prostate cancer at diagnosis, metastatic disease, and
      mortality. However, these studies have been limited to whites since only a small number of
      African American men with prostate cancer were included.

      Prostate cancer incidence varies between African-American and white men. African-American men
      have the highest known incidence rates in the world, 66% higher than white men in the U.S.
      The genetic findings described above raise the possibility that racial differences in the
      distribution of androgen receptor polymorphisms may account for the higher rate of prostate
      cancer, the more advanced disease, and the younger age at presentation in African-Americans.

      This study created a cohort of prostate cancer patients who are well characterized with
      respect to histology, stage of diagnosis, and (over time) mortality. This study is generating
      data regarding the length of the CAG repeat sequence occurring in the androgen receptor gene
      and major prostate cancer prognostic determinants (histologic grade and state) at the time of
      diagnosis in black and white veterans. CAG repeat lengths on the androgen receptor gene were
      evaluated for a cohort of 145 African American and 150 white veterans with prostate cancer.

      Results: Mean androgen receptor gene CAG repeat lengths for Caucasians was 21.9 versus 19.8
      for African Americans, p=0.0001. However, a truncated CAG repeat length (CAG &lt;= 18 versus CAG
      &gt; 18) was not associated with advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis, higher PSA at diagnosis,
      or higher Gleason score (each with p&gt;0.5).

      Conclusion: The mean androgen receptor CAG repeat length was 2 repeats shorter for African
      American versus white prostate cancer patients. These findings raise concern that prostate
      cancers in African American men may be less sensitive to hormonal therapy than those in white
      men. These findings provide biologic rationale for clinical trials that evaluate the joint
      administration of chemotherapy and hormone therapy for African American men with advanced
      prostate cancer.
