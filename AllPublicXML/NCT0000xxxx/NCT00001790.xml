  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of
      FK463, a novel echinocandin (cell wall-active antifungal lipopeptide), as early empirical
      therapy for prevention of fungal infections in immunocompromised children. The study is
      designed as a multicenter open label, sequential dose escalation study of intravenous FK463.
      Intravenous FK463 will be administered daily as an hour infusion to patients with new onset
      of fever and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 500/mm3) who will
      be initiated onto broad spectrum empirical antibacterial therapy. The patient population
      consists of children ages 2 to 17 years of age; two age cohorts will be studied (2-12,
      13-17). Dosage levels will be 0.5mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day), 1.0 mg/kg/day (not to
      exceed 50 mg/day), 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day) and 2.0mg/kg/day (not to exceed
      100mg/day). The planned sample size is 64 patients (a maximum of two replacement patients may
      be added to a given dose level and age cohort, for a total of no more than 10 patients per
      dose level and age cohort. The study will enroll no more than 80 patients). At each dosage
      level, a total of 8 patients will be enrolled into each age cohort (2-12, 13-17); a total of
      16 patients will be enrolled into each dosage level. The first group of patients will receive
      FK463 at 0.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day). The second group of patients will receive
      1.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 50mg/day). The third group of patients will receive 1.5
      mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day). The fourth group of patients will receive 2.0mg/kg/day
      (not to exceed 100mg/day). Study drug will continue until recovery from neutropenia (ANC post
      nadir greater than or equal 250/mm3) or until the initiation of conventional deoxycholate
      amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy or
      for proven fungal infection. Patients may receive FK463 for a maximum duration of 14 days.
      For any patient who meets institutional criteria to start standard empirical antifungal
      therapy with conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin
      B (greater than 96 hours on study drug) or who has a proven breakthrough fungal infection,
      FK463 will be discontinued and conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid
      formulation of amphotericin B will be initiated.

      FK463, a novel echinocandin (cell wall-active antifungal lipopeptide), as early empirical
      therapy for prevention of fungal infections in immunocompromised children. The study is
      designed as a multicenter open label, sequential dose escalation study of intravenous FK463.
      Intravenous FK463 will be administered daily as a one hour infusion to patients with new
      onset of fever and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 500/mm3) who
      will be initiated onto broad spectrum empirical antibacterial therapy. The patient population
      consists of children ages 2 to 17 years of age; two age cohorts will be studied (2-12,
      13-17). Dosage levels will be 0.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day), 1.0 mg/kg/day (not to
      exceed 50 mg/day), 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day). 2.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 100
      mg/day), 3.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 150 mg/day) and 4.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 200
      mg/day). The planned sample size is 96 patients (a maximum of two replacement patients may be
      added to a given dose level and age cohort, for a total of no more than 10 patients per dose
      level and age cohort. The study will enroll no more than 120 patients). At each dosage level,
      a total of 8 patients will be enrolled into each age cohort (2-12, 13-17); a total of 16
      patients will be enrolled at each dosage level. The first group of patients will receive
      FK463 at 0.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 25 mg/day). The second group of patients will receive
      1.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 50 mg/day). The third group of patients will receive 1.5
      mg/kg/day (not to exceed 75 mg/day). The fourth group of patients will receive 2.0 mg/kg/day
      (not to exceed 100 mg/day). The fifth group of patients will receive 3.0 mg/kg/day (not to
      exceed 150 mg/day). The sixth group of patients will receive 4.0 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 200
      mg/day). Study drug will continue until recovery from neutropenia (ANC post nadir greater
      than or equal 250/mm3) or until the initiation of conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or
      a lipid formulation of amphotericin B for empirical antifungal therapy or for proven fungal
      infection. Patients may receive FK463 for a maximum duration of 14 days. For any patient who
      meets institutional criteria to start standard empirical antifungal therapy with conventional
      deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (greater than 96 hours
      on study drug) or who has a proven breakthrough fungal infection, FK463 will be discontinued
      and conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B will be
      initiated.
