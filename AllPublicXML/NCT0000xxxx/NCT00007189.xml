  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test the ability of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      medications naproxen and celecoxib to delay or prevent the onset of AD and age-related
      cognitive decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable evidence suggests that inflammation may play a role in the neurodegenerative
      process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may
      be associated with reduced occurrence of AD. ADAPT is a randomized trial that will test the
      ability of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications naproxen and celecoxib to delay or
      prevent the onset of AD and age-related cognitive decline. This long-term trial will run for
      5 to 7 years.

      The study is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and is being conducted at the
      Roskamp Institute in Tampa, FL; the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System with the
      University of Washington, in Seattle, WA; Boston University School of Medicine, in Boston,
      MA; the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, in Baltimore, MD; Sun Health Research Institute,
      in Phoenix, AZ; and the University of Rochester, in Rochester, NY. At each of these six
      sites, the goal is the enroll approximately 700 men and women, totalling 2,625 participants.
      Participants must be 70 years of age or older, have a parent, brother, or sister who has, or
      had, serious age-related memory loss, senility, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease.

      Participants will be asked to take an anti-inflammatory medication or placebo (inactive pill)
      twice daily. Before enrolling in the trial, participants will be asked to go to a study site
      for two medical evaluations. Once enrolled, they will need to go to a study site for a
      medical evaluation every six months and to participate in a telephone interview twice a year
      for an average of up to seven years of follow-up.
