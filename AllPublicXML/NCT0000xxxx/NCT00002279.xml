      AMENDED: To provide ddC for patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have failed treatment
      with, are intolerant to or are ineligible to receive zidovudine (AZT) and to demonstrate that
      ddC monotherapy is safe, and tolerable in this patient population.

      Original design: To provide zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) for patients with AIDS or
      advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC) who have failed treatment with or are intolerant to
      zidovudine (AZT) and who are also intolerant to dideoxyinosine (ddI); to demonstrate that ddC
      monotherapy is safe and tolerable in the treatment of patients who previously experienced
      either treatment failure, hematologic intolerance or myositis with AZT treatment and
      pancreatitis or other toxicities (except peripheral neuropathy with ddI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first 50 patients enrolled into the study will be with investigators having prior ddC
      experience, specifically AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), or non-ACTG investigators who are
      listed in ddC protocols NIAID ACTG 012, 112, 047, 050, 106 (N3447), 114 (N3300), 119 (N3492),
      N3226, or investigators at any ACTG center or ACTG satellite centers with knowledge of ddC
      therapy.

      Once all 50 patients have been entered and 25 have completed four weeks of treatment the
      study will be dependent upon receipt of completed case forms up to week #4 of treatment for
      the 25 patients who have been reviewed and evaluated for safety.

      Patients 51-200 may then be entered by any physician licensed in his or her state who has
      experience with AIDS patients and agrees to follow the patients as specified in the protocol.
      After all 200 have been entered and week #16 case report forms are returned to the ddC
      Coordinating Center and reviewed for safety for 100 of the 200 patients, the protocol would
      be open without limit on numbers of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Recommended:

          -  Aerosolized Pentamidine or other prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
             (PCP).

          -  Allowed:

          -  Drugs or treatments that could cause other serious additive toxicity when
             coadministered with study medication will be allowed for treatment of an acute
             intercurrent illness or opportunistic infection at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Isoniazid, if there is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy at entry and the patient
             is taking pyridoxine = or &gt; 50 mg/day.

          -  Metronidazole, only with a study drug interruption; neurological exam should be
             performed before and after treatment with metronidazole and ddC restarted only if
             there are no signs, symptoms or neurological findings suggestive of peripheral
             neuropathy.

          -  It is recommended that patients requiring amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine,
             intravenous trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, ganciclovir, intravenous pentamidine,
             intravenous acyclovir or acyclovir = or &gt; 1000 mg/day orally or other bone marrow or
             renal toxic drugs have an interruption of ddC until they are stable for two weeks on a
             maintenance dose of the above medications and only then can ddC be restarted.

          -  Patients on amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim /
             sulfamethoxazole, ganciclovir, intravenous acyclovir or acyclovir = or &gt; 1000 mg/day
             orally or other bone marrow or renal toxic drugs may not tolerate concomitant ddC.

          -  If these drugs are given concomitantly with ddC, patients should have frequent
             (weekly) laboratory assessments, as appropriate.

          -  Drugs that are nephrotoxic or have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy might
             be expected to cause increased toxicity when co-administered with ddC.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Radiation therapy with dideoxycytidine (ddC) interruption until stable for 2 weeks on
             treatment.

          -  Treatment categories are now:

          -  AZT treatment failure. AZT intolerance. AZT ineligibility

        Original design:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and fall into one
             of the following 2 categories:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) treatment failure and dideoxyinosine (ddI) intolerance or AZT
             intolerance and ddI intolerance. Under 18 years of age must have the consent of a

             was not the reason for discontinuation of other anti-HIV therapy.

          -  Any finding suggestive of peripheral neuropathy found at neurological exam. If patient
             has an isolated finding of an absent achilles reflex he may be entered if no signs or
             symptoms and no other findings are suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Neoplasms other than Kaposi's sarcoma or basal cell carcinoma.
