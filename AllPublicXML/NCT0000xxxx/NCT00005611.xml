      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-188797 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose, dose
      limiting toxicities, and safety of BMS-188787 in patients with nonhematologic malignancies.
      II. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-188797 in these patients. III. Describe any
      antitumor activity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour.
      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until
      toxicities resolve, and then at the investigator's discretion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonhematologic
        malignancy unresponsive to existing therapy or for which no curative therapy exists
        Patients with prostate cancer must have withdrawn from antiandrogen therapy (flutamide,
        bicalutamide) for at least 4 weeks and must have progressive disease Measurable or
        evaluable disease No active brain metastases (e.g., cerebral edema, progression from prior
        imaging study, requirement for steroids, or clinical symptoms)

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At

        at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL ALT and AST no greater
        than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless due to hepatic metastases) Renal:
        Creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN Other: No serious uncontrolled medical disorder or
        active infection that would preclude study No hypersensitivity to agents containing
        polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) except in patients who received prior taxane
        therapy with premedication and did not experience greater than grade 1 hypersensitivity
        reaction Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use
        effective contraception

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 4 weeks since prior immunotherapy
        Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks since prior nitrosoureas,
        mitomycin, or carboplatin) Prior taxanes allowed No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine
        therapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 2 weeks since prior hormonal therapy No
        concurrent steroids No concurrent hormonal therapy (except leuprolide acetate for prostate
        cancer) Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy to 30% or more of bone
