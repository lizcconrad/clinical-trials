      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's melanoma cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melanoma vaccine with
      that of interferon alfa-2b in treating patients who have stage III melanoma that has spread
      to regional lymph nodes following surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the relapse-free and overall survival rates in patients with stage III
      melanoma treated with autologous tumor vaccine versus interferon alfa-2b as postsurgical
      adjuvant therapy. II. Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to number of metastatic lymph node sites (1 vs more than 1), number of positive
      lymph nodes in a single site (none vs 1 or more), presence of intransit metastases (yes vs
      no), and evidence of extranodal extension (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive autologous tumor cell vaccine intradermally once a
      week for 7 weeks followed by a booster injection at 6 months. BCG is given concurrently with
      vaccine as an immune-stimulator for doses 2-8. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide 6 days
      after the first vaccine injection. Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b IV for 5
      consecutive days a week for 4 weeks followed by maintenance doses given subcutaneously 3
      times a week for 48 weeks. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1
      year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 386-425 patients will be accrued for this study.
