  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in
      patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the
      development of choroidal neovascular membrane formation (CNVM). Several clinical trials have
      proven that eyes with &quot;well-defined&quot; CNVM or lesions that can be readily demarcated with
      fluorescein angiography can be successfully treated with laser photocoagulation. However, up
      to 87% of eyes present with &quot;ill-defined&quot; CNVM or lesions that cannot be well demarcated on
      fluorescein angiography and are not amenable to laser photocoagulation. No beneficial
      treatment for this form of choroidal neovascularization has been established.

      Histopathologic study has demonstrated the presence of inflammatory and reparative responses
      in the retina of patients with ill-defined choroidal neovascularization. Since
      corticosteroids have been shown to downregulate many of the cellular factors involved in both
      inflammation and repair, the present study is designed to assess the ability of
      corticosteroid injection around the eye to prevent severe vision loss associated with
      &quot;ill-defined&quot; choroidal neovascularization in the setting of age-related macular
      degeneration. The study will be organized as a randomized open label control clinical trial
      involving 2 phases. Phase 1 involving 40 patients will establish the feasibility and safety
      of this treatment modality. Phase 2 will place emphasis on efficacy of the study.

        Diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen in one eye and age over 50.

        Vision 20/400 or worse in the fellow eye due to exudative complications from CNVM under the
        fovea.

        Visual acuity of 20/80 - 20/200 in the study eye.

        Ineligibility for a clinically proven laser photocoagulation protocol.

        No patients with age less than 50.

        No patients with previous laser therapy for surgery for choroidal neovascularization in the
        study eye.

        No patients with choroidal neovascularization, in the study eye, associated with other
        ocular diseases such as pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis, posterior uveitis,
        idiopathic, etc.

        No patients with presence of geographic atrophy or serous pigment epithelial detachment
        under the fovea in the study eye.

        No patients with decreased vision, in the study eye, due to retinal disease not
        attributable to ill-defined CNVM, such as serous retinal pigment epithelial detachment,
        nonexudative form of ARM, geographic atrophy, inherited retinal dystrophy, uveitis,
        epiretinal membrane and others.

        No patients with decreased vision, in the study eye, due to significant media opacity such
        as corneal disease or cataract.

        No patients with systemic or local therapy that may alter the natural course of ill-defined
        CNVM, especially antiangiogenic treatment with thalidomide or alpha interferon.

        No patients with intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 26 or history suggesting
        glaucoma (e.g., history of the diagnosis of glaucoma, past or present use of medications to
        control intraocular pressure, or disc/nerve fiber layer defects suggestive of glaucoma) and
        glaucomatous visual field defects as documented by Goldmann or Humphrey perimetry taken
        within 6 months to qualification.

        No patients with any contraindications to performing the necessary diagnostic studies,
        especially the use of fluorescein angiography.

        No patients with known history of untoward complications from corticosteroid therapy,

        corticosteroids.

        No patients with medical problems which make consistent follow-up over the treatment period
        unlikely (e.g., stroke, severe MI, terminal carcinoma.

        be toxic to the lens, retina or optic nerve, such as: Deferoxamine,
        Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), Tamoxifen, Chlorpromazine, Phenothiazines,
