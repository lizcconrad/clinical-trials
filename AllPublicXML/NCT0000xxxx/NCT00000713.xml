  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of ampligen at several doses in HIV-infected patients who have not
      yet developed AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC). Biologic, antiviral, and
      immunologic effects will be studied.

      Evidence indicates that a long period with no symptoms follows infection with HIV.
      Individuals who are infected with the virus could benefit from therapy with a drug that acts
      to kill the virus or to stimulate the immune system of the individual or both. The immune
      system is the means the human body has for fighting infections. Ampligen is a suitable drug
      for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and
      to inhibit HIV in vitro (test tube) at drug levels that can be achieved without noticeable
      clinical side effects.

      Evidence indicates that a long period with no symptoms follows infection with HIV.
      Individuals who are infected with the virus could benefit from therapy with a drug that acts
      to kill the virus or to stimulate the immune system of the individual or both. The immune
      system is the means the human body has for fighting infections. Ampligen is a suitable drug

      to inhibit HIV in vitro (test tube) at drug levels that can be achieved without noticeable
      clinical side effects.

      Individuals entered in the study are given ampligen by intravenous infusion once during the
      first week of the trial and twice a week during the following 8 weeks. The dose each
      individual receives is determined by the responses of earlier individuals. Each is followed
      for 12 weeks after the last dose of ampligen is given. Each individual maintains a daily
      diary listing any symptoms or problems that occur, such as headache, nausea, or change in
      appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen
      should not be taken for more than 2 hours without consulting the research staff. Blood is
      drawn at intervals during the trial and follow-up and used to determine the effect of
      ampligen on the HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor any toxicity and side
      effects.
