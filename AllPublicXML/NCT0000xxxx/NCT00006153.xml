  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving a vaccine (Remune) is effective in HIV-positive
      patients who are also taking anti-HIV therapy.

      Regular treatment of HIV-positive patients with anti-HIV drugs slows the multiplication of
      the HIV virus in the body. A vaccine called Remune works to stop the virus infection by
      &quot;boosting&quot; the body's immune cell defense against the HIV virus before the virus enters
      cells. It also blocks the virus from entering the cells. This study will see whether Remune
      will improve the immune cell natural defense in patients who are also taking anti-HIV drugs.

    <textblock>
      During primary HIV infection, after an initial burst in viral load, the body mounts an
      immunologic response to viral antigens. It is thought that this initial immune response plays
      an important role in determining early and long-term suppression of HIV. However, limited
      information is available regarding the effect of early antiretroviral therapy on immune
      responses. Therapeutic approaches such as Remune, which augment cell-mediated immunologic
      responses, may prove to be beneficial in controlling the progression of HIV infection,
      especially when used in combination with antiretroviral therapy in early infection. Current
      antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the infection of new cells yet seem to suppress early
      cell-mediated immune responses. The question is raised as to whether immune-based therapies
      such as Remune may counteract the suppressive effects of antiretrovirals and slow the
      progression of infection.

      Patients receiving fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy are randomized to add either
      Remune or an Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) control. Vaccinations are administered on Day
      1, Week 12, and Week 24. Blood samples are collected at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, and
      28. Clinical assessment includes lymphocyte proliferative response, cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      (CTL) memory cell activity, chemokine and cytokine measurements, CD4 count, and viral load.
      Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests are performed at Day 1 and Week 28. HIV-1
      specific immunogenicity is coordinated with the response to antiretroviral therapy in
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive and started anti-HIV drugs soon after tests showed the presence of
             HIV.

          -  Have been on an anti-HIV drug combination that includes a protease inhibitor for at
             least 3 months but no longer than 12 months.

          -  Have 2 consecutive viral loads of less than 50 copies/ml, at least 30 days apart,
             within 90 days of study entry.

          -  Are at least 16 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18 years).

          -  Agree to practice abstinence or use effective methods of birth control during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Currently abuse alcohol or drugs.

          -  Are currently being treated for some types of cancer.

          -  Have any illness or condition that might interfere with the study or put them at risk.

          -  Have received a vaccination 6 weeks before study entry.

          -  Have previously received Remune.

          -  Are taking medications that affect the immune system within 30 days of study entry.
