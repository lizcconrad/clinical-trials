      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether defects in fibrillin-1 cellular processing are present in
      the tsk1 mouse model that carries a known FBN1 gene rearrangement and in a population of
      Choctaw Native American patients with systemic sclerosis who have a strong genetic
      predisposition to the disease.

      II. Determine the ultrastructural features of fibrillin-1 in these patients. III. Screen the
      FBN1 gene for mutations beginning at the regions homologous to the tsk1 duplication and
      latent transforming growth factor binding proteins in these patients and in an unaffected
      Choctaw control group.

      IV. Determine the correlation between fibrillin-1 abnormalities and clinical presentation,
      autoantibodies, and ethnicity.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo punch skin biopsy obtained from the upper arm or back. Studies of
      fibrillin-1 synthesis and cellular processing, and FBN1 mutational analysis, linkage
      analysis, and genetic mapping are performed on the tissue samples. Patients from all major US
      ethnic groups (Caucasian, Hispanic, African Americans) will be recruited for the study in the
      next 2 years.
