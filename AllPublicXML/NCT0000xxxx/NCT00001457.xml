  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. It affects
      nearly 1 million Americans. Approximately 25% of patients with chronic hepatitis B will
      develop liver cirrhosis and 5% of patients will develop liver cancer.

      Presently, two medications have been shown effective in the treatment of hepatitis B:
      lamivudine and alpha interferon. Alpha interferon (an antiviral drug that acts through the
      immune system) is given by injection once daily or three times a week for four to six months.
      Lamivudine (also known as 3-thiacytidine: 3TC) is an antiviral medication given as a pill
      once a day for twelve months. These treatments have been known to provide long-term
      improvement in one third of patients receiving them.

      In previous research, the drug lamivudine was shown to stop the growth of the hepatitis B
      virus and to lead marked decreases in the levels of hepatitis B virus and to improvements in
      the disease in 50 to 70% of patients. However, once lamivudine therapy was discontinued the
      virus returned to levels noted before the therapy began. In those studies lamivudine was
      given for 3 to 12 months then discontinued. This study will investigate the safety and
      effectiveness of long-term therapy with lamivudine.

      This study will select 60 patients diagnosed with hepatitis B. After a thorough medical
      examination and liver biopsy, subjects will be given lamivudine. The drug will be taken by
      mouth in tablet form (100 mg) once a day for up to 5 years. Subjects will undergo regular
      check-ups and after 1 year of therapy be admitted to the Clinical Center for another medical
      examination and liver biopsy to assess progress. Patients who have benefitted from the
      therapy will continue taking the medication for up to 5 years. A third liver biopsy will be
      done during the last year of treatment. The effectiveness of lamivudine will be determined by
      whether levels of hepatitis B virus decrease in the blood, whether liver enzymes improve, and
      whether inflammation and scarring decreases in the liver biopsies.

      To assess the safety, antiviral activity and clinical benefit of lamivudine (3-thiacytidine:
      3TC) in chronic hepatitis B, we will treat 60 patients with oral lamivudine in a dose of 100
      mg daily for up to five years. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue which is used extensively
      in patients with HIV infection and is being studied in controlled trials in chronic hepatitis
      B. In this study, we will evaluate lamivudine in patients with four different forms of
      chronic hepatitis B: (A) Atypical serology (HBeAg negative), (B) extra-hepatic
      manifestations, (C) chronic delta hepatitis, (D) typical HBeAg- positive chronic hepatitis B.
      After evaluation and liver biopsy, patients will receive lamivudine, 100 mg orally once daily
      for 1 year, being monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver disease, side effects
      of lamivudine, serum biochemical and hematologic indices, and serologic markers of hepatitis
      B (and D) virus replication. At one year, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation and
      liver biopsy. If there is virologic, biochemical or histologic evidence of benefit, therapy
      will be continued thereafter for up to 5 years. Patients who develop viral resistance to
      lamivudine may be offered therapy with higher doses of lamivudine (300 mg per day). The
      activity of lamivudine will be assessed by changes in levels of HBV DNA or HDV RNA during
      treatment and its efficacy by loss of viral markers and improvements in aminotransferases and
      liver histology.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Age 18 years or above, male or female.

        Known presence of HBsAg in serum for at least 6 months.

        Liver biopsy histology showing chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis.

        Previous therapy with alpha interferon without a lasting effect or intolerance to alpha
        interferon, due to side effects.

        Written informed consent.

        Group A: For patients with chronic hepatitis B with atypical serology: absence of HBeAg
        from serum despite elevations in serum aminotransferases, such as that the average levels
        are greater than 55 U/L (approximately 1.3 times the upper limit of the normal range) based
        upon two determinations taken at least one month apart during the 6 months before entry.

        Group B: For patients with glomerulonephritis: proteinuria of greater than 1 gm per 24
        hours. For patients with polyarteritis, radiological proof of arteritis and involvement of
