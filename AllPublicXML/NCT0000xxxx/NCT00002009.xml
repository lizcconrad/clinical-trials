      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of sargramostim (recombinant
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) given by continuous intravenous
      infusion (CIV) in patients with leukopenia in association with AIDS virus infection. In
      addition, single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics will also be determined.
