  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of adefovir dipivoxil and indinavir administered orally
      in combination with zidovudine, lamivudine, or stavudine in HIV-infected patients with CD4
      cell counts &gt;= 100 cells/mm3 and an HIV-1 RNA baseline copy number &gt;= 5000 copies/ml. To
      determine the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level falls below the level of
      detection (500 copies/ml) by 20 weeks of study therapy and the average reduction in HIV-1 RNA
      from baseline through study week 20. To evaluate the durability of the antiviral response
      through 48 weeks of study in patients who continue on study therapy after week 24.

      This protocol is a stratified, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of
      adefovir dipivoxil with indinavir as quadruple therapy in combination with zidovudine and
      lamivudine, or as triple combination administered with either zidovudine or lamivudine or
      stavudine for 48 weeks in the treatment of HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts &gt;=
      100/mm3 and an HIV-1 RNA baseline copy number &gt;= 5000 copies/ml. Patients will be randomized
      to adefovir dipivoxil, indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil,
      indinavir, and a nucleoside inhibitor (randomly assigned to receive zidovudine, lamivudine,
      or stavudine) or to indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Additionally, a daily dose of
      L-carnitine will be administered to all patients randomized to an arm containing adefovir
      dipivoxil.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection (positive HIV antibody test confirmed by Western
             blot, p24 antigen assay, HIV-1 RNA, or HIV-1 culture).

          -  An HIV-1 RNA plasma titer &gt;= 5000 copies/ml within 14-21 days prior to the baseline
             visit.

          -  CD4 cell count &gt;= 100 cells/mm3 within 14-21 days prior to the baseline visit.

          -  A minimum life expectancy of at least 1 year.

          -  Signed, informed consent from parent or legal guardian for those patients &lt; 18 years
             of age.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with any of the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Active, serious infections (other than HIV infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic
             or antiviral therapy. Patients will be considered recovered from such infectious
             episodes if at least 2 weeks elapsed following the cessation of parenteral therapy
             before the baseline visit.

          -  Exhibiting evidence of a gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or chronic nausea or
             vomiting which may confer an inability to receive an orally administered medication.

          -  Malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) or basal cell carcinoma.
             Patients with biopsy-confirmed cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received
             any systemic therapy for KS within 4 weeks prior to baseline and are not anticipated
             to require systemic therapy during the study.

          -  Any other clinical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the
             patient unsuitable for study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements.

        Patients with any of the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  A new AIDS-defining event diagnosed within 1 month prior to baseline.

          -  Any patient who has previously been discontinued from zidovudine, lamivudine, and/or
             stavudine due to a drug-related toxicity.

          -  Significant history of peripheral neuropathy.

             1. Treatment with immunomodulating agents such as systemic corticosteroids, IL-2, or
             interferons.

          -  Saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, nevirapine, delavirdine, didanosine,
             dideoxycytidine, interferon alpha, interferon beta, isoniazid, rifampin,
             investigational agents (except upon Sponsor approval), chemotherapeutic agents
             (systemic), terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and midazolam.

             1. Prior use of adefovir dipivoxil.

          -  Prior non-protease antiretroviral therapy (other than antiretroviral vaccines) for
             greater than 4 cumulative weeks.

          -  Prior use of any antiretroviral protease inhibitor.

          -  Immunizations within 30 days of baseline.

          -  Antiretroviral vaccine therapy within 60 days of baseline.

          -  Treatment in the 4 weeks prior to baseline, with immunomodulating agents such as
             systemic corticosteroids, IL-2, or interferons.

          -  Any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to baseline.

          -  Any prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient
             unsuitable for study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements.

        Patients with current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially
        interfere with patient compliance.
