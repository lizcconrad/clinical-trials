      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus carmustine in treating
      patients who have recurrent primary malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered in combination
      with a fixed dose of carmustine in patients with recurrent primary malignant glioma. II.
      Determine the toxic effects of irinotecan and carmustine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over
      90 minutes weekly on weeks 1-4 and carmustine IV over 1 hour on weeks 1-6. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences
      dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
