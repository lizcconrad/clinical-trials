  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To compare the pharmacokinetics of biweekly and monthly dose regimens of intravenous
      pentamidine in HIV-infected infants and children who require PCP prophylaxis and who are
      intolerant to oral trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole. To determine the safety and tolerance of
      these regimens in this patient population.

      Secondary: To obtain information on the rate of PCP breakthrough in infants and children
      receiving parenteral pentamidine prophylaxis.

      Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is recommended for all HIV-infected
      children considered to be at high risk. In children younger than 5 years of age with
      intolerance to trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole, parenteral pentamidine may be a successful
      alternative.

      Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is recommended for all HIV-infected
      children considered to be at high risk. In children younger than 5 years of age with
      intolerance to trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole, parenteral pentamidine may be a successful
      alternative.

      Thirty-two children are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients receive pentamidine
      on either a biweekly or a monthly treatment schedule. Treatment continues until the last
      child enrolled has received at least 6 months of pentamidine. Patients are stratified
      according to age &lt; 24 months or age &gt;= 24 months. Steady-state pharmacokinetics will be
      examined in a subsample of 20 patients.

             participating in ACTG 179.

        NOTE:

          -  Co-enrollment in other ACTG pediatric studies is permitted.

        Consent of parent or guardian is required.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Prior pentamidine.
