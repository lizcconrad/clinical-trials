      RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as enhanced ultrasound may improve the ability to
      determine the extent of breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic study of enhanced ultrasound in women who have locally advanced primary
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Measure blood flow of primary breast lesions and corresponding lymph nodes by
      Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDU) and compare this information with metastatic potential and
      patient survival in women with primary breast cancer. II. Correlate intratumor/-nodal blood
      flow with pathological variables using standard histology and special stains in this patient
      population. III. Correlate intratumor microvessel density with total tumor blood flow and
      with the presence of axillary lymph node metastases using this diagnostic method in these
      patients. IV. Correlate tumor blood flow with various markers of angiogenesis using this
      diagnostic method in these patients. V. Compare tumor blood flow as measured with PDU before
      and after contrast enhancement in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive ultrasound contrast agent IV. An
      ultrasound probe with Power Doppler facility is swept over the skin surface in a standard
      fashion before and after contrast enhancement. Blood flow data is acquired over the volume of
      the mass and/or lymph nodes using a video recorder. The scanning time ranges between 5 to 15
      minutes depending on the size and exact location of the breast mass and axillary lymph nodes.
      Within 1 week of the ultrasound, patients undergo surgery and the mass and axillary lymph
      nodes are removed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
