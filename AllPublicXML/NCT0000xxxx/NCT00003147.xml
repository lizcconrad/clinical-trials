  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy with the p53 gene in treating
      patients who have cancer of the liver that cannot be surgically removed. Inserting the p53
      gene into a person's tumor may improve the body's ability to fight liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety of adenovirus p53 construct (adeno-p53) in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      II. Investigate the potential effects of intralesional adeno-p53 given by monthly
      percutaneous injections in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive adenovirus p53 construct by percutaneous injection to a maximum of two
      lesions on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses. In the absence of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cohort of 6 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of
      6 patients each receive escalating doses of the drug on the same schedule. If DLT occurs in 2
      of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and that dose is declared
      the maximum tolerated dose. Study treatment may continue in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable adverse events.
