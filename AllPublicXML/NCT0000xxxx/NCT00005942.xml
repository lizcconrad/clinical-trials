      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal daunorubicin and SU5416 in treating
      patients who have hematologic cancer that has not responded to initial therapy. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. SU5416 may stop the growth of hematologic cancer by stopping blood flow to the cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when administered with daunorubicin
      liposomal in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, refractory anemia with excess blasts
      (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia not in complete remission
      21-50 days after one course of induction chemotherapy.

      II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the qualitative
      and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of SU5416.

      Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over 6 hours on days 1-3 and SU5416 IV twice a
      week for 2 months. The second course is administered for 1 month, then treatment continues
      every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with AML, RAEB, RAEB-T or CMML-T that are not in CR 21-50 days after
             beginning course one of initial induction chemotherapy; patients may not have received
             more than 1 prior course of chemotherapy prior to study entry; this must contain Ara-C

             at standard doses (i.e., daunorubicin =&lt; 65 mg/m^2 daily x 3 days, or idarubicin 12
             mg/m^2 daily x 3 days); patients beginning liposomal Daunorubicin on days 21 to 42 of
             course one must have persistent blasts in bone marrow or blood without evidence of
             improvement; patients beginning liposomal Daunorubicin on days 42 to 50 may or may not
             have persistent blasts but must have thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that is not
