      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Dexamethasone may be effective in slowing the growth of prostate cancer cells. It is not yet
      known whether SU5416 or dexamethasone is more effective in treating progressive prostate
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of SU5416 with that of
      dexamethasone in treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer that has not
      responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the time to progression in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer
           treated with dexamethasone with or without SU5416.

        -  Determine the differences in PSA kinetics and PSA hazard score between these two
           regimens in this patient population.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and time to development of new lesions in these
           patients treated with SU5416.

        -  Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dexamethasone once a day 6 days a week. Treatment continues
           until disease progression, at which time patients cross over to arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dexamethasone as in arm I followed by SU5416 IV over 60
           minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. A smaller dose of dexamethasone is administered the
           day after SU5416. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      16 months.
