  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and utility of bacteriophage phi X174
      immunization as a tool to assess the immune competence of HIV-infected patients at different
      stages of disease in vivo, and to assess the impact of viral load levels and therapy-induced
      changes in viral load levels on the response to immunization with the neo-antigen
      bacteriophage phi X174. Bacteriophage phi X174 immunization is a method that has been in use
      for more than 25 years to assess the immunity of patients with various types of primary and
      secondary immunodeficiencies, including 48 HIV-infected patients. This is a prospective
      open-label, controlled study which will enroll 39 HIV-infected patients and 13 healthy
      volunteers, male or female with 18 years of age and over. The HIV-infected patients will be
      divided into 3 groups according to their CD4 cell count: less than 200 cells/mm(3), between
      200 and 500 cells/mm(3) and greater than 500 cells/mm(3). After screening and a two week
      pre-study evaluation, all eligible participants will receive a primary, secondary and
      tertiary immunization with 2 x 10(9) PFU/kg of bacteriophage phi X174 six weeks apart.
      Patients who present with detectable levels of viral load at entry will be offered a more
      effective antiviral drug regimen. Patients will have to be on a stable antiviral regimen for
      at least one month prior to receiving the primary immunization. Patients will return for
      visits 1, 2 and 4 weeks after each immunization for clinical and laboratory evaluations. The
      study endpoints are: safety (as measured by incidence of adverse events, CD4 cell count and
      HIV plasma RNA), kinetics of bacteriophage clearance following primary immunization,
      quantitation of bacteriophage phi X174 specific antibody titers following primary, secondary
      and tertiary immunizations and determination of qualitative and quantitative antibody isotype
      switching following secondary and tertiary immunizations.
