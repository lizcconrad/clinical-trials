  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterococci, especially vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), are increasing in prevalence
      in many hospitals in the United States. Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at
      particular risk for developing infection due to VRE. The effect of prior colonization with
      VRE on the outcome of liver transplantation is unknown. This prospective study will ascertain
      the prevalence of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin resistant enterococci among
      patients awaiting liver transplantation at the University of Michigan Health System. Risk
      factors for acquisition of the organism, natural history of colonization and outcome in
      colonized patients will also be determined. All patients currently listed on a priority
      waiting list for liver transplantation at UMHS will be invited to participate. Patients will
      receive a standardized letter from their primary gastroenterologist describing the rationale
      for the study. Patients will be contacted by telephone by a member of the study team in order
      to arrange an appointment in the GCRC at the time of their regularly scheduled Transplant
      Clinic appointment in order discuss their potential participation in the study. Patients who
      give informed consent, will be interviewed using a standard interview questionnaire.
      Demographic and historical data relevant to the risk of VRE colonization will be collected
      during the interview. A sample will be obtained via rectal swab for culture. Rectal swabs for
      culture and collection of information on the standardized questionnaire will be repeated
      every six months while the patient is awaiting liver transplantation. When a patient
      undergoes liver transplantation, a culture will be obtained at the time of admission and
      weekly after post-operatively until discharge. All patients will be followed for 60 days
      after transplantation to assess several primary outcomes, including operative and
      post-operative complications, VRE infection and mortality. Rectal swabs will be the only
      procedure performed for the purposes of this study. Culture results will not be made
      available to the transplant team in order to avoid bias in clinical care. All data will be
      entered into an electronic database. GCRC statisticians will assist in the analysis of risk
      factors and outcome analysis.
