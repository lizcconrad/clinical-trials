  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in the original Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study at the Clinical
      Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute will be invited for a follow-up visit at the
      National Eye Institute. Visual function will be assessed with manifest refraction and
      standardized visual acuity measurement. The progression of retinopathy will be evaluated by
      ocular exam and fundus photography. A brief medical history will be obtained. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate the long-term results of patients whose diabetic retinopathy was
      treated with different strategies of scatter and/or focal laser photocoagulation.
