      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the degree of amnesia afforded by study sedatives relative to the patient's
      intensive care unit experiences.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of propofol monotherapy compared to a conventional
      sedative regimen consisting of continuous infusion fentanyl and midazolam.

      III. Perform a detailed pharmacoeconomic evaluation of propofol sedation compared to
      combination drug therapy in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated pediatric patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double blind study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either a continuous infusion of propofol or a continuous
      infusion combination of fentanyl and midazolam preceded by a loading dose. Sedative doses may
      be reduced if necessary. Treatment is continued until sedation is no longer needed, any other
      sedative therapy is administered, or unacceptable toxicity is experienced.

      Patients are assessed after extubation, just prior to hospital discharge, and then every 2
      months for 6 months after hospital discharge.
