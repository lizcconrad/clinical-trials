  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy(HAART), patients with HIV disease
      are developing a series of metabolic abnormalities including peripheral fat wasting, increase
      in truncal fat, high serum triglyceride levels, insulin(a hormone that controls blood sugar)
      resistance with an increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and elevated blood
      pressure. The premise of this study is that abnormalities in the ability of fat and muscle
      tissue to respond to the hormone insulin may be the cause of the diabetes mellitus, high
      serum triglyceride levels and abnormal fat distribution. The purpose of the study is to
      assess how insulin resistant patients with HIV disease are and if their fat and muscle tissue
      are responding abnormally to insulin. This is done by administering insulin and taking small
      tissue samples of fat and muscle from the upper thigh and assessing how good insulin acts in
      these tissues.

      Patients with HIV disease will be admitted into the study after undergoing a screening
      medical history and examination. Once patients qualify, they will have their insulin
      resistance measured as well as the response of their fat and muscle to insulin; blood levels
      of glucose (sugar), cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured; body fat will be assessed
      using radiological tests; a detailed medical history will be obtained to assess risk factors
      for developing this syndrome.

      Patients who are found to be insulin resistant will be offered a trial of an insulin
      sensitizing agent, called Avandia, for 6-12 weeks. It is hoped that the Avandia will restore
      the body's ability to respond normally to insulin (as it does in patients with Diabetes) and
      perhaps improve the fat abnormalities as well. All the same measures will be performed at the
      end of the course of Avandia as were done at baseline.

      Patients who are not insulin resistant will be asked to come back yearly to assess whether
      they develop insulin resistance over time. This study will continue to recruit patients over
      the next 3 years.
