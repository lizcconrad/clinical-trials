  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the appropriate duration of amphotericin B therapy for Candida esophagitis. To
      compare the effectiveness of two different amphotericin B doses in the treatment of
      biopsy-proven Candida esophagitis. To determine if low-dose amphotericin B is less toxic than
      standard dose therapy during a limited treatment period. To evaluate pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic parameters of the two different dosing regimens.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic administration of amphotericin B for a proven or suspected systemic fungal
             infection.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Documented Candida fungemia.

          -  Histological or clinical (skin rash, cotton wool exudates, Candida endophthalmitis,
             etc.) evidence of disseminated candidiasis.

          -  Systemic administration of amphotericin B for a proven or suspected systemic fungal
             infection.

          -  Patient refusal to enter study.

        Patient must be an immunosuppressed host, with biopsy-proven Candida esophagitis.

          -  Patients with polymicrobial esophagitis will be included as long as Candida
             esophagitis is documented by esophageal biopsy.

          -  Informed consent must be signed and obtained.
