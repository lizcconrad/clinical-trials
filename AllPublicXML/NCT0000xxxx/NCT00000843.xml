  <brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Adefovir Dipivoxil in HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase IA Single Dose Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of the Oral Antiviral Compound, 9-[2-(Bispivaloyloxymethyl)Phosphonylmethoxyethyl]Adenine (Bis-POM PMEA) (Adefovir Dipivoxil) in Children With HIV-1 Infection</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile and acute toxicity of bis-POM PMEA (
      adefovir dipivoxil ) in HIV-1 infected children, and to determine whether age-related
      differences exist. To ascertain dosages that may be suitable for a multiple-dose evaluation
      in this patient population.

      Although the oral bioavailability of PMEA ( adefovir ) is low, the prodrug bis-POM PMEA has
      resulted in increased bioavailability in adult patients in clinical trials. However, the
      safety and pharmacokinetic patterns of drugs in infants often differ from those of adults and
      the direction of the variation is not predictable. This study will assess these parameters of
      bis-POM PMEA in children.

      Although the oral bioavailability of PMEA ( adefovir ) is low, the prodrug bis-POM PMEA has
      resulted in increased bioavailability in adult patients in clinical trials. However, the
      safety and pharmacokinetic patterns of drugs in infants often differ from those of adults and
      the direction of the variation is not predictable. This study will assess these parameters of
      bis-POM PMEA in children.

      Patients are stratified by age, and separate cohorts from each age group receive 1 of 2
      single doses of bis-POM PMEA. The lower dose is given to patients ages 3 months through 17
      years; if toxicity is acceptable, the other cohort in this age range receives the higher
      dose. At this point, accrual of infants &lt; 3 months old may begin at the lower dose, followed
      by accrual of this age group at the higher dose if toxicity is acceptable. Serum drug
      concentrations are monitored up to 8 hours post dose.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 5/2/97: Based on data from both the low- and high-dose cohorts of the older
      age group (&gt;= 3 months to &lt; 18 years), the younger age group (&lt;3 months) will be started at
      the high-dose.
