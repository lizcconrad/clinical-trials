      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients with
      metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of bryostatin 1 in chemotherapy naive patients
      with metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, not curable with surgery
      or radiation therapy. II. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of bryostatin 1 when administered
      in the prescribed schedule in this patient population. III. Assess cyclin dependent kinase 2
      activity, protein kinase C activity, and apoptosis measurements in selected patients with
      tumors accessible for biopsy following bryostatin 1 therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours once weekly for three weeks followed
      by one week of rest. Treatment is continued every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable disease after two courses may continue
      treatment or stop treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 14-25 patients accrued into this study over 1-2 years.
