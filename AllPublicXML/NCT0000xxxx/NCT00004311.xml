      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate insulin resistance in thin and obese hyperandrogenic women with
      polycystic ovarian disease or hyperandrogenism insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans
      syndrome and in thin and obese controls, using an estimation of tissue sensitivity to
      insulin.

      II. Evaluate the effect of androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate and spironolactone on
      insulin secretion and resistance.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are treated with subcutaneous leuprolide acetate followed by
      oral spironolactone. Each treatment is administered daily for 6 weeks, with a 6-week washout
      between drugs.

      Patients and controls are alternately assigned to begin treatment with leuprolide acetate or
      spironolactone.
