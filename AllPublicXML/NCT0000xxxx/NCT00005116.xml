  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most common emotional problems among youths with insulin dependent
      diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It has been shown that depression in youths with IDDM lasts a while
      and may have a role in later complications of the medical condition. And yet, there are no
      psychological interventions appropriate for such youngsters. The purpose of this study is to
      modify a treatment called ''Contextual Psychotherapy'' (that has been developed for depressed
      youngsters) in order to address special needs of depressed youths with IDDM, and to ''pilot
      test'' the treatment. The youngsters to be recruited are those being cared for at the
      Diabetes Clinic of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The treatment includes a 3- month
      phase (16 sessions), followed by a 3-month ''booster'' phase (3 sessions), and two later
      follow-up evaluations.
