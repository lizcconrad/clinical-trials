  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia provide very
      limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest
      that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's
      Macroglobulinemia.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's
      Macroglobulinemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia patients receive gradually escalating
      doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum
      tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Recurrent or
           Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, as measured by an objective response to
           therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
