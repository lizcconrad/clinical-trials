      This study will determine whether patients who have been infected with the Lyme bacteria,
      Borrelia burgdorferi, and treated with antibiotics still have the bacteria alive inside them
      and whether it is causing their symptoms. The information from this study may serve as a
      basis for developing stringent diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease and the establishment of
      future treatment trials.

      Individuals in the following categories may be eligible for this study: chronic Lyme disease;
      chronic Lyme arthritis; seropositive control (are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme
      disease but do not have disease symptoms); recovered control (have been sick with Lyme
      disease but were treated successfully and are currently well); control with multiple
      sclerosis (patients with multiple sclerosis); and healthy volunteers. Patients in the chronic
      Lyme disease category must be age 13 and above; all others must be age18 and above.
      Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests.

      Participants will have a physical examination and the following tests:

      Blood tests Includes HLA-typing, a genetic test of immune system markers;

      Leukapheresis Collection of large numbers of white blood cells Whole blood is collected
      through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it
      into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the
      body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through another needle in the
      other arm. (Alternatively, patients will 100 cc (about 7 tablespoons) of blood drawn.);

      Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, fluid that bathes the
      brain and spinal cord). A local anesthetic is administered and a needle is inserted in the
      space between the bones in the lower back where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the
      spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle;

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain Imaging of the brain using a strong magnetic
      field and radio waves instead of X-rays. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a
      narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an
      intercom at all times during the procedure;

      Neuropsychologic testing;

      Some participants may also have a hearing test and urine collection.

      Participants whose test results are positive for Borrelia burgdorferi will be followed at NIH
      at intervals of 3 to 6 months until it is determined whether there is infection. Those who
      are infected will be offered treatment with the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Following treatment,
      patients will return to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits 1 week after treatment
      and again at 3, 6 and 12 months. The lumbar puncture, hearing examination, blood and urine
      tests will be repeated at these visits to evaluate the response to treatment, and the
      leukapheresis will be repeated for research purposes. Patients whose MRI was abnormal during
      therapy will have a repeat MRI at the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year visits.

      All participants with chronic Lyme disease, chronic Lyme arthritis, seropositive controls and
      recovered controls may be reevaluated at intervals of 6 to 12 months.

      Lyme disease has emerged as the leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Despite
      how much has been learned about Lyme borreliosis in the past decade, there are still many
      remaining areas of uncertainty. One fundamental question is whether persistent signs and
      symptoms of disease, despite the administration of what is currently considered to be
      adequate antibiotic therapy, are due to ongoing active borrelial infection, to a
      post-infectious syndrome, to irreversible sequelae of earlier tissue injury or due to a
      condition unrelated to Lyme disease. Reliable objective markers of infection, of clinical
      status and of host responses to the organism are required to discern the scope and the
      implications of persistent borrelial infection, the effectiveness of current treatment
      options, and the development of new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this study is to
      assemble and follow a well-characterized cohort of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease
      syndrome and relevant controls that will yield a prospective database upon which stringent
      diagnostic criteria can be established and future therapeutic trials can be designed.

        Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS): For the purposes of this study, PTLDS is
        defined as occurring in male or female patients age 13 and above who have been diagnosed
        with confirmed or probable Lyme disease per CDC definition
        (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/lyme-disease/case-definition/2017/). Studyphysician
        will review history to confirm probable cases. They have received recommended antibiotic
        therapy and have persistent or relapsing symptoms and/or signs for at least six months
        after therapy. They also should have no other documented explanation for their signs and
        symptoms.

        Lyme arthritis controls: For the purposes of this study, Lyme arthritis is defined as
        occurring in an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who have intermittent
        episodes of arthritis involving one or few joint, without any other cause being documented,
        and have positive serum antibodies to B.burgdorferi confirmed by Western blot according to
        the CDC criteria.

        Recovered Controls: For the purposes of this study, a recovered control is defined as an
        otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has had Lyme disease, fulfilling the
        CDC Lyme Disease National Surveillance Case Definition and who had received accepted
        antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease (at least 3 months since the end of antibiotic
        therapy before protocol evaluation) and who are currently asymptomatic.

        Seropositive Controls: For the purposes of this study, a serpositive control is defined as
        an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has positive serum IgG antibody
        to B.burgdorferi by Western blot according to the CDC criteria and are asymptomatic and who
        recall no episodes of disease compatible with Lyme infection and have not received
        antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease.

        OspA vaccinated control: For the purposes of this study, a OspA vaccinated control is
        defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has received at least
        two doses of the OspA vaccine for Lyme disease (Lymerix [R]). These controls may have a
        positive ELISA for B.burgdorferi but a negative (or unreadable) IgG western blot.

        Multiple sclerosis controls: For the purposes of this study, a multiple sclerosis control
        is defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above with
        relapsing-remitting or progressive multiple sclerosis as defined by the Clinical Trial
        Committee of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and no evidence of prior exposure to
        B.burgdorferi as indicate by negative history for Lyme disease and negative Western blot
