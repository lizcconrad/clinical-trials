      RATIONALE: STI571 may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be an effective
      treatment for leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of STI571 in treating patients who have
      chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety profile of STI571 in patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in blast crisis. II. Provide expanded access of this treatment to these patients.
      III. Determine the rate of hematological response and duration of response in patients
      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the improvements in symptomatic parameters in
      patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the cytogenetic response in patients treated
      with this regimen. VI. Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an expanded-access, multicenter study. Patients receive oral STI571 daily.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who are considered to have benefited may continue treatment beyond 1 year.
