  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to learn more about the areas of the brain involved in the experience
      of positive and negative emotions.

      Patients who would like to participate in this study will first undergo a screening process
      to see if they will be eligible for the study. Patients eligible to participate in the study
      will go through two sessions.

      During session one, researchers will attempt to evoke positive and negative emotions by
      showing patients slides of different emotion-arousing stimuli (pictures of pleasant and
      unpleasant scenes). While patients are viewing these slides, researchers will be measuring
      patient's heart rate, sweating, and eye-blinking.

      During session two, patients will undergo an MRI of the brain while seeing similar
      emotion-arousing pictures as in session one. In addition, patients may be asked to play a
      simple computer game for a reward of money while researchers use the MRI to measure brain
      activity.

      Researchers hope to develop methods to evoke positive and negative emotions and
      simultaneously (at the same time) see brain activation in normal volunteers, alcoholics, and
      recovered alcoholics.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Objective: The purpose of this protocol is two-fold: 1) to determine how individual
      differences in evoked brain responses relate to generalized trait personality and behavior
      differences (as assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and behavioral measures),
      and 2) to determine whether individual differences in evoked brain responses relate
      specifically to genetic polymorphisms in genes governing neurotransmitter activity.

      Study population: Healthy non-alcoholic adult volunteers, healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17
      years (with or without a family history of alcohol use disorder), inpatient or outpatient
      alcoholics, and recovering alcoholics.

      Design: In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we will
      attempt to evoke positive and negative affect via several different standardized methods
      including: (1) pictures of emotion-arousing stimuli; (2) pictures of emotional facial
      expression; (3) cues signaling reward or punishment. This protocol is designed to cover many
      different functional magnetic imaging studies all using similar techniques to evoke and
      measure positive and negative affect in the brain. Most subjects will not participate in
      studies involving all the methods described in the protocol.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measure is differences in blood oxygenation dependent level
      (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and analyzed using AFNI software.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INPATIENT ALCOHOLICS:

          -  We will study up to 150 male and 150 female individuals who meet criteria for alcohol
             use disorders and are between the age of 18 and 65 years. Inpatient alcoholics will be
             recruited from the NIAAA protocol 05-AA-0121, Assessment and treatment of people with
             alcohol drinking problems.

          -  Inclusion criteria

               -  (1) Are physically healthy;

               -  (2) Are between 18-65 years of age (since age effects FMRI signal in ways that
                  have not yet been well-characterized);

               -  (2) Are right handed.

          -  Exclusion criteria:

               -  (1) Have ferromagnetic objects in their bodies which might be adversely affected
                  by MRI including implanted pacemakers, medication pumps, aneurysm clips; metallic
                  prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves or cochlear implants,
                  shrapnel fragments, permanent eye liner or small metal fragments in the eye that
                  welders and other metal works may have- any doubt about presence of these objects
                  will result in exclusion from this study), or if candidates are uncomfortable in
                  small closed spaces (have claustrophobia), or cannot lie comfortably on their
                  back for up to one hour;

               -  (2) Test HIV positive (since AIDS-related dementia compromises brain function);

               -  (3) Are not cleared on a neuromotor examination during the screening physical by
                  the medically responsible staff;

               -  (4) Are currently receiving psychotropic medication for emotional distress;

               -  (5) Are pregnant or lactating;

               -  (6) Have symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as indicated by the most recent
                  measurement within the past 30 days, as measured by the Clinical Institute
                  Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score greater than 8;

               -  (7) Have active homicidal or suicidal ideation.

             criteria for alcohol use disorders and are between the age of 18 and 65 years.
             Recovering alcoholics must be at least 3 month without alcohol use, and will be
             recruited from the NIAAA protocol 05-AA-0121, Assessment and treatment of people with
             alcohol drinking problems.

             for an alcohol use disorder and are between the age of 18 and 65 years and will be
             recruited from the NIAAA protocol 98-AA-0009, Screening Evaluation for NIAAA
