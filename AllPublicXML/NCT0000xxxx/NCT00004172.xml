      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's
      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with
      autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      damage tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of chemotherapy and
      filgrastim plus stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have previously untreated
      stage III or stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor response, survival, and disease free survival following
      high dose carboplatin, ifosfamide, and thiotepa with autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) support and consolidation radiotherapy to sites of pretreatment bulk disease in
      patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the toxicity of high dose
      chemotherapy in these patients. III. Compare the effectiveness of PBSC mobilization with high
      dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim (G-CSF) vs G-CSF alone in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization
      groups at the discretion of the attending physician: Group 1: Patients receive high dose
      cyclophosphamide IV over 6 hours and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) daily beginning
      24 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide and continuing until 3 days after blood counts
      have recovered and until PBSC are harvested. Group 2: Patients receive G-CSF SQ daily alone
      until PBSC are harvested. Both groups: PBSC are harvested on days 15-19 after
      cyclophosphamide infusion or when blood counts recover. Patients receive high dose
      carboplatin IV continuously, ifosfamide IV over 4 hours, and thiotepa IV over 1 hour on days
      -5 to -3. PBSC are reinfused beginning 48 hours after completion of combination chemotherapy.
      Patients receive G-CSF SQ beginning on day 0 and continuing until 3 days after blood counts
      have recovered. Sites of pretransplantation metastases greater than 3 cm are irradiated
      beginning after transplantation and after blood counts recover. Patients are followed every
      month for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
