      To assess the safety and efficacy of itraconazole versus placebo for prevention of
      histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts &lt; 150 cells/mm3 who reside where
      histoplasmosis is endemic. To assess the safety and efficacy of itraconazole for preventing
      other debilitating fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, recalcitrant
      oropharyngeal or vaginal candidiasis, and recurrent esophageal candidiasis.
