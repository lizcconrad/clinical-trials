      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Gene therapy such as oblimersen may make tumor cells more sensitive
      to chemotherapy drugs. Combining irinotecan and oblimersen may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen and irinotecan
      in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of
      augmerosen (G3139) administered in combination with irinotecan in patients with unresectable
      metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative
      toxicity of this drug combination in this patient population. III. Assess the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of this combination in these patients. IV. Document the antitumor activity
      of this drug combination in these patients in a phase II study. V. Determine the relevant
      biologic endpoints of treatment in tumor biopsies prior to and after therapy with G3139 at
      two dose levels and assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlations.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive augmerosen (G3139) IV
      continuously on days 1-7 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 6. Treatment continues
      every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of G3139 and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are
      accrued to receive treatment with G3139 and irinotecan at the recommended phase II dose.
      Patients are followed every 30 days until toxicity resolves.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study. A maximum of 55 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
