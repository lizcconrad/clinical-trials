      RATIONALE: Questionnaires that measure quality of life may improve the ability to plan
      treatment for children with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the quality of life in children treated
      for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the validity and reliability of a quality of life questionnaire
      (MM-QOL) that is being developed for patients with previously or currently treated childhood
      cancers.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (8-12 vs 13-20) and treatment (current vs previous). Patients are randomized to one of two
      arms of the study. Arm I (Reliability): Patients will complete the same questionnaire two
      weeks apart. (age 13-20 stratum closed as of 7/14/00) Arm II (Validity): Patients will
      complete a study questionnaire plus a Child Health Questionnaire. Patients between ages 8-12
      are interviewed and patients between ages 13-20 complete a written questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 716 patients (416 for arm I (208 for 8-12 age group and 208 for
      13-20 age group) and 300 for arm II (150 for 8-12 age group and 150 for 13-20 age group))
      will be accrued for this study.
