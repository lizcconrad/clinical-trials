      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of temozolomide in terms of complete and partial
      response rates in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression and overall
      survival in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the quality of life and changes
      in disease-related symptoms in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide daily on days 1-7
      and 15-21. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every
      4 weeks during study, and then every 8 weeks after study. Patients are followed for 1 month
      and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-60 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
        Eligible subtypes: Adenocarcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma Large cell carcinoma At least 1
        bidimensionally measurable lesion, at least 2 cm by 2 cm in perpendicular diameter on
        radiologic study Previously irradiated bony lesions are not considered measurable unless
        there is evidence of disease progression at that site prior to study No brain metastases

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy:
        More than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet

        documented liver metastases) Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2 times ULN (5 times ULN
        if documented liver metastases) Renal: Blood urea nitrogen no greater than 1.5 times ULN
        Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Other: No active nonmalignant systemic disease
        that would increase risk No frequent vomiting or medical condition that would interfere
        with oral medication intake (e.g., partial bowel obstruction) No other malignancy within
        the past 5 years except surgically cured carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell or

        chemotherapy No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease No other
        concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: See Disease
        Characteristics Prior radiotherapy for local control or as palliative therapy for a painful
        bony lesion allowed No prior radiotherapy to 50% or more of bone marrow At least 4 weeks
        since prior radiotherapy to 15% or more of bone marrow (2 weeks for radiotherapy to less
        than 15% of bone marrow) and recovered No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified
        Other: Recovered from any prior therapy No other concurrent investigational drugs
