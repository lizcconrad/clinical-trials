  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of anti-HIV CTL therapy in early stage patients and to verify the
      safety when combined with antiviral therapy with zidovudine/lamivudine/indinavir and low-dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2). To compare the effects on plasma and cell-associated viral load
      following combination drug therapy with and without antiviral CTL in early-stage patients. To
      study in detail the immune effects of lowering viral burden with antiviral combination drugs
      with and without T cell infusion on antiviral CTL activity, viral suppression and
      proliferation, circulating T cell phenotype, T cell apoptosis, CD4 cell numbers, DTH
      reaction, and inflammatory cytokine levels.

      In an HIV-infected person, there is an ongoing struggle between HIV replication and host
      immune control. In the past decade most therapeutic strategies have targeted the virus. This
      approach has been frustrated by viral mutation to evade drug sensitivity. Promising drugs
      have recently been approved and there are encouraging sustained results from combination
      antiviral chemotherapy. However, even the most potent drug regimens do not seem to be
      curative, may eventually lead to drug resistance and may not completely restore lost immune
      function. The addition of immune-based therapy to antiviral drugs may lead to better viral
      control.

      control.

      This study has 2 regimens of 8 patients each. Patients are randomized as to CTL infusion
      only. Patients are stratified by viral load (less than 10,000 copies/ml vs. greater than or
      equal to 10,000 copies/ml). All patients receive combination drug therapy with
      AZT/3TC/indinavir for 9 months at which time patients have the option of continuing their
      study regimen another year or changing therapy. Patients in the T cell treatment regimen
      (regimen 2) receive 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded autologous anti-HIV CTL at 3 and 6 months
      after beginning AZT/3TC/indinavir therapy. The second infusion is administered with low-dose
      sc IL-2 1 day before and 4 days following T cell infusion.
