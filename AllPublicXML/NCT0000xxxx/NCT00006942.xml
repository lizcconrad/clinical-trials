    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bryostatin 1 and cisplatin in treating
      patients who have advanced recurrent or residual ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall response rate and the complete response rate of patients with
      platinum-refractory ovarian cancer who are treated with infusional Bryostatin-1 given in
      combination with intravenous cisplatin.

      II. To estimate the duration of response in these patients. III. To obtain tissue in order to
      evaluate the molecular determinants of apoptosis including: p53 status, WAF1/CIP1 gene
      expression prior to and directly after chemotherapy, bcl-2 gene expression in vivo, bcl-2/bax
      ratio, p21, and the extent of apoptosis determined by the TdT assay; and the molecular
      determinants of DNA damage and repair including: expression levels of ERCC1.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously over 72 hours immediately followed by cisplatin
      IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced recurrent or residual ovarian, fallopian tube, or papillary primary
             peritoneal cancer which has been histologically confirmed

          -  Eligible patients include patients with measurable disease who have progressed while
             on chemotherapeutic treatment, patients with biopsy-proven persistent,
             clinically-measurable disease with best response as stable at the completion of
             planned first-line therapy, patients with persistent or recurrent disease with rising
             CA-125 to levels at least twice normal; the CA-125 increase must be documented by two
             independent measurements; no patient may have received more than two prior regimens of
             chemotherapy including first-line treatment

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 50% and
             an estimated survival of at least three months

          -  Measured or calculated clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min

          -  AGC &gt;= 1800/mm^3

          -  Plts &gt;= 100,000/mm^3

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl

          -  SGOT less than 2 x upper limit of normal

          -  Previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy must have been completed at least three weeks
             before treatment under this protocol

          -  Patients must have the ability to give voluntary informed consent and to comply with
             the treatment and required tests

          -  Because Bryostatin is of unknown teratogenic potential, women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must take adequate precautions to
             prevent pregnancy during treatment

          -  Patients with any non-malignant intercurrent illness (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             or central nervous system disease) which is either poorly controlled with currently
             available treatment, or is of such severity that the investigators deem it unwise to
             enter the patient on protocol shall be ineligible

          -  Patients currently being treated for severe infection or who are recovering from major
             surgery are ineligible until recovery is deemed complete by the investigator

          -  The extent of all evaluable and nonevaluable disease must be documented; pretreatment
             radiographic examinations should be done no earlier than 4 weeks (28 days) prior to
             the first course of chemotherapy; pre-treatment chemistries and CA-125 levels should
             be done no earlier than two weeks (14 days) prior to initiation of chemotherapy; (in
             calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done is
             considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on Monday, the Monday four weeks later
             would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient scheduling without
             exceeding the guidelines)
