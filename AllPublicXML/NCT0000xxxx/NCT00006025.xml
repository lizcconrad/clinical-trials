      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide plus irinotecan in
      treating patients who have recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan when
           administered with temozolomide in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen as measured by 6-month progression-free
           survival and objective tumor response in these patients.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are stratified
      according to concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (e.g., phenytoin,
      phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or primidone) (yes vs no).

      In phase I of the study, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and irinotecan IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 14. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients concurrently on EIAEDs undergo dose escalation of irinotecan. Cohorts of 3 to 6
      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      In phase II of the study, patients receive the same treatment as in phase I at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months until progression, and then every 4 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for phase I within 10 months and 48
      patients will be accrued for phase II within 6-8 months.
