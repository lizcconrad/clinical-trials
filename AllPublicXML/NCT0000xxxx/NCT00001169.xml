  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanisms of host immune response to intracellular protozoa will be investigated in patients
      with naturally acquired infection employing a variety of in-vitro techniques. Both
      non-specific and antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses will be assessed.
      Parasites will be isolated from patients, cultivated in-vitro, and characterized. Responses
      to chemotherapy will be assessed parasitologically, immunologically and clinically.

      The main purpose of this protocol is to permit us to see patients who are referred to us for
      diagnosis and treatment of known or suspected leishmaniasis (from the Peace Corps,
      Smithsonian Institution, tourists, etc.). In the process of working up these patients, we
      sometimes encounter parasite isolates that are useful for research. We also can perform tests
      of cell-mediated immune function to evaluate how patients are responding to therapy. In
      addition, the protocol permits us to observe therapeutic responses to other drugs besides
      pentavalent antimony, if necessary.
