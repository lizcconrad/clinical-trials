      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and combination chemotherapy
      followed by bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rate of patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab and high-dose carmustine,
      etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Compare the levels of soluble CD20 antigen and rituximab blood levels with
      patient outcomes in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive two doses of rituximab IV over 3-4 hours 1 week apart. Stem cells
      from the peripheral blood or bone marrow are collected at least 1 week after the second dose
      of rituximab. Following stem cell collection, patients receive a third dose of rituximab IV
      as above between days -10 and -6. Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy consisting of
      carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV twice daily and cytarabine IV on days -5 to -2, and
      melphalan IV on day -1. On day 0 patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation. After transplantation, patients receive a fourth dose of rituximab
      as above at approximately day 30, and then weekly over 4 weeks at approximately 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 year
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

    <description>Rituximab at 375 mg/m2 administered approximately one week apart prior to collection of the hematopoietic stem cells. Rituxan at a dose of 375 mg/m2 IV will be given either on the days prior to initiation of the BCNU (days -10 to -7) or on the same day that the BCNU is administered for the BEAM chemotherapy regimen (Day -6). A fourth infusion of Rituxan 375 mg/m2 will be given at 30 day (+/- 20 days) post-transplant. At approximately 6 months post-transplant, if the patients have not had progressive lymphoma, they will receive four weekly doses of Rituxan 375 mg/m2 IV.</description>
