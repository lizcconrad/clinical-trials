  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is assessing the effectiveness of using the Internet as a tool to facilitate the
      maintenance of weight lost in a behavioral weight control program. Participants attend a
      standard behavioral weight control intervention via Interactive Television and after 6 months
      are randomly assigned to one of three groups; a control group, an in-person weight
      maintenance group and a maintenance group that meets over the Internet. This research project
      is being conducted in Vermont.
