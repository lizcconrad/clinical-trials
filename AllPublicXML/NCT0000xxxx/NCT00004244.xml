      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-12 and
      interferon alfa in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer or malignant melanoma.
      Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a
      person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the
      growth of cancer cells. Combining interleukin-12 and interferon alfa may kill more cancer
      cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa in patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of these drugs when concurrently administered in
      this patient population.

      III. Obtain preliminary data on the antitumor efficacy of this combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study, followed by a randomized study.

      Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) twice a week and interferon alfa SC three
      times a week every week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Once the MTD is established, additional patients are accrued and randomized to 1 of the
      following treatment arms:

      ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-12 SC twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by treatment
      with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above.

      ARM II: Patients receive interferon alfa SC three times a week for 2 weeks, followed by
      treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above.

      ARM III: Patients receive treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa
      at the MTD as described above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for the dose escalation portion
      of this study. An additional 18 patients (5 in arm I, 5 in arm II, and 8 in arm III) will be
      accrued to the randomized portion of this study.
