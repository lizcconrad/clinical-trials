      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give
      higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus peripheral stem
      cell transplantation in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify an antitumor effect of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation (PBSCT) in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      II. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of a nonmyeloablative, low intensity, preparative
      regimen followed by an HLA-matched allogeneic PBSCT in these patients.

      III. Monitor engraftment by measuring donor-recipient chimerism in lymphoid and myeloid
      lineages in these patients.

      IV. Investigate the relationship between donor-host chimerism and the incidence of acute and
      chronic graft-versus-host disease in this patient population.

      V. Investigate the effect of lymphocyte infusions on donor-host chimerism in this patient
      population.

      VI. Determine disease-free survival, overall survival, and mortality from the procedure or
      tumor progression in this patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of a conditioning regimen. Patients receive
      1 of 3 dose levels of chemotherapy prior to peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC)
      transplantation. Patients at dose level 1 receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7
      and -6 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1. Patients at dose level 2
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes
      daily on days -5 to -1, and antithymocyte globulin daily on days -5 to -2. Patients at dose
      level 3 receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -8 to -6, fludarabine IV over
      30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1, and antithymocyte globulin daily on days -5 to -2.

      Patients undergo mobilized CD34+ PBPC transplantation on day 0. PBPC transplantation may be
      repeated on days 1 and 2 if deemed necessary.

      Patients with progressive disease on days 15-30, day 60, or day 100, without
      graft-versus-host disease, receive infusion(s) of donor lymphocytes. Further donor lymphocyte
      infusions after day 100 may be given at the discretion of the attending physician.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for the next 2 years, and
      then every 6 months until year 5 posttransplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
