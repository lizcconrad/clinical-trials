      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of alpha-melanocyte
      stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in patients with acute renal failure.

      II. Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients at high risk of acute
      renal failure after renal transplantation.

      III. Determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of alpha-MSH in patients with established
      ischemic acute renal failure.

      IV. Determine the effect of alpha-MSH on interleukin-10 pharmacokinetics.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter
      study.

      Group 1: Patients are infused with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or
      placebo over 5 minutes. A cohort of 5 patients is infused at each dose level of alpha-MSH
      until the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are determined.

      Group 2: Patients receive a single dose of the MED of alpha-MSH IV over 5 minutes at the time
      anastomoses are complete. Other patients receive alpha-MSH at the MTD. Cohorts of 5 patients
      each are treated at the MED and the MTD.

      Group 3: Patients receive alpha-MSH as in group 2. Additional dose levels are also tested.
