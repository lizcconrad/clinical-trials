    <textblock>
      Participant with squamous cell cancer of head and neck are invited to participate in this
      study. In this study the investigators will be Inserting the gene for interleukin-12 into a
      person's cancer cells with the anticipation to make the body build an immune response to kill
      more tumor cells.

    <time_frame>Assessed during therapy up to 7 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD of IL-12 gene medicine is determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed in the two dose levels planned then evaluation of a third escalation will be considered. If the MTD is not reached, the dose selected for use in the phase II portion will be defined as the maximum volume that can be reasonably and safely injected into the tumor.</description>
