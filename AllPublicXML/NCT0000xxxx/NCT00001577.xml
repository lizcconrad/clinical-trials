    <textblock>
      Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone is administered as a double
      perfusion schedule.

      These two isolates limb perfusions with melphalan are treated 3-6 weeks apart. After
      perfusion is established, the leak rate has been determined to be acceptable, and tissue
      temperatures are 38 degrees Celsius, then the melphalan is administered by slow injection
      into an arterial line over approximately 5 minutes. The perfusion with melphalan will then
      continue for 60 minutes, after which the extremity is flushed out with a total of 3 liters of
      fluid consisting initially of a saline solution. The dose of melphalan for the second
      perfusion will be increased.

      An attempt to resect the residual lesion between 6-12 weeks after the second

      interval perfusion may be made.

      Patients with extremity melanoma (Stage IIIA, IIIAB or Stage IV disease who have bulky
      symptomatic tumor located in the extremity) or patients with unresectable extremity sarcoma
      will undergo a double isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone separated by approximately
      4 to 6 weeks. The initial perfusion will be done with a melphalan dose of 6 mg/L limb volume
      and the interval perfusion with a dose of 9 mg/L limb volume. For patients with extremity
      sarcoma the tumor will be excised if feasible using a limb sparing resection between 6-12
      weeks after the second perfusion. Technical feasibility of the double perfusion schedule will
      be determined. Overall response, duration of response, patterns of recurrence, and survival
      will be followed.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        Histologically confirmed unresectable sarcoma or intransit melanoma of the upper or lower
        extremity.

        Extremity sarcoma with no local resection option and would require amputation based upon
        abutment or proximity of the tumor to major neurovascular structures or bone or joint
        structures.

        MELANOMA PATIENTS:

        Must have history of two or more satellite intransit metastases of which one may be excised
        for diagnosis with the exception of patients with a single, large, deep, locally recurrent
        tumor or metastatic tumor (greater than 5 cm) that precludes an excision with primary
        closure. Stage IV melanoma must have a significant component (greater than 90%) of disease
        distal to the apex of the femoral triangle in the lower limb or distal to the insertion of
        the deltoid in the upper limb.

        Must have evaluable disease in the extremity. Melanoma must have dermal or subcutaneous
        lesion that can be measure directly in two diameters to assess tumor burden. Sarcoma must
        have either cutaneous lesions amenable to direct measurement or deeper lesions that can be
        measured on CT or MRI scans.

        PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY:

        At least 2 months since any regional therapy to the affected extremity.

        BIOLOGIC THERAPY: At least 1 month since Biologic Therapy.

        CHEMOTHERAPY: At least 1 month since chemotherapy.

        ENDOCRINE THERAPY: Not specified.

        RADIOTHERAPY: At least 1 month since radiotherapy.

        SURGERY: Not specified.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

        AGE: 18 and over.

        PERFORMANCE STATUS: ECOG 0-2.

        LIFE EXPECTANCY: At least 6 months.

        HEMATOPOIETIC: Platelet count greater than 150,000/mm(3).

        HEPATIC: Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL.

        RENAL: Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL.

        CARDIOVASCULAR: No history of congestive heart failure with an LVEF less than 40%.

        PULMONARY:

        No chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

        No other chronic pulmonary disease with PFTs less than 50% predicted for age.

        OTHER:

        IF HIV POSITIVE: Must have CD4 cell count greater than 500/mL and, No clinical
        manifestations of AIDS. Coagulation parameters no greater than 1-2 seconds within the upper
        limit of normal.

        No evidence of severe peripheral vascular disease.

        No history of claudication or other ischemic vascular disease.

        Not pregnant or nursing.
