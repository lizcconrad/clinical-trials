  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effects of two doses of synthetic peptide construction 3 ( SPC3 ) on HIV-1
      plasma levels (as measured by RNA PCR Amplicor) and on lymphocyte subsets in patients with
      initial viral load above 10,000 copies/ml. To study the safety of SPC3 and the kinetics of
      HIV-1 plasma level changes.

    <textblock>
      The first five patients receive SPC3 daily for 3 weeks. If that dose is tolerated, the dose
      is increased and given to the next 5 patients for 3 weeks. The remaining ten patients receive
      a dose of SPC3 based on response to the previous two dose levels. Patients are followed
      through day 28.

        FDA DISCLAIMER:

          -  The FDA encourages the inclusion of females of childbearing potential in study
             protocols, but the sponsor of this protocol specifically excludes females of

        Patients with the following conditions are excluded:

        Inability to communicate with investigator or deemed likely to be noncompliant on study.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any drug that may interact with SPC3 (e.g., suramin).

        Patients with the following prior condition are excluded:

        History of relevant drug hypersensitivity.
