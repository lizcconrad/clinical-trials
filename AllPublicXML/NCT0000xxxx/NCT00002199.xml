  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety, tolerance, early antiviral activity, and durability of antiviral
      response of the lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV)/1592U89 arm versus the 3TC/ZDV/indinavir
      (IDV) arm. To determine the effect of the two arms on clinical efficacy as determined by the
      occurrence of new CDC, defined class B/C events, survival, medical resource utilization, and
      the development of plasma viral genotypic and phenotypic resistance.

    <textblock>
      In this international study, 550 patients are randomized (225 per arm) to receive Combivir in
      combination with 1592U89 or indinavir. If after 16 weeks (and every 8 weeks thereafter until
      week 48) a patient has HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 400 copies/ml (by PCR on two occasions &gt;= 1 week and &lt; 4
      weeks apart), the patient has the option to switch to open-label therapy consisting of
      indinavir, 1592U89, and Combivir.
