      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients
      with recurrent or unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer that has been previously treated
      with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced, recurrent, or
      inoperable ovarian epithelial cancer treated with aminocamptothecin as second-line therapy.
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the
      topoisomerase-I levels with response in patients with accessible tumors treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable). (The
      measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective 08/1998.) Patients receive
      aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR)
      receive 4 additional courses past CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within approximately 15 months. (The measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective
      08/1998.)
