        Patients must have:

          -  Disseminated MAC as defined by current (within the last month) positive blood, bone
             marrow, or liver biopsy culture for MAC, and considered symptomatic (fever, night
             sweats, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, or malaise).

          -  At least 2 months of prior treatment with available combination MAC therapy or less
             than 2 months of such accompanied by unacceptable adverse effects.

          -  Consent of parent or guardian if under legal age of consent.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients who have completed acute treatment with azithromycin for MAC in protocol
             066-131 or 066-148 will be exempt from inclusion criteria 1 and 2 and can continue
             therapy through this protocol if their physician feels they have benefitted from prior
             azithromycin therapy.

          -  Inability to take oral medications or current condition that is likely to interfere
             with absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other MAC therapy instituted during the first 2 months of the study.

             IND program.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

        History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to azithromycin.
