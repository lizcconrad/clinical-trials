      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the clinical presentation of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.

      II. Identify the genetic mutations associated with this disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo a scrape biopsy acquisition of nasal cells for ciliary studies, a chest
      radiograph, sinus radiographs, lung function tests, sputum cultures, nitric oxide
      measurement, and an ear, nose and throat evaluation to screen for primary ciliary dyskinesia
      (PCD). Blood collection and/or a buccal scrape is also performed for genetic studies.

      Genetic studies include molecular linkage analyses, genetic mapping, and gene mutation
      identification based on large deletions. Microsatellite markers are used to identify
      polymorphism.

      Genetic counseling is provided to all participants.
