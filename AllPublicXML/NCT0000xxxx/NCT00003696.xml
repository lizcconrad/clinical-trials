      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is most effective for extensive-stage small
      cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effect of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide with carboplatin and
           paclitaxel on progression free survival in patients with extensive stage small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Compare the overall survival, response rate, duration of response, and toxic effects of
           these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to institute and
      performance status (0-1 vs 2-3).

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin IV on day 1, and etoposide
           IV on days 1-3 every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1
           every 3 weeks.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are treated for up to 5 courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued within 24
      months for this study.
