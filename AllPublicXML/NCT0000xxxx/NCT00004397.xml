      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effectiveness of tin mesoporphyrin in reducing the number of heme
      infusions needed to prevent acute attacks of porphyria.

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of tin mesoporphyrin in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an unblinded study. Patients start a preventive heme regimen and
      are followed for 6 months prior to tin mesoporphyrin. The frequency of attacks is recorded.

      Patients receive tin mesoporphyrin once a week for 6 months. Patients must avoid sunlight
      during treatment and for 2 months thereafter. The frequency of heme infusions is reduced by
      half and the frequency of attacks of porphyria is monitored.

      Patients are followed for 6 months after last treatment.
