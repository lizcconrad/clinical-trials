      This study tests the effects of social support and education on the health and well-being of
      people with fibromyalgia (FMS). We recruited 600 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of FMS
      from a large health maintenance organization. We randomly assigned the study participants to
      one of three groups. People in the social support group met with others who suffer from FMS
      for 2 hours every week for 10 weeks, and then monthly for an additional 10 months. The social
      support and education group also had 10 2-hour weekly meetings followed by 10 monthly
      meetings with others who suffer from FMS. Members of this group learned about the disease and
      ways they can manage it themselves. The third group participated only in the five assessment
      periods. The study lasted 4 years.

    <textblock>
      Next to osteoarthritis, FMS is the most common arthritis-related disease. Symptoms include
      musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, morning stiffness, and
      sleep disturbances. Fluctuating severity, pain, and frustration with the difficulty of
      diagnosis and treatment lead patients to continually seek help from health care
      professionals. There is no known cause or cure for this disease.

      This study tests the effects of social support and education on the health and well-being of
      people with fibromyalgia (FMS). We recruited 600 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of FMS
      from a large health maintenance organization. To be eligible, people had to meet the American
      College of Rheumatology guidelines for FMS. After we confirmed the diagnosis, we assigned
      those who agreed to participate to one of three groups. The first group (social support) met
      with others who suffer from FMS for 2 hours every week for 10 weeks, and then monthly for an
      additional 10 months. The second group (social support and education) also had 10 2-hour
      weekly meetings followed by 10 monthly meetings with others who suffer from FMS, and its
      members learned about the disease and self-management techniques. The third group (control)
      participated only in the five assessment periods. We assessed people in all three groups
      before we assigned them to a group, after the intervention, and at yearly follow-ups. The
      study duration was 4 years.
