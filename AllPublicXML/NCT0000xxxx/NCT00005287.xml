      To measure the cardiopulmonary function in individuals who developed bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD) at Stanford University Medical Center from 1964-1973 and to determine the
      factors associated with the presence of cardiopulmonary function abnormalities in these
      adolescents and young adults.

      BACKGROUND:

      Eleven to 22 percent of prematurely born human infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (RDS) treated with artificial ventilation and supplemental oxygen therapy, develop a severe
      chronic lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia. While many children who had BPD are
      asymptomatic by three years of age, some can have respiratory symptoms and abnormal pulmonary
      function tests at nine years of age. The hypothesis tested in this study is that
      abnormalities of pulmonary function seen in infants with BPD can persist into adolescence,
      even in asymptomatic children and young adults.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A detailed interval pulmonary history was taken. Pulmonary abnormalities were determined by
      pulmonary angiography and lateral chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests for small airway
      obstruction, reversible bronchial hyperreactivity, distribution of ventilation, air trapping
      and hyperinflation, residual interstitial disease or edema, vascular bed loss, and gas
      exchange. Right and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated by electrocardiogram.
      Elevated right ventricular pressure was estimated by echocardiography with doppler
      ultrasound. The atopic status of the children was determined. Other abnormalities, including
      growth retardation, developmental delay, hearing loss, retrolental fibroplasia, and
      neurologic disability seen in BPD were assessed by history and physical examination.
