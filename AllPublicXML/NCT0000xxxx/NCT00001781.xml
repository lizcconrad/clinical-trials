  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the nervous system. The exact cause of MS is unknown,
      but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions are diseases that
      cause the body's immune system and natural defenses to attack healthy cells. In the case of
      MS, the immune system begins attacking myelin, the cells that make up the sheath covering
      nerves. Without myelin nerves are unable to transmit signals effectively and symptoms occur.

      Researchers are interested in testing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of a new
      therapy (CGP77116) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). CGP77116 is a small protein similar to the
      protein in myelin. CGP77116 is designed to modify the immune reaction that destroys normal
      myelin. CGP77116 is an experimental therapy meaning it has not been approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration. However, in preliminary studies on animal it has been shown to be
      effective at modifying the autoimmune reaction associated with the development of MS.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effect of CGP77116 on disease activity
      in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      immunological studies.

      The study is broken into three parts:

      I) BASELINE: in the first part of the study patients will undergo 6 MRIs over a 5 month
      period. During this time, patients will be evaluated based on the presence of MS lesions seen
      on MRI. Patients whose MS lesions are highly active will be entered into the second part of
      the study.

      II) TREATMENT: in the second part of the study, patients with active MS lesions will begin
      receiving CGP77116. The drug will be given by injection once a week for one month and then
      once a month for 8 additional months.

      III) FOLLOW-UP: in the third and final part of the study, patients will undergo an MRI every
      2 months for 6 months and then every 3 months for 6 additional months. The results of the
      MRIs will be used to measure the effectiveness of CGP77116.

      This trial will evaluate safety, tolerability and effect on cranial magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and immune response of CGP 77116 in patients with the demyelinating autoimmune
      disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of the trial is to assess whether CGP 77116
      modifies inflammatory disease activity as measured by MRI and immunological techniques, and
      to facilitate dose selection for future pivotal trials in progressive and relapsing-remitting
      MS.

      CGP 77116 is an altered peptide ligand (APL) designed around an immunodominant epitope of
      human myelin basic protein (MBP) corresponding to amino acids 83-99, for the treatment of
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Substitution of a key T cell receptor contact residue with alanine
      results in a non-stimulatory peptide analogue. Recent evidence suggests that a T
      cell-mediated immune response against immunodominant myelin protein peptides such as MBP
      (83-99) is involved in MS pathogenesis (1). MS results when the immune system is unable to
      keep autoreactive T cells from entering the central nervous system where they initiate
      demyelination of myelin sheaths. By targeting MBP autoreactive T cells, CGP 77116 may
      downregulate the MBP-specific immune response and lead to amelioration of MS.
