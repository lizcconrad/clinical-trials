  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety, toxicity, and tolerance of two doses of ribavirin in combination with
      didanosine (ddI) to HIV-infected children. To determine the toxicity of ddI/ribavirin and
      compare it to the expected toxicity of ddI monotherapy. To determine the effect of concurrent
      ribavirin on the pharmacokinetics of ddI. To determine a dosage of ribavirin that would be
      suitable for a Phase II/III evaluation of ddI/ribavirin.

      Ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral agent, may enhance the antiretroviral activity of
      didanosine ( ddI ) without a concomitant increase in toxicity. Ribavirin alters the
      intracellular metabolism of ddI, enhancing the antiretroviral activity of the active form of
      ddI.

      Ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral agent, may enhance the antiretroviral activity of
      didanosine ( ddI ) without a concomitant increase in toxicity. Ribavirin alters the
      intracellular metabolism of ddI, enhancing the antiretroviral activity of the active form of
      ddI.

      Patients are divided into two cohorts. Subjects will be stratified by age 3 months to &lt; 24
      months and &gt;= 24 months to 12 years. Fifty % of patients from each age group will be assigned
      to each cohort. Cohort 1 receives ddI monotherapy for 4 weeks, followed by combination
      ddl/ribavirin therapy for an additional 20 weeks. Cohort 2 receives combination ddI/ribavirin
      for 24 weeks. In both cohorts, after study medications are stopped, patients are treated with
      prescription antiretrovirals for 4 more weeks. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/96: Note: In each cohort
      of 10 subjects at least 2 of 5 children from the older half of the cohort will have an ICD
      p24 antigen at entry.]
