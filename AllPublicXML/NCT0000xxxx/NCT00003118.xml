      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether surgery is more effective with or without chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy for cancer of the esophagus.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without
      combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have cancer of the
      esophagus that can be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare overall five-year survival rates and treatment failures in patients
      receiving neoadjuvant cisplatin (CDDP) plus fluorouracil (5-FU) with concomitant radiotherapy
      followed by surgical resection versus patients receiving surgery alone. II. Assess and
      compare the toxicities of each approach. III. Compare the incidence and pattern of local
      (gastric or esophageal bed or regional lymph nodes) and distant (supraclavicular lymph node,
      liver, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or lung, brain, etc.) recurrence. IV. Evaluate the
      prognostic ability of noninvasive and minimally invasive pretreatment staging with regard to
      survival and recurrence. V. Evaluate the ability of preresection adjuvant chemotherapy with
      concomitant radiation therapy to render tumors to lower stages. VI. Evaluate the impact of
      lymph nodes on survival and recurrence.

      OUTLINE: This a two arm, randomized study. Patients are stratified by: cell type of cancer
      (squamous cell vs adenocarcinoma); lymph nodes (positive vs negative); and stage (invasive vs
      noninvasive). Patients in arm I undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy within 24 hours of each
      other. Chemotherapy consists of cisplatin (CDDP) by bolus IV infusion over 30 minutes on day
      1 and again on day 29. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is administered by continuous IV infusion for 4
      days (on days 1-4 and 29-32) after completion of cisplatin. Radiotherapy is administered on
      days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33, with a boost on days 36-38. If there is no disease
      progression or unresectable disease, surgery is performed within 3-8 weeks following
      completion of therapy. Patients in arm II undergo surgery alone no later than 6 weeks
      postrandomization. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for two years, then every 6
      months for the next two years, and annually thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Patients with histologically documented untreated squamous cell carcinoma or
             adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (below 20 cm) or gastro-esophageal junction
             and with less than 2 cm distal spread into the gastric cardia were eligible.

          2. No evidence of distant metastatic disease by history and physical examination

          3. Upper endoscopy with biopsy, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and upper abdomen,
             and pulmonary function studies are required.

             value.

             stem bronchus.
