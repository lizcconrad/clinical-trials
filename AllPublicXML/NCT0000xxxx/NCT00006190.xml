  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is a major global health problem. Survival and quality of life for HIV subjects
      has tremendously improved with the advent of a class of antivirals called protease inhibitors
      and the utilization of highly active combination therapy. However, such therapy has been
      associated with a syndrome called lipodystrophy. This lipodystrophy syndrome causes body
      shape changes; typically thinning and loss of fat from the arms, legs and face, with
      increased fat appearing in the abdomen and neck. There are also metabolic changes which
      occur, and subjects can develop increased triglycerides, increased cholesterol and an
      increased risk for diabetes as indicated by increasing insulin resistance. This study will
      take HIV positive subjects who have not yet started antiviral medications (treatment
      naive)and randomly assign them to one of two treatment arms. These treatment arms will be:
      Sustiva/Zerit/Epivir vs. Viracept/Zerit/Epivir The subjects will be treated and followed for
      two years and have extensive metabolic testing, skinfold thickness measurements, MRI scans
      and other measures to determine if and how they are experiencing changes in metabolism or
      body shape and to discover the mechanism of why this occurs. Understanding the mechanism
      should allow researchers to design interventions for subjects who have lipodystrophy and
      strategies to prevent lipodystrophy from occurring to subjects treated with antivirals in the
      future.
