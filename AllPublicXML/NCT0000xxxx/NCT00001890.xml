  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease are much more common in men
      than in women. However, as women grow older, especially after menopause the incidence of
      atherosclerosis and heart disease increases. These findings suggest that estrogen may be
      protective and help in preventing heart disease.

      Studies of large groups of post-menopausal women suggest that hormone replacement therapy
      (therapy that includes estrogen) reduces the risk of heart disease. Estrogen causes favorable
      changes in particles that carry cholesterol in the blood stream and improves function of
      blood vessels. Estrogen may also stimulate the immune system's ability to fight off
      infections that may lead to or contribute to atherosclerosis.

      Researchers believe two specific infectious agents (Chlamydia pneumoniae and human
      cytomegalovirus) may cause damage to the lining of blood vessels resulting in inflammation
      and the development of atherosclerosis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if estrogen treatment can change how the immune
      system responds to chronic infections, by Chlamydia pneumoniae and human cytomegalovirus, in
      postmenopausal women.

      The incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in women does not approach rates seen
      in men until approximately a decade following menopause, suggesting that estrogen is
      vasculoprotective. Infectious pathogens such a Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) and human
      cytomegalovirus (hCMV) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
      Experimental studies in cultured lymphocytes and animals suggest that estrogen stimulates
      cell-mediated immune responsiveness, observations that are potentially relevant to the
      eradication of intracellular pathogens including C. pneumoniae and hCMV. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether estrogen therapy augments cell-mediated immune responsiveness
      in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women who have serologic evidence of chronic infection
      with C. pneumoniae and/or hCMV. A comparison will be made between seropositive and
      seronegative women. We propose that estrogen therapy will stimulate a more efficient
      cell-mediated response to these chronically persistent infectious intracellular pathogens,
      resulting in eradication of these organisms that are of potential importance in
      atherogenesis.
