      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of intravenous versus oral pulse loading of clomipramine (CMI)
      followed by a 12-week course of maintenance therapy in patients with obsessive compulsive
      disorder.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified by participating institution. Patients are randomized into one of two treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive a pulse loading dose of clomipramine (CMI) IV and an oral placebo on
      days 1 and 2.

      Arm II: Patients receive an oral pulse loading dose of CMI and an IV placebo on days 1 and 2.

      Patients receive maintenance therapy with daily oral CMI for 12 weeks beginning 4 days after
      pulse loading.
