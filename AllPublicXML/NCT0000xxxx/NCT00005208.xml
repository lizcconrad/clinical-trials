      BACKGROUND:

      Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is associated with increased fetal and neonatal
      morbidity and mortality possibly resulting from hypoxia in utero. The primary pathology of
      PIH involves a reduction in uteroplacental blood flow but modern imaging techniques have now
      shown that increased impedance of the fetal-placental circulation and hence reduced blood
      flow can also be found in PIH. This may represent a direct effect of hypoxia or be a fetal
      adaptation to increase placental oxygen extraction to relieve hypoxia. The fetal-placental
      circulation is regulated by humoral agents and vascular pressure. An imbalance of vasodilator
      prostacyclin (PGI2) and vasoconstrictor thromboxane (TxA2) production is reported to underlie
      the vasoconstriction seen in PIH.

      The study resulted from the 1986 release of a Request for Applications for Research on
      Hypertension in Pregnancy by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The fetal-placental circulations of perfused human placental cotyledons from normotensive and
      pregnancy-induced hypertensive pregnancies were used to determine if an imbalance in
      PGI2/TxA2 production existed and its relationship to the responses of the fetal-placental
      circulation to vasoconstriction. Studies were also conducted on the effects of hypocalcemia
      and hypomagnesemia, hypoxia, and drugs.
