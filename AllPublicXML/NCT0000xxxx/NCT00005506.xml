      BACKGROUND:

      This study meshed with a longitudinal case-control study, HL-35333, Carotid Atherosclerosis
      Follow-Up Study. HL-35333 comprised 280 individuals older than 45 equally divided between men
      and women, half with and half without CAD evaluated for risk factors at baseline and with
      completed follow-up with yearly B-mode for three years. The Carotid Atherosclerosis Follow-Up
      Study quantified the interassociations of angiographically defined coronary artery disease
      and CAD risk factors with progression. The NIH funded a continuation of this effort to review
      existing ultrasound tapes from this study in order to additionally evaluate the associations
      of all these factors with extracranial carotid arterial dimensions (ECAD: interadventitial
      and lumen diameters) and change in ECAD over time.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study assessed brachial artery reactivity among 100 CAD subjects and 100 controls who had
      been previously enrolled in a study of the relationship between extracranial intima media
      thickness (ECIMT) as assessed by B mode ultrasonographic measurements and CAD status. Most
      subjects had three consecutive B mode measurements at 12 month intervals. These subjects had
      brachial artery reactivity measurements according to a standardized protocol. Linear
      regression analysis was used to relate brachial artery reactivity to CAD status, gender and
      risk factors as predictors. Interaction effects were also assessed between CAD status and
      other risk factors and also between gender and other risk factors. Similar analyses were
      performed to relate percent dilation to ECIMT measurements.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
