  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of intravenous ganciclovir (also known as DHPG) in
      the treatment of sight-threatening cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. CMV
      retinitis is a severe vision-threatening viral infection of the retina of the eye. It occurs
      in patients whose immune function has been impaired and is the most common cause of blindness
      in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir (GCV) improved the signs and symptoms of CMV retinitis in
      approximately 80 percent of the patients treated for 2 weeks, but almost all of the patients
      treated with GCV had a relapse after treatment was stopped. Thus, it is important to
      determine if GCV can be safely given over a long period of time (maintenance therapy) and if
      it is effective in preventing a relapse of CMV retinitis.

      CMV retinitis is a severe vision-threatening viral infection of the retina of the eye. It
      occurs in patients whose immune function has been impaired and is the most common cause of
      blindness in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir (GCV) improved the signs and symptoms of CMV
      retinitis in approximately 80 percent of the patients treated for 2 weeks, but almost all of
      the patients treated with GCV had a relapse after treatment was stopped. Thus, it is
      important to determine if GCV can be safely given over a long period of time (maintenance
      therapy) and if it is effective in preventing a relapse of CMV retinitis.

      Patients are given GCV intravenously for 14 days. Then the patient receives the same dose,
      but only once a day, for as long as therapy is tolerated. If the retinitis worsens during the
      maintenance phase, the patient may again be given GCV for 14 days. Long-term treatment with
      GCV usually requires the surgical placement of a catheter in a large central vein in the
      chest or groin that is left in place indefinitely. If this is required, the procedure will be
      explained to the patient.
