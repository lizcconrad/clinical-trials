      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation using
      unrelated bone marrow donors in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the use of donors with a one non crossreactive group (CREG)
      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients less than 36 years of age is associated with more
      frequent graft versus host disease (GVHD) of grades III-IV than previously observed with
      donors with one CREG mismatch. II. Determine whether the use of donors with a one CREG
      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients 36-50 years of age is associated with more frequent GVHD
      of grades III-IV than previously observed with matched donors. III. Determine the relevance
      of HLA-A allele mismatching in bone marrow transplants from donors matched for HLA-A, B, and
      DR phenotypes.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel, open label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and total body
      irradiation (TBI) 3 times a day on days -4 through -1. Allogeneic bone marrow (ABM) is
      infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive therapy as in arm I, except TBI is administered
      twice a day on day -1 only. ABM is infused on day 0. Arm III: Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and TBI twice a day on days -3 through -1. ABM is
      infused on day 0. Males with ALL receive an additional radiation boost to the testes during
      TBI. Patients are followed at least every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients under 36 years old and 50 patients 36-50 years old
      will be accrued for this study within 5 years. Additional patients will be accrued for the
      standard therapy arm of this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Hematologic malignancies of the following types: Chronic
        myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase Newly diagnosed acute leukemia
        at high risk of relapse following chemotherapy alone Early referral encouraged so that
        donor search can begin as soon as possible Acute leukemia failing one cycle of induction
        chemotherapy Acute leukemia beyond first remission High-risk Hodgkin's disease and
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in first remission Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
        other malignant lymphoproliferative disease after first remission No suitable related donor
        available (i.e., no HLA genotypically identical sibling) No haploidentical relative with no
        more than 1 unshared haplotype for an HLA-A, -B, or -D locus Acute leukemia in relapse and
        CML in blast crisis eligible only under the following conditions: Patient's clinical
        condition is likely to remain stable for the 2-6 month period necessary to find a marrow
        donor Remission induction has been attempted Local physician and patient accept that the
        search or transplant may be canceled if the patient's condition deteriorates during the
        search No leukoencephalopathy Donor requirements: Age less than 60 In good health
        Phenotypically identical for HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 1-antigen mismatch for HLA-A, -B, or
        -DRB1 locus allowed for patients below age 36 Patients for whom TBI is contraindicated may
        be treated on protocol FHCRC-739 Severe aplastic anemia should be transplanted according to
        protocols FHCRC-174.2 or FHCRC-800 Myelodysplastic syndrome should be transplanted
        according to protocol FHCRC-179.3 or FHCRC-844

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Under 56 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy:
        Not specified Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: No acute hepatitis No other severe
        hepatic disease Renal: Creatinine less than 2 times normal for age, weight, and sex
        Cardiovascular: No symptomatic cardiac disease Pulmonary: No active pulmonary disease No
        history of pulmonary fibrosis No severe hypoxemia (pO2 less than 70 mm Hg and DLCO less
        than 70%) No mild hypoxemia (pO2 less than 80 mm Hg and DLCO less than 60%) Other: HIV
        negative No severe limitations due to diseases other than malignancy

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No more than 3,000 cGy to the whole brain No more than 1,500 cGy
        to the chest or abdomen At least 6 months since involved-field irradiation to the chest or
        abdomen
