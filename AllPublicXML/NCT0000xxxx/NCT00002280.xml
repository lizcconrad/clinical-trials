      The purpose of this study is to make didanosine (ddI) available to children with AIDS who are
      clinically deteriorating on zidovudine (AZT) or intolerant to AZT and cannot enter the Phase
      II ddI programs due to protocol exclusion or geographic location.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

          -  Concomitant medications for the treatment of complications of AIDS.

          -  CAUTION:

          -  Concomitant use of ddI with the following drugs must be done with extreme caution:

          -  Other nucleosides (e.g., ganciclovir).

          -  Drugs with toxicities similar to those observed with ddI (e.g., phenytoin).

          -  Drugs with significant pancreatic toxicities, including many drugs used for treatment
             of major opportunistic infections.

          -  Use of Sulfonamides or intravenous pentamidine for treatment of acute Pneumocystis
             carinii pneumonia (PCP) requires discontinuation of ddI for a week following treatment
             of PCP.

          -  Caution should also be exercised with patients having intractable diarrhea or patients
             following a low sodium diet.

        Patients must have the following:

        - Diagnosis of AIDS. Demonstrated either significant deterioration despite parenteral
        dosing with zidovudine (AZT) or significant intolerance to AZT.

        Signed informed consent by parent or legal guardian. Evaluations every 7-14 days while
        taking ddI for the first 4 months. Monthly follow-up is required thereafter.

        Excluded:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents.

          -  AVOID:

          -  Those agents that may cause pancreatitis such as:

          -  Antituberculosis drugs.

          -  Cimetidine.

          -  Ranitidine.
