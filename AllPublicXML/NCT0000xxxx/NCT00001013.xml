  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug therapy (trimetrexate plus
      leucovorin calcium) with that of conventional therapy (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) in the
      treatment of moderately severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients who have
      AIDS, are HIV positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      New treatments are needed to reduce the mortality rate from PCP in AIDS patients and to
      reduce the high relapse rate found after conventional therapy. Trimetrexate (TMTX) was chosen
      for this trial because it was found to be much more potent than sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
      (SMX/TMP) against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with
      leucovorin (LCV), did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial. It is believed that
      TMTX will be more effective than SMX/TMP in treating PCP and in preventing a recurrence of
      PCP. Preliminary studies suggest that aerosolized pentamidine (PEN) is likely to be effective
      in preventing a recurrence of PCP.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to TMTX / LCV or to SMX/TMP for a 21-day
      trial. For the first 10 days, the trial is double-blind (neither patient nor physician knows
      which drugs the patient is receiving), and drugs are given by intravenous infusion. TMTX is
      given once every 24 hours and LCV every 6 hours; SMX/TMP is given every 6 hours. Doses are
      determined by body size. After the first 10 days, LCV and SMX/TMP may be given orally. Doses
      are adjusted or treatment is changed to intravenous PEN if side effects are too severe.
      During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used because of possible increased bone
      marrow toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the patient's white cell count is acceptable.
      Aerosolized PEN therapy is begun 7 - 10 days after completion of therapy for the acute
      episode. PEN is inhaled once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 48 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Acetaminophen:

          -  650 mg prescribed as necessary for temperature &gt; 38.7 degrees C. Acetaminophen should
             not be prescribed as a standing order for more than 48 hours.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) as long as such therapy is suspended prior to randomization and not
             reinstituted until therapy for the acute episode is completed and the patient's white
             blood cell count is acceptable.

          -  Other myelosuppressive therapies which may be handled in the same manner as AZT.

          -  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

          -  Unequivocal diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) by morphologic
             confirmation of three or more typical P. carinii organisms in sputum, bronchoalveolar
             lavage fluid, or lung tissue obtained by transbronchial or open-lung biopsy within 3
             days before or after randomization. If morphologic confirmation is not possible prior
             to therapy, patients may be randomized if the investigator believes there is a high
             suspicion of PCP based on clinical presentation. If morphologic diagnosis cannot be
             established within 6 days of randomization, the patient will be withdrawn from study
             therapy. Resting (A-a) DO2 &lt; 30 torr on room air. Patient, parent, guardian, or person
             with power of attorney gives informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients will be excluded for the following reasons:

          -  History of Type I hypersensitivity (i.e., urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis),
             exfoliative dermatitis, or other life-threatening reaction secondary to antibiotics
             containing sulfa, trimethoprim, or trimetrexate.

          -  History of life-threatening pentamidine toxicity.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other drugs for the treatment or prevention of AIDS or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
             (PCP).

          -  Disalcid.

          -  Aspirin.

          -  Acetaminophen q4h as a standing order for more than 48 hours.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 14 days of study entry:

          -  Systemic steroids exceeding physiological replacement.

          -  Other investigational drugs including ganciclovir.

          -  Excluded within 6 weeks of study entry:

          -  Another antiprotozoal regimen for this episode for therapy of active Pneumocystis
             carinii pneumonia (PCP).

          -  Patients who are unable to have arterial blood gas analysis (ABG's) on room air.

          -  Patients for whom a liter of intravenous fluid (5 percent dextrose in water) per 24
             hours, which is required to maintain blinding, would be medically inadvisable.
