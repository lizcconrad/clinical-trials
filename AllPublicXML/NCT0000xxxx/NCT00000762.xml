  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and immunogenicity of gp160 (MicroGeneSys), rgp120/HIV-1MN
      (Genentech), and rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) and their adjuvants in HIV-infected children 1
      month to 18 years of age.

      The initiation of this immunotherapy trial will provide multiple benefits by assessing in
      asymptomatic HIV-infected children a therapy currently being tested in their adult
      counterparts, in the hope of forestalling the progression of HIV immunosuppression and
      clinical disease.

      The initiation of this immunotherapy trial will provide multiple benefits by assessing in
      asymptomatic HIV-infected children a therapy currently being tested in their adult
      counterparts, in the hope of forestalling the progression of HIV immunosuppression and
      clinical disease.

      Patients are randomized to receive one of three vaccines (9 patients/vaccine) or the adjuvant
      placebos (3 patients/vaccine). The vaccines will be studied at both low and high doses. When
      three of four patients at the low dose of a vaccine have received two immunizations without
      evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, dose escalation to the higher dose of that vaccine is
      initiated in subsequent patient cohorts, provided all low dose arms are filled. A total of
      six immunizations are given, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. Patients are followed for 24
      weeks after the last immunization.
