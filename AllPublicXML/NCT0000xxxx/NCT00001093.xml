  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if it is effective to give aggressive anti-HIV
      therapy to patients who have been infected recently with HIV.

      Many doctors recommend that patients who have recently been infected with HIV begin anti-HIV
      treatment as soon as possible. However, early HIV infection is not yet completely understood,
      so it is not known if this is the best approach. This study will look at the effects of
      beginning anti-HIV treatment during early HIV infection.

      Although many researchers have recommended initiation of aggressive antiretroviral therapy as
      soon as possible after HIV infection occurs, the tolerability and efficacy of this approach
      has not been systemically evaluated. Many features of primary HIV pathogenesis are
      incompletely understood. A more complete understanding of immune dynamics and viral
      pathogenesis during primary HIV infection is critical to determine optimal treatment
      intervention strategies. This study will evaluate the outcomes of potent antiretroviral
      therapy initiated at different stages of primary HIV infection.

      Thirty-six of the study patients are coenrolled to ACTG 371 or another treatment protocol.
      All study drug treatment and toxicity management is performed according to guidelines in
      these treatment protocols. An untreated cohort of 12 patients is also followed on this study.
      Patients are stratified at enrollment according to their stage of acute or early HIV
      infection. Patients are evaluated for virologic, immunologic, and clinical parameters for 96
      weeks. In addition, novel studies of source partner identification are proposed. An effort is
      made to determine the most likely source partner(s) for each study patient on the basis of
      patient recall of possible exposures. A separate study protocol will evaluate the source
      partner.
