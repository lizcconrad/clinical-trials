      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well temozolomide works in treating patients
      with progressive low-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the response rate in patients with progressive low-grade gliomas treated with
           temozolomide.

        -  Determine the activity of this drug, in terms of stabilizing growth of progressive
           low-grade gliomas, in adult patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (pilocytic astrocytoma, mixed glioma,
      well-differentiated oligodendroglioma, and nonbiopsied optic pathway glioma or pontine
      glioma).

      Patients receive temozolomide orally once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days. In
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue with
      treatment until tumor has remained stable for 12 courses.

      Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-100 patients (9-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
