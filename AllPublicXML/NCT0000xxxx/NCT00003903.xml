      RATIONALE: Assessing the effect of androgen suppression on bone loss in prostate cancer
      patients may improve the ability to plan treatment, may decrease the risk of fractures and
      bony pain, and may help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to determine the effect of androgen suppression on bone loss in
      patients who have prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the effect of androgen ablation on bone resorption in patients with or without
           bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior androgen ablation therapy (yes vs no) and
      metastatic disease (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo blood work and 24 hour urine collection on day 1 and at week 6-8. Patients
      who have received androgen ablation therapy and are found to have increased bone resorption
      undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.

      A comparison is made between androgen ablation therapy and bone resorption and if metastases
      are associated with the two.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
