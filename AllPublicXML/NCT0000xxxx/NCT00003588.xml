    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients with ovarian
      cancer that has not responded to previous treatment. Inserting the p53 gene into a person's
      cancer cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the cancer cells more
      sensitive to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of adenovirus p53 in patients with platinum- and
      paclitaxel-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Document the observed anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate the biological endpoints (e.g., induction of apoptosis, p53 expression) of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo laparoscopy for p53 assessment and catheter placement. Patients receive
      daily intraperitoneal injections of adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) for 5 days every 3 weeks.
      Treatment is repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated at each dose level of Ad-p53. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose
      limiting toxicity.
