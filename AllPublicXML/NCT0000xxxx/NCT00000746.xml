      Primary: To determine in healthy volunteers whether priming with a vaccinia HIV-1 gp160
      envelope gene recombinant vaccine (HIVAC-1e) followed by boosting with one of two subunit
      recombinant HIV-1 envelope vaccines (Env 2-3 and gp120) provides enhanced immunogenicity
      compared to vaccination with the gp120 subunit vaccine alone. (Per 10/01/92 amendment, boosts
      with VaxSyn (gp160) were eliminated.) To evaluate the immunogenicity of one versus two
      priming doses of HIVAC-1e prior to a boost with gp120. To compare the relative immunogenicity
      of the three subunit vaccines when administered as boosters.

      Secondary: To examine the safety of administering the individual subunit vaccines in
      combination with HIVAC-1e and the safety of administering the gp120 subunit vaccine alone.

      In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines, the evidence suggested that administration of
      a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune
      response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.

      In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines, the evidence suggested that administration of
      a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune
      response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.

      Seventy healthy volunteers are randomized to one of four groups. Groups A and D receive one
      initial immunization with HIVAC-1e followed by two boosts with subunit gp120 and Env 2-3,
      respectively, at months 8 and 12. Group B receives two immunizations with HIVAC-1e at months
      0 and 8 followed by a single boost with subunit gp120 at month 12. Group C receives three
      doses of subunit gp120 only at months 0, 8 and 12. (Per 10/01/92 amendment, boosts with
      VaxSyn (gp160) have been eliminated.) Subjects are followed for 18 months.
