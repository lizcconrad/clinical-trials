      To assess the tolerance and toxicity profile of deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) after multiple
      oral dosing for 16 weeks. To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of FLT after
      multiple oral doses. To assess the effect of FLT on immunologic and virologic markers of HIV
      infection (CD4+ lymphocyte count, p24 antigen, viremia) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related
      complex (ARC) after multiple oral dosing for 16 weeks.

          -  Long term therapy with either aspirin or probenecid.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Blood transfusion more than once per month.

        Patients with the following are excluded:
