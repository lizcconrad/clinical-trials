      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) in patients
      with congenital lactic acidemia.

      II. Determine the efficacy of DCA in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of acute
      episodes of acidotic illness, improving linear growth, improving neurological or
      developmental function, or slowing neurological or developmental deterioration in these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, cross over study. Patients are
      randomized to start with one of two different doses of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA).

      Patients receive one of two doses of oral DCA for 6 months, then switch to the alternate dose
      for 6 months. This course is repeated once.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.
