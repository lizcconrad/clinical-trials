      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer
      cells. Biomed 101 may protect normal cells from the side effects of interleukin-2.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of Biomed 101 in treating patients
      receiving interleukin-2 for kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose of Biomed 101 in patients with
      renal cell cancer currently treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). II. Evaluate the effect of
      different doses of Biomed 101 on the incidence and severity of IL-2 related toxicities and on
      the incidence and frequency of IL-2 dose reduction due to IL-2 induced toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of Biomed 101. Patients receive oral Biomed 101
      three times daily, followed by interleukin-2 IV on days 1-5 and 16-20. Cohorts of 5 patients
      receive escalating doses of Biomed 101 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
