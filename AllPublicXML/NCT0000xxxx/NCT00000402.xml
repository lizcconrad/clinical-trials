  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We originally suggested that calcium in the diet is important in determining the amount of
      bone (bone mass) that builds up in young adults. We are testing the effect of calcium on bone
      mass in 354 Caucasian (white) girls. At the start of this 7-year study, the average age of
      the girls was 11 years, and they had not yet reached puberty. The study will also provide
      information about the effect of calcium on body composition (body fat) and blood pressure in
      young women.

      We have been giving calcium to one group of participants in this study and giving a placebo
      (an inactive pill, or &quot;sugar pill&quot;) to the other group. The results of this research will be
      important in preventing osteoporosis, because building more bone as a young person should
      reduce a woman's chances of developing osteoporosis later in life.

      This study evaluates the effect of calcium on bone mass accretion over 7 years in a cohort of
      354 young females who were in pubertal Stage II at the start of the study. The average age of
      study participants at entry was 11 years; at the end of the study participants were 18 years
      old.

      The study looks at skeletal development under the influence of heredity, nutrition (calcium),
      and physical exercise. We gave calcium to participants in one arm of this clinical trial
      calcium. Participants in the other arm of the trial were given a placebo. The main outcome
      variable is the bone mass measured at different skeletal regions.

      The study will also provide data about the efficacy of calcium supplementation with regard to
      hypertension prevention and obesity. The results of this research will be important in
      preventing osteoporosis.
