      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 plus fludarabine in
      treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or relapsed, indolent non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of bryostatin 1 and fludarabine
           in patients with symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia or relapsed
           indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Monitor apoptosis, differentiation, and protein kinase C activity in leukemic
           lymphocytes exposed in vivo to bryostatin 1 and fludarabine.

        -  Observe the antitumor activity of this combination therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to one of two
      treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours followed by fludarabine IV over
           30 minutes daily on days 1-5.

        -  Group II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 followed by
           bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 4 weeks for patients with stable or responding disease.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine and bryostatin 1 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for fludarabine is
      determined, the dose of bryostatin 1 is escalated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
