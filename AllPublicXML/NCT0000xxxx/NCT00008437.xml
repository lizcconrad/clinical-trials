      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as MRI, may allow the doctor to better detect the tumor.
      Highly focused ultrasound energy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating the breast tumor
      cells without affecting the surrounding tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of MRI-guided ultrasound energy in
      treating women who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events during and after MRI-guided
           focused ultrasound ablation in women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer.

        -  Determine the ability to accurately and thoroughly coagulate a target volume of breast
           carcinoma, in terms of real-time target volume temperature profile, follow-up MRI, and
           histology, using this procedure.

        -  Compare the appearance of gross and microscopic histopathologic tissue post coagulation
           with the pre- and post-coagulation magnetic resonance appearance of the targeted volume
           and measure any residual cancer cells in patients after this procedure.

        -  Determine patient acceptance of this procedure, in terms of positioning, pain, safety,
           and follow-up cosmesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation of the breast lesion using a
      series of pulses. Within 72 hours after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI to evaluate ablation borders. Within 7-10 days after MRgFUS
      procedure, patients undergo an ultrasound exam. Guide wires may be placed to assist in
      pre-surgical lesion localization. Within 10-21 days after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo
      segmental resection or mastectomy.

      Patients are followed at 5-10 days post-surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
