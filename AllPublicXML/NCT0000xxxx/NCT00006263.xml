      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's
      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin, temozolomide,
      and filgrastim in treating patients who have newly diagnosed or recurrent high-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma treated
           with temozolomide, carboplatin, and filgrastim (G-CSF).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease category
      (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs several other high-grade mixed
      gliomas).

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-2; oral temozolomide every 12 hours on
      days 1-5; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV daily starting no earlier than day 7
      and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102-222 (17-37 per each of 6 strata) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
