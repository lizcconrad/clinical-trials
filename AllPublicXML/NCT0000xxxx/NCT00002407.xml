      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give one of three
      different triple-drug combinations to HIV-infected patients who have never been treated with
      anti-HIV drugs.

      In this open-label, strategic study patients are evaluated at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 to Week
      48 after being treated on one of the following regimens:

      Stavudine (d4T) + Didanosine (ddI) + Lamivudine (3TC) or d4T + ddI + Indinavir or d4T + ddI +
      Nevirapine.
