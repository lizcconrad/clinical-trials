  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy with aerosolized pentamidine (PEN)
      with that of conventional therapy, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in the
      treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients who have AIDS, are HIV
      positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection.

      New treatments are needed for PCP, a common lung infection in patients with AIDS, because
      many patients treated with the two standard treatments, PEN given by injections and SMX/TMP,
      have had adverse effects that required a change in treatment. There is also a high relapse
      rate after the standard treatments. Preliminary experiments in humans suggest that
      aerosolized PEN is as effective as the standard treatments for PCP, and causes few adverse
      effects.

      New treatments are needed for PCP, a common lung infection in patients with AIDS, because
      many patients treated with the two standard treatments, PEN given by injections and SMX/TMP,
      have had adverse effects that required a change in treatment. There is also a high relapse
      rate after the standard treatments. Preliminary experiments in humans suggest that
      aerosolized PEN is as effective as the standard treatments for PCP, and causes few adverse
      effects.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to aerosolized PEN or to intravenous
      SMX/TMP, for a 21-day trial. SMX/TMP is given 4 times a day and aerosolized PEN once a day.
      Doses are determined by body size. Patients who receive aerosolized PEN also receive a
      placebo intravenous injection and patients who receive SMX/TMP also receive a placebo
      aerosol. Patients are hospitalized at least 5 days. Patients who improve may be discharged
      after 5 days at the discretion of the attending physician. Discharged patients continue the
      study with oral SMX/TMP and aerosolized placebo or aerosolized PEN and oral placebo. Patients
      who fail to respond or who develop severe adverse effects are switched to intravenous PEN or
      other standard therapy. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used. AZT may be
      resumed after therapy for the acute PCP episode is completed.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT), but must be suspended during study medication.

        Unequivocal diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia established by morphologic
        confirmation of three or more typical Pneumocystis carinii organisms in sputum,
        bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung tissue obtained by transbronchial or open-lung biopsy
        within 3 days before or after randomization. If morphologic confirmation is not possible
        prior to therapy, patients may be randomized if the investigator believes there is a high
        suspicion of PCP based on clinical presentation. If morphologic diagnosis cannot be
        established within 5 days of randomization, the patient will be withdrawn from study
        therapy. Resting (A-a) DO2 less than 30 torr on room air at all ACTG sites except San
        Francisco General Hospital. Non-ACTG sites will enter patients up to a resting (A-a)
        DO2less than 55 mmHg on room air.
