  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Specialized radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation
      directly to the tumor which may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and
      specialized high-dose radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the probability of overall survival and local control in patients with
           favorable prognosis, unresectable stage II-IIIA/B non-small cell lung cancer receiving
           paclitaxel and carboplatin plus 3-D conformal hyperfractionation radiotherapy (3D-CHRT).

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of nonhematologic toxicity, specifically
           esophagitis and pneumonitis, during 3D-CHRT and chemotherapy with paclitaxel and
           carboplatin in these patients.

        -  Correlate complication rate with radiation based on the effective dose to determine safe
           treatment guidelines.

        -  Determine the feasibility of patient-specific dose escalation using this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life and symptom distress in these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-D conformal hyperfractionated radiotherapy
      (3D-CHRT).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes weekly for 6-8 weeks. Patients undergo 3D-CHRT twice daily five days a week for 6-8
      weeks.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of 3D-CHRT in 4 dose levels.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to study, weekly during chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and
      at 3 and 6 months.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-72 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
