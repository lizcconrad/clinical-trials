      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine and
      O6-benzylguanine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with
      recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma
      resistant to nitrosourea. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by
      carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
