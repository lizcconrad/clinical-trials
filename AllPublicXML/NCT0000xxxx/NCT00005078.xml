      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining tirapazamine, carboplatin, and
      paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced malignant solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tirapazamine in combination with carboplatin and
           paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors who have or have not received prior
           chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Investigate potential predictors of response by studying patient tissue specimens after
           receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tirapazamine. Patients are stratified according
      to prior chemotherapy status (previously untreated vs previously treated).

      Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Some patients may continue therapy in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients in the previously
      untreated stratum are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed indefinitely.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-68 patients (18-34 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 12-18 months.
