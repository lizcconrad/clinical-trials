  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define the safety of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from sibling-supplied
      dendritic cells and lymphocytes and infused into an HIV-infected patient. To determine the
      efficacy of these CTLs in helping the immune system to fight HIV.

      With lower CD4 counts, HIV-infected patients may not be able to produce dendritic cells and
      lymphocytes, special types of immune cells that generate HIV-specific CTLs. Infusion of CTLs
      generated from the dendritic cells and lymphocytes of an HIV-negative sibling may enable the
      body to recognize HIV more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

      With lower CD4 counts, HIV-infected patients may not be able to produce dendritic cells and
      lymphocytes, special types of immune cells that generate HIV-specific CTLs. Infusion of CTLs
      generated from the dendritic cells and lymphocytes of an HIV-negative sibling may enable the
      body to recognize HIV more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

      Dendritic cells and lymphocytes are obtained from an HIV-negative sibling. HIV-specific CTLs
      are generated from these cells and then infused into the HIV-infected patient monthly for 6
      months. Siblings must be able to donate on multiple occasions, and patients are followed
      every 2-4 weeks during the study. Patients are screened over 3 months prior to study entry.
