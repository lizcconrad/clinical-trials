      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. White
      blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients who have hematologic
      cancer that has recurred following bone marrow transplantation.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus infusion
      of donated white blood cells in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has
      recurred after bone marrow transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome when combined with
           etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusion with or without
           interleukin-2 after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with relapsed or
           persistent aggressive hematologic malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a partially randomized, dose-escalation study of doxorubicin HCl liposome
      (LipoDox).

      Patients enter 1 of 4 cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1: Three to six patients receive induction comprising etoposide IV over 1 hour on
           days 1-3, cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 8, and allogeneic donor lymphocyte
           infusion on day 10. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) or IV daily
           beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Cohort 2: In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on cohort 1, 3-6 patients
           receive treatment as in cohort 1 and LipoDox IV over 2 hours on day 1.

        -  Cohort 3: In the absence of DLT on cohort 2, 3-6 patients are randomized to 1 of 2
           treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment as in cohort 1 plus a higher dose of LipoDox IV
                over 2 hours on day 1.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in cohort 1 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC on
                days 10-12.

      If DLT is reached on cohort 2, 3-6 patients receive treatment as in arm II.

        -  Cohort 4: In the absence of DLT on arms I and II, patients receive treatment as in
           cohort 1, LipoDox as in arm I, and IL-2 as in arm II.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LipoDox until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
