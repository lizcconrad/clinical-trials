      RATIONALE: Chemotherapy uses different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gallium nitrate in treating patients
      with AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with
      AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate after failure on first-line
      chemotherapy regimen. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in
      these patients, and determine if there is a correlation between those parameters and
      response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium nitrate IV continuously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
      complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Patients who relapse after
      achieving CR may be retreated in the absence of disease progression. Treatment for relapse
      after a second CR is at the discretion of the principal investigator. Patients with
      leptomeningeal disease at study entry must receive intrathecal (IT) methotrexate with IV
      leucovorin calcium or IT cytarabine. Patients who develop leptomeningeal disease while on
      study may continue treatment with gallium nitrate but must also receive IT methotrexate and
      leucovorin calcium (with or without radiotherapy) or IT cytarabine. Patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage I-IV AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma Intermediate- or high-grade disease HIV infection documented by ELISA and
        confirmed by Western blot Must have received at least 1 potentially curative chemotherapy
        regimen for lymphoma Must be past the hematologic nadir resulting from prior chemotherapy
        (generally 2 weeks from onset of prior therapy regardless of filgrastim (G-CSF) use)
        Waiting period waived at the discretion of the principal investigator if patient well-being
        would be compromised At least 1 site of bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease
        (e.g., bone marrow involvement only) History of leptomeningeal disease associated with
        systemic lymphoma allowed No primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma A new classification scheme
        for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or
        &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or
        &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
