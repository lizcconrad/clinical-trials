  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innate immunity plays an important role for fungal recognition and initiation of fungicidal
      activity. We hypothesize that subtle differences in different molecules of innate immunity
      may contribute to either the predisposition or clinical course of infection with Cryptococcus
      neoformans. To test this hypothesis, we propose to analyze the allelic frequencies of 15
      different genes (mannose binding lectin, Fc-gamma receptor IIa and IIb, Fc-gamma receptors
      IIIa and IIIb, myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta, interleukin 1A and 1B,
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, NRAMP-1, chitotriosidase, and chemokine
      receptor 5) and their intragenic polymorphic forms and to compare this data to the incidence
      and severity of C neoformans infection. With this study we hope to identify a group of
      molecules of innate immunity which influence the risk and severity of invasive C neoformans
      infection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans infection will be identified from a data
        base overseen by Dr. Peter Pappas.

        Only patients diagnosed and treated in the United States and Canada will be included in
        this analysis.

        Only patients who are not coinfected with HIV will be included in the study.

        Patient samples will be collected and clinical data will be evaluated only after signed
