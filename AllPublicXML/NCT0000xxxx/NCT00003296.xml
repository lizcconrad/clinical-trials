      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating
      patients with liver or bile duct cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and toxicity of doxorubicin HCl liposome in
      patients with carcinomas of the liver and bile ducts.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 15 minutes every 21 days.
      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously starting on day 2 and continuing for 10-14
      days. Disease is restaged after every 3 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the
      first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-26 evaluable patients accrued into this study.
