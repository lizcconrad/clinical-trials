  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the effectiveness of subcutaneous gamma interferon in reducing severity of
      Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare (MAI) bacillemia episodes in AIDS patients in an
      open-label dose-randomized multi-center pilot clinical investigation. To evaluate the safety
      of gamma interferon given by subcutaneous injection (SC) in the AIDS patient in the presence
      and absence of AZT therapy.
