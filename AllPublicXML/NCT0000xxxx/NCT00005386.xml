      BACKGROUND:

      Behavioral medicine surveys consistently find that obesity is a treatment-resistant disease
      that continues to be a significant health problem and that the incidence of obesity is much
      higher in Blacks relative to whites in general, and even higher in Black women relative to
      white women. In fact, an NIH Program Announcement (PA-91-99), stated that &quot;Obesity in adults
      has not declined in the past three decades&quot; and &quot;Obesity is particularly prevalent in
      minority populations, especially among minority women.&quot; Obesity is an independent risk factor
      for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and hypertension. Obesity is a complex phenomenon
      involving behavioral, lifestyle, and complex biobehavioral mechanisms. In 1995, there were no
      prospective studies that simultaneously evaluated a systematic set of psychosocial variables
      with energy balance (dietary intake, physical activity, resting metabolic rate) determinants
      that may account for the increased risk for obesity in African-American versus Euro-American
      women.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      After subjects were recruited, psychosocial and energy balance (dietary intake, physical
      activity, metabolic rate) baseline measures were related to levels of body fat as measured by
      DEXA (dual electron X-ray absorptiometry). The role of these variables were evaluated
      prospectively to adiposity changes in both white and Black women over a 24-month period.
