  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow transplants (BMT) are one form of treatment for disorders of the blood, including
      leukemia. However, because the procedure is often associated with potentially
      life-threatening reactions, it is usually reserved for patients with serious illnesses under
      the age of 60 years old.

      One serious reaction complicating bone marrow transplants is referred to as graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). GVHD is a potentially fatal incompatibility reaction. The reaction is caused
      by antigens found on the cells of the patient that are not present on the cells of the donor.
      The antigens are recognized by transplanted white blood cells (lymphocytes). These
      lymphocytes begin attacking the recipient s cells and tissues and may lead to death.

      In order to avoid GVHD, researchers have developed a technique using peripheral blood instead
      of bone marrow that allows transplantation of stem cells and removal of lymphocytes. Stem
      cells are the cells responsible for returning blood cell production to normal. Lymphocytes
      are the white blood cells that can cause GVHD.

      The technique requires two steps. In the first step blood cells are collected from donors who
      have received doses of a growth factor. The growth factor (granulocyte colony stimulating
      factor) is designed to increase the production of donor stem cells.

      In the second step white blood cell lymphocytes are removed from the collected blood, leaving
      only the stem cells.

      The main goal of this study is to develop and improve the method of processing cells that are
      collected after stimulation with growth factor (G-CSF), by removing the white blood cell
      lymphocytes which can cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while keeping the stem cells
      necessary for healthy blood cell building. In addition, researchers are interested in
      studying whether giving G-CSF has an effect on lymphocyte function, which may influence the
      immune reactions occurring in bone marrow transplantation.

      The NHLBI Hematology Branch Stem Cell Transplantation program is exploring ways to make
      allogeneic transplantation safer and more widely applicable. Prior Hematology Branch
      transplant protocols have evaluated the strategy of using T cell depleted marrow transplants
      followed by delayed lymphocyte add-back to control or prevent GVHD while conserving useful
      donor immune function against residual leukemia and infectious agents. Over the past ten
      years, a number of increasingly efficient methods have been used to deplete T cells but
      retain stem cells, and we have shown the safety and utility of the delayed T cell add-back
      approach. We have also found a positive relationship between administration of higher CD34+
      cell doses and outcome. Investigation of highly purified grafts with add-back of specific T
      cell populations is ongoing, and the ability to test new purification approaches and devices
      on clinical-scale PBSC products is critical to the continued development of new
      transplantation approaches in our program. This requires testing the approaches on G-CSF
      mobilized PBSCs collected by apheresis from healthy donors, since this is the cell source
      that will be used in all clinical allogeneic transplantation protocols in our program.

      Therefore, the primary intent of this protocol is to provide a mechanism for mobilizing,
      collecting, storing, and analyzing G-CSF mobilized apheresis samples from healthy volunteers.
      Cells will be used to develop a method of processing the cells that are collected after
      stimulation with G-CSF, by removing the lymphocytes, which can mediate GVHD while retaining
      the stem cells which are necessary for hematopoietic reconstitution. At the same time we will
      study whether G-CSF administration has an effect on the lymphocyte, function which may
      influence the immune reactions occurring in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
      Furthermore the CD34+ cells collected will be a valuable resource for experimental studies of
      lymphocyte-stem cell interactions in our laboratory.
