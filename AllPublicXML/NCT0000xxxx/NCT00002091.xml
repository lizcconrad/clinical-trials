  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To determine whether pentoxifylline changes the self-reported measures of quality of
      life status, using measures of scores from double-blinded drug withdrawal and drug restart
      periods.

      SECONDARY: To measure the changes in monthly CD4 counts, fasting serum triglyceride levels,
      and weight; to assess the safety of pentoxifylline in HIV-infected persons.

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Evidence of active opportunistic infection or malignancy requiring high-dose systemic
