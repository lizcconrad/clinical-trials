      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole and ketoconazole in treating
      patients with advanced cancers. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more
      tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) in combination with
      ketoconazole in patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. Evaluate the toxic effects, safety, and efficacy of CAI in combination with ketoconazole.

      III. Determine the modulatory effects of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetic profile of CAI.

      IV. Determine a pharmacodynamic model for CAI and ketoconazole with respect to potential
      gastrointestinal, hematologic, and neurotoxicities.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) as a test dose on day 1. Patients receive
      oral ketoconazole on day 7, followed by CAI plus ketoconazole on day 8. CAI and ketoconazole
      are administered in combination on day 1 and days 3-28 of the first course. Ketoconazole is
      administered alone on day 2 of the first course. Subsequent courses begin at 28 day intervals
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Cohorts of 3 patients
      are evaluated at each dose level prior to dose escalation. If one of three patients within a
      cohort experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), that dose level is expanded to incorporate
      six patients. If two or more patients experience DLT, the next lower dose is declared to be
      the maximum tolerated dose.
