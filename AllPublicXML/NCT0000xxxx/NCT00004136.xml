      RATIONALE: Heating tumors to several degrees above body temperature may kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of heat therapy in treating patients who
      have unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in patients with primary or
      metastatic liver cancer. II. Determine disease free survival, local recurrence rate in
      treated lesions as compared to known recurrence rates after hepatic cryoablation, and overall
      survival in this patient population receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo laparoscopic or open laparotomy surgical procedure to identify
      unresectable tumors by ultrasound. Tumors are heated to a target temperature by electrodes
      for a maximum of 20 minutes. To achieve a 1 cm margin of ablated tissue around each lesion,
      multiple ablation courses may be performed, depending on the size of the lesions and the time
      required to complete the treatment. Patients may be retreated if tumor recurs or new disease
      appears. Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6
      months for next 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 59 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of unresectable malignant primary or metastatic liver
        tumors Tumors are deemed unresectable based on the following factors: 1-10 liver tumors
        Bilobar liver tumors Location of 1 or more lesions near a major intrahepatic vascular
        structure (hepatic vein, portal vein, vena cava) Severe cirrhosis to preclude a major liver
        resection No unresectable extrahepatic disease Prior failure of other therapeutic
        modalities allowed No more than moderate ascites No hepatic encephalopathy
