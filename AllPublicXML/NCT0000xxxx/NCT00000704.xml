  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (
      zalcitabine; ddC ) in treating patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex ( ARC ).

      Recent studies show that a certain group of drugs (dideoxynucleosides) are effective in
      treating patients with HIV infection. ddC is a dideoxynucleoside and test tube studies show
      that it may be valuable in treating AIDS patients. ddC has been shown to be well tolerated in
      certain patients with AIDS.

      Recent studies show that a certain group of drugs (dideoxynucleosides) are effective in
      treating patients with HIV infection. ddC is a dideoxynucleoside and test tube studies show
      that it may be valuable in treating AIDS patients. ddC has been shown to be well tolerated in
      certain patients with AIDS.

      A range of doses of ddC is given to patients with AIDS and ARC. Eight patients with AIDS and
      eight patients with ARC are given ddC at the lowest level for 12 weeks. Patients who respond
      with a rise in their number of T4 cells or with a fall in HIV antigen in their serum (the
      fluid portion of the blood) are continued at that dose for an additional 12 weeks. Patients
      who do not respond at a given dose level (no rise in T4 or fall in serum HIV antigen) stop
      treatment at 12 weeks. All patients are followed off therapy for 4 weeks. As each dose level
      is found to be well tolerated for 10 weeks in five of the eight patients in each group,
      additional patients will be entered at higher dose levels until eight AIDS and eight ARC
      patients are receiving the drug at a given level.
