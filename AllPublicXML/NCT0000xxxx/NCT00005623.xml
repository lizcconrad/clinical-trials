      RATIONALE: Cyproterone acetate may be effective treatment for hot flashes following surgical
      or chemical castration for prostate cancer. It is not yet known which regimen of cyproterone
      acetate is more effective for hot flashes.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of cyproterone acetate in
      treating patients who have hot flashes following surgical or chemical castration for prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of cyproterone acetate in patients with hot flashes following
           bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration for prostate cancer.

        -  Compare the effectiveness of two doses of cyproterone acetate in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.

      Patients receive one of two doses of oral cyproterone acetate or placebo for 12 weeks,
      followed by a 6-9 month open label extension period with all patients receiving cyproterone
      acetate.

      Quality of life is assessed.
