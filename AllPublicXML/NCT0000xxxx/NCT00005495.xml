      To evaluate the effectiveness of primary prevention of coronary heart disease risk factors by
      examining data from the National Health Examination Survey (NHES) and the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to determine whether more recent birth cohorts were
      attaining lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels than earlier birth cohorts.

      BACKGROUND:

      The coronary heart disease risk factor profile of Americans has been improving, with
      decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, it is not apparent whether this
      improvement is due to primary prevention of risk factors through lifestyle choices or to
      secondary prevention (management) of established risk factors. Since secondary prevention
      only targets people with high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, the effect should be
      demonstrated by temporal declines in the upper percentiles (75th, 90th) of the blood pressure
      and cholesterol distributions. Primary prevention should shift the entire risk factor
      distribution, including the percentiles in the middle (50th) and lower (10th, 25th) portions
      of the distribution. Thus, the effectiveness of primary prevention programs can be evaluated
      by examining temporal changes in the middle and lower percentiles, and the effectiveness of
      secondary prevention can be evaluated by examining temporal changes in the higher
      percentiles.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data from the National Health Examination Survey and the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Surveys were examined to determine whether more recent birth cohorts were
      attaining lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels than earlier birth cohorts. The results
      of these analyses provided information that may help guide further research and application
      of population prevention strategies.
