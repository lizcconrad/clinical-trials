      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells
      and slow the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is not yet known whether combining more
      than one chemotherapy drug with interferon alfa is more effective than chemotherapy alone in
      treating patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      with or without interferon alfa in treating patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the remission induction rates and toxicity of chlorambucil plus
      dexamethasone with or without idarubicin in patients with stage II-IV low grade non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Assess the additional value of a period of consolidation/maintenance treatment
      utilizing low dose interferon alfa or standard dose interferon alfa versus no further
      treatment in relationship to the duration of event-free survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized into one of two arms for induction chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days, oral idarubicin daily for 3
      consecutive days, and oral dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.
      Arm II: Patients receive oral chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days and oral
      dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. Treatment for both arms
      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After 6 courses of chemotherapy, patients are reassessed. If they have achieved maximal
      complete response or good partial response, patients are randomized into one of three arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment until disease progresses. Arm II: Patients
      receive low dose interferon alfa subcutaneously three times per week for a maximum of 3 years
      in the absence of disease progression. Arm III: Patients receive standard dose interferon
      alfa subcutaneously three times a week for a maximum of 3 years in the absence of disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 200 patients accrued into this study with approximately 150
      patients entering the second phase of this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed B cell low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
        Stage II, III or IV Measurable disease No chronic lymphatic leukemia, prolymphocytic
        leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, mycosis fungoides,
        Sezary's syndrome and T-zone lymphoma, plasmacytoma, T cell lymphomas, or centroblastic
        lymphoma No CNS disease A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has
        been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace
        the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this
        protocol uses the former terminology.
