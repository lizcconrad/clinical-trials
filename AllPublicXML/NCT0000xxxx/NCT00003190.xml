  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or
      without PSC 833 followed by interleukin-2 or no further therapy in treating older patients
      who have acute myeloid leukemia. Some cancers become resistant to chemotherapy drugs.
      Combining PSC 833 with more than one chemotherapy drug may reduce resistance to the drugs and
      allow the cancer cells to be killed. Combining interleukin-2 with combination chemotherapy
      plus PSC 833 may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of PSC-833 to induction chemotherapy improves complete
      response rates and whether the addition of PSC-833 to induction and consolidation
      chemotherapy improves survival for patients with AML &gt;= 60 years.

      II. To determine whether the administration of low-dose, subcutaneous rIL-2 immunotherapy
      with intermittent high-dose boluses after chemotherapy prolongs disease-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a partially randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to participating center and disease characteristics (de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      versus AML with antecedent myelodysplasia). Patients are randomized to one of two maintenance
      therapy arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 7 days and daunorubicin IV bolus
      followed by etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3.

      Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I with the addition of PSC 833 induction. A
      loading dose of PSC 833 IV is given over 2 hours, followed by a 74-hour continuous infusion
      of PSC 833 beginning 2 hours before daunorubicin and etoposide. Patients may receive a second
      induction course if residual leukemia is present in the bone marrow. Patients who experience
      a complete remission (CR) and meet certain other criteria receive postremission chemotherapy
      consisting of cytarabine IV continuously over 5 days plus daunorubicin IV followed by
      etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2. Patients who are randomized to receive PSC 833
      during induction chemotherapy receive a loading dose of PSC 833 before beginning a 48-hour
      continuous infusion of PSC 833 concurrently with cytarabine/daunorubicin/etoposide
      postremission chemotherapy.

      After completing postremission chemotherapy, patients are randomized to a no further
      treatment group or interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy. Treatment begins within 5 months of
      postremission chemotherapy. IL-2 immunotherapy consists of low-dose subcutaneous (SC) IL-2 on
      days 1-14, 19-28, 33-42, 47-56, 61-70, and 75-90 and high-dose bolus SC IL-2 on days 15-17,
      29-31, 43-45, 57-59, and 71-73.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, annually until
      the tenth year, and then at relapse.
