      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients with
      advanced gallbladder or bile duct cancer that cannot be removed surgically.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced
      gallbladder or bile duct tumors treated with irinotecan. II. Evaluate time-to-progression,
      survival, and toxic effects associated with irinotecan given weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks
      in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 90 minute continuous infusion of irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22 for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period. Courses of treatment are repeated every 42
      days. Patients continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for the next 4
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-4
      years.
