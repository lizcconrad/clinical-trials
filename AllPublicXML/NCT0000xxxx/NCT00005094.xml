  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of
      cancer. The use of celecoxib has been approved for use in reducing the number of adenomatous
      colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is not known whether there is a
      clinical benefit from a reduction in the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients. The use
      of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the development of sporadic adenomatous
      polyps, precursors of colorectal cancer. This randomized phase III trial is studying
      celecoxib to see how well it works compared to a placebo in preventing the development of
      adenomatous colorectal polyps in patients who have had at least one polyp removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of celecoxib in reducing the occurrence of new sporadic
      adenomatous polyps (SAP) in the colon and rectum in patients who have undergone polypectomy
      for previous SAP.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are entered
      on one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive celecoxib twice a day for 3 years.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo twice a day for 3 years.

      Patients are evaluated for adenomatous colorectal polyps at 1 and 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Over 1000 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Will be estimated using the life table method for each treatment group and compared using a life-table extension of the Mantel-Haenszel statistics with stratification for aspirin use.

    <measure>Percentage of patients with adenomas, aspirin use at baseline, and covariates</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>This will be derived by treatment group (celecoxib 400 mg bid, celecoxib 200 mg bid, or placebo) and low-dose aspirin use at baseline and in relationship to the patient's adenoma history at the year 3 colonoscopy. Of particular interest is whether the conditional rate of adenomas at year 5 differs by treatment group and strata with control for potential differences in these groups by adenoma history at year 3 colonoscopy, age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, concomitant use of NSAID's, total time on study drug, and other covariates.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has had a documented colonoscopy to the cecum, by a study physician, with
             adequate preparation resulting in diagnosis and clearance of an adenomatous polyp(s)
             within 24 weeks prior to study entry; the 24- week period begins from the time of
             colonoscopy, which had resulted in full visualization of colon/rectum or the time of
             removal of adenoma which ever had occurred first

          -  At the baseline colonoscopy, the subject must have one of the following documented:

               -  One adenomatous polyp &gt; 6 mm;

                    -  If the colonoscopy report says that a 6 mm polyp was removed, and the local
                       pathology report confirms that this adenoma was AT LEAST 6mm in any
                       dimension, the subject is eligible

                    -  If the colonoscopy report says that the 6mm polyp was removed, and the local
                       pathology report says that multiple fragments of adenoma were obtained, the
                       subject is eligible

                    -  If the colonoscopy report says that a 6mm polyp was removed, but the
                       pathologist measured this as 5mm or less in greatest dimension, the subject
                       is NOT eligible

               -  Two or more adenomatous polyps of any size documented by local pathology report

               -  One adenomatous polyp of any size and a documented history of adenomatous
                  polyp(s); if the colonoscopy report indicates that polyps of any size were left
                  in the subject, the subject is NOT eligible; if the colonoscopy report says that
                  all visible adenomas were removed, the subject is eligible.
