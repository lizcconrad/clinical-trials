      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate immunomodulation with extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) in
      patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

      II. Investigate the effect of ECP on lymphocyte activity.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Oral methoxsalen (8-MOP) is administered 90 minutes prior to leukapheresis.
      Blood mononuclear cells are exposed to ultraviolet A light for 3 hours, then returned to the
      patient. The process is repeated on 2 successive days.

      Patients are re-treated every 3 to 4 weeks for a total of 6 treatments or until the skin has
      cleared.
