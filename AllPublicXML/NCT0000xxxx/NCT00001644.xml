      This study will try to define how and where HIV infection persists in the body by
      determining: 1) if there are cells where HIV can live for long periods of time without being
      seen and destroyed by the immune system; 2) if there are sites where anti-HIV drugs cannot
      penetrate enough to stop new HIV replication; and 3) if HIV in certain lymph nodes can remain
      infectious for prolonged periods of time. It will also explore whether immune system damage
      caused by HIV can be repaired after new virus replication is stopped with treatment.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study, which will
      include three groups as follows. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical
      examination, blood and urine tests and possibly chest X-ray and electrocardiogram.

      Participants will be divided into three groups according to CD4 count levels: &gt; 500
      cells/microliter of blood; between 300 and 500 cells/microliter, and &lt; 300 cells/microliter
      of blood. All participants will be treated with a combination of four antiretroviral drugs:
      indinavir, zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. (Exceptions to this regimen may be made in
      certain circumstances for patients who cannot tolerate one of the four drugs.) In addition,
      they will undergo the following procedures:

      Blood tests - Blood tests will be done at screening and at study entry to evaluate the
      patient's health status and measure CD4 T cell count and plasma HIV levels; at the beginning
      of treatment to look for drug-related side effects; and during the course of the study to
      evaluate drug effectiveness in inhibiting HIV replication; CD4 T cell levels and function.

      Lymph node biopsy - Lymph node biopsies are done under local anesthesia. A small incision is
      made, the node is removed, and the incision is closed with stitches. Up to two nodes may be
      removed during each procedure. Patients with CD4 counts greater than 500 cells/microliter of
      blood and those with counts less than 300 cells/microliter will have three lymph node
      biopsies in order to 1) assess the effectiveness of therapy in inhibiting HIV replication in
      the nodes (the major site of replication); 2) determine how long HIV-infected cells may
      persist in the nodes after new replication is stopped by therapy; and 3) determine if immune
      damage caused by HIV can be repaired when virus replication is stopped. Lymph node biopsy in
      patients with counts between 300 and 500 cells/microliter of blood is required only at
      baseline, although follow-up biopsies are encouraged.

      Leukapheresis - In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm
      vein. The blood circulates through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed
      and collected. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle
      used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The collected
      white cells are used for special studies of the level and function of T cells before and
      after drug treatment. Patients with CD4 counts &gt; 500 cells/microliter and &lt; 300
      cells/microliter will undergo leukapheresis up to four times - at study entry and about 2, 6
      and 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy. Patients with CD4 counts between 300 and
      500 cells/microliter will have this procedure either at study entry and 6 and 12 weeks after
      initiation therapy, or on the same schedule as the other patients.

    <textblock>
      The reservoirs of HIV-1 infection that permit maintenance of persistent virus infection (even
      when virus replication cannot be detected using sensitive assays to quantify plasma HIV-1 RNA
      levels) are currently unknown. Potential sites for persistent HIV-1 infection include cells
      with chronic or latent infections, cells present in locations within the body where antiviral
      drugs may not penetrate in levels sufficient to prevent additional cycles of de novo virus
      infection (e.g., the central nervous system), the presence of susceptible target cells for
      virus infection that may not metabolize certain antiviral drugs to their active inhibitory
      forms (e.g., macrophages), or extracellular (possible infectious) virus that may be retained
      on the surface of follicular dendritic cells within lymphoid organs. In an attempt to
      determine which, if any, of these potential reservoirs contribute to persistent HIV-1
      infection, HIV-1-infected persons in two groups categorized by CD4+ T cell levels will be
      treated with concomitant administration of 4 antiviral drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine,
      indinavir and nevirapine) to accomplish maximal achievable suppression of virus replication.
      The rates of decay of virus and virus-infected cells following initiation of antiviral (and
      steroid) therapy will be monitored with sensitive, quantitative assays, and the identity and
      longevity of persistent sites of infection will be determined. This study may also illuminate
      to what extent HIV-1-induced immune system damage manifest as decreased CD4 T cell responses,
      a constricted repertoire of T cell antigen recognition, or as structural compromise of
      lymphoid tissue architecture can be reversed upon cessation of active HIV-1 replication by
      combinations of potent antiviral drugs.
