      RATIONALE: Giving defibrotide may be an effective treatment for liver damage that may result
      following peripheral stem cell transplantation.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying defibrotide to see how well it works in
      treating patients with severe liver disease after undergoing peripheral stem cell
      transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine complete response rate in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients
           with severe veno-occlusive disease of the liver treated with defibrotide.

        -  Determine the minimal effective dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess toxicity and adverse side effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. All patients initially receive the same
      dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on day 1. On day 2, patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 doses of defibrotide.

        -  Arm I: On days 2-14, patients receive a lower dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every
           6 hours.

        -  Arm II: On days 2-14, patients receive a higher dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours
           every 6 hours.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.

                    -  Patients with jaundice and reversal of flow on Doppler examination of the
                       portal vein will be eligible with one of the following: ascites, weight gain
                       &gt; 5% above baseline weight, hepatomegaly, RUQ pain

                    -  Patients with pre-existing hepatomegaly must have documentation by physical
                       exam or imaging that liver size is increased over baseline at admission

               -  Patients who do not meet the criteria in Section 3.1.1 (ie. have two of the major
                  criteria but not three) and have biopsy proven VOD are eligible in the presence
                  of characteristics consistent with severe disease (see below).

               -  Patients with concurrent, confounding causes of liver dysfunction clinically
                  evident or evident on ultrasound or other radiographic imaging (such as evidence
                  of biliary ductal dilatation or focal tissue defects) may require biopsy-proven
                  VOD and/or elevated wedged trans-hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement (
                  ≥10 mm mercury) to be considered eligible. Best medical judgment and further
                  imaging studies can be used to clarify the diagnosis and determine confounding
                  causes of liver dysfunction.

          -  Severity of VOD defined by:

               -  For patients addressed by the Bearman model (i.e. within 16 days of SCT and
                  conditioned with either BU/CY, CY/TBI or CBV), there must be a 30% or greater
                  risk of severe VOD (see Appendix B).

                       admission value, or c) dialysis dependence&quot;

                    -  pulmonary dysfunction: documentation of oxygenation saturation ≤ 90% on room
                       air; requirement for positive pressure/ventilator dependence

                    -  central nervous dysfunction: documentation of confusion, lethargy, and/or
                       delirium ---- central nervous dysfunction must not be attributable to
                       another cause (e.g. documented cyclosporin toxicity)

               -  Patients or their parents/guardians or designated proxy must have the ability to
                  give voluntary informed consent to the protocol. Where possible, patient assent
                  will also be obtained

               -  Patients must be ≥ 12 hours after cessation of heparin

               -  Patient must have an eligible diagnosis of VOD by Day 35 post transplant

          -  Exclusion Criteria

               -  Patients with significant uncontrolled acute bleeding, defined as hemorrhage
                  requiring &gt; 15 cc/kg of packed red blood cells (ie. a pediatric patient weighing

               -  Patients with hemodynamic instability as defined below:

                    -  Hemodynamic stability is defined as having no requirement for pressor
                       support OR being able to maintain mean arterial pressure within 1 SD of
                       age-adjusted levels with pressor support (see Appendix D)

                  --- Patients intubated secondary to a mechanical barrier to ventilation,
                  e.g.pulmonary edema or ascites, will be eligible as long as the PaO2/FiO2 ratio
                  is ≥ 300 and/or the oxygen index (OI={MAP x FiO2}÷ PaO2 x 100) is ≤ 25% at the
                  time of enrollment

               -  Patients who meet Grade IV common toxicity criteria for neurotoxicity (other than
                  Grade IV confusion and/or delirium), i.e. coma, seizures, toxic psychosis

               -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with another experimental agent.

               -  Please note that an experimental agent in this setting is defined as any drug or
                  device used under an IND designation which is associated with systemic effects
                  that could influence the outcome in a patient with severe VOD. If the continued
                  use of an experimental agent is considered both necessary and appropriate, this
                  must be reviewed and approved on a case by case basis by the Overall Study PI,
                  Dr. Paul Richardson, or his designate, who will approve the entry of patients
                  being concurrently treated with another experimental agent only if there is no
                  evidence for a potential adverse pharmacokinetic interaction or overlapping
                  toxicity.
