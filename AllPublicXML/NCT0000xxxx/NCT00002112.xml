  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy, safety, and toleration of fluconazole as a single daily oral
      suspension for 14 days versus nystatin oral suspension 4 times daily for 14 days in the
      treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with AIDS or HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive fluconazole oral suspension once daily (swallowed at
      approximately the same time every day) for 14 days or nystatin oral suspension used to rinse
      the mouth four times daily for 14 days. No food or drink is permitted immediately following
      the administration of the nystatin.
