  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of a melanoma tumor antigen peptide vaccine. Peptides representing HLA-A201
      restricted T cell epitopes of the melanoma antigens, MART-1, gp100 and tyrosinase will be
      administered emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant, (IFA) to HLA-A201 patients with
      melanoma. The study is designed to evaluate the potential therapeutic role, immunologic
      effects and toxicity of repeated doses of this peptide vaccine administered subcutaneously.

      Immune reactivity to the peptide epitope will be monitored in all patients by analysis of
      melanoma-specific T cell precursors prior to and after immunization.
