      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      relapsed small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate (complete or partial) and duration of
      response of patients with small cell lung cancer who have had at least a partial response to
      one prior chemotherapy regimen for at least 3 months when treated with R115777. II. Determine
      the time to disease progression, survival, and quality of life in this patient population
      treated with this drug. III. Assess the safety of R115777 in this patient population. IV.
      Assess the presence of ras mutations in relapsed patients with available paraffin blocks.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 14
      consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day
      15 of each course, and at the end of the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
