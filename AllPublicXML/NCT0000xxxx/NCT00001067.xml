  <brief_title>The Effectiveness of Three Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Used Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase II Randomized Study of the Virologic and Immunologic Effects of Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine (3TC) Versus d4T Versus Zidovudine Plus d4T in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 Cell Counts Between 300-600/mm3 and No Previous Nucleoside Experience</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine drug efficacy and safety in HIV-infected patients treated with zidovudine ( AZT
      ) versus stavudine ( d4T ) versus both drugs. Also, to compare short- and long-term changes
      in magnitude of HIV RNA over time.

      Asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts over 300 cells/mm3 are more likely to tolerate any of
      the nucleoside analogs. d4T, with a favorable toxicity profile and demonstrated anti-HIV
      activity in previous studies, provides an additional therapeutic option.

      Asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts over 300 cells/mm3 are more likely to tolerate any of
      the nucleoside analogs. d4T, with a favorable toxicity profile and demonstrated anti-HIV
      activity in previous studies, provides an additional therapeutic option.

      Patients are randomized to receive d4T alone, AZT alone, or both in combination for at least
      12 weeks. After week 12, 3TC is added to the combination arm. Treatment continues for up to
      48 weeks (was a total of 48 weeks, amended 3/26/96).
