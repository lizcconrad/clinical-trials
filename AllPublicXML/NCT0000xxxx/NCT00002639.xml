      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of suramin in treating patients with
      recurrent primary brain tumors following radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the efficacy of suramin in patients with recurrent primary brain
      tumors as measured by radiographic response, time to progression, and survival. II. Assess
      the toxic effects of suramin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Suramin, SUR, NSC-34936.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 of the first 14 patients experiences at least a partial
      response, a total of 25 patients will be entered over approximately 30 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Recurrent brain tumor based on one of the following: Tissue
        diagnosis if there was a prior diagnosis of astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma or if there is
        a question of radiation necrosis from prior interstitial brachytherapy Metabolic activity
        in excess of normal cortex measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET One of the
        following histologic types required: Glioblastoma multiforme Anaplastic astrocytoma
        Anaplastic oligodendroglioma Anaplastic mixed glioma Tumor progression required, i.e.: 28%
        increase in contrast-enhancing area or 50% increase in contrast- enhancing volume over at
        least 4 weeks Measurable disease required No history, surgical findings, or radiographic
        signs of intratumoral hemorrhage

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 15 Performance status: Karnofsky 50%-100% Life
        expectancy: At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,000 Platelets at least 75,000
        Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL AST/ALT less than 3 times normal No history of
        bleeding disorder No hepatic disease resulting in hospitalization Renal: Creatinine less
        than 1.5 mg/dL No renal disease resulting in hospitalization Cardiovascular: No ongoing
        anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) No residual symptoms from DVT after
        discontinuation of anticoagulation No cardiac disease resulting in hospitalization
        Pulmonary: No pulmonary disease resulting in hospitalization Other: No peripheral
        neuropathy of any etiology HIV negative No pregnant or nursing women Adequate contraception
        required during and for 12 months following protocol therapy

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior
        chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for
        anaplastic astrocytoma, malignant oligodendroglioma, or malignant mixed glioma At least 4
        weeks since chemotherapy (6 weeks since nitrosoureas or mitomycin) Endocrine therapy: Not
        specified Radiotherapy: Completion of 1 course of conventional external radiotherapy
        required At least 4 weeks since radiotherapy Surgery: Decompressive surgery for clinically
        suspected increased intracranial pressure performed prior to entry
