  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile and efficacy of combination therapy will be evaluated using methotrexate
      (MTX) and the nucleoside analog fludarabine in 40 patients with severe refractory rheumatoid
      arthritis. The patients enrolled will be those who have experienced inadequate disease
      control with MTX alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as
      sulfasalazine (SSZ), cyclosporin A (CsA), or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial, patients will be maintained on oral MTX at 17.5
      mg/week to which either placebo or subcutaneous fludarabine at 30 mg/m(2) daily for three
      consecutive days per month will be added for four months. The fludarabine (or placebo)
      treatment period will be followed by two months of follow-up, at which time patients will be
      evaluated for response. Patients will be monitored for adverse effects/tolerability, disease
      activity, and changes in synovial volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Additionally synovial biopsies will be obtained before and after treatment for investigation
      of infiltrating cell numbers and phenotypes, cytokine profiles, Th1 versus Th2 responses, and
      angiogenesis.

        Ability to provide informed consent to all aspects of the study after full information is
        provided.

        Age equal to or older than 18.

        A diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) of more than 6 months as defined by the revised
        American College of Rheumatology criteria.

        Active RA defined as: 6 or more swollen joints;

        6 or more tender joints;

        ESR greater than 28 mm/hr (or CRP greater than 0.8) or morning stiffness greater than 45
        minutes.

        Incomplete response (defined as persistently active disease as described above) to
        treatment with at least one of the following regimens for over 3 months:

        MTX alone (greater than or equal to 17.5 mg/week);

        MTX (greater than or equal to 17.5 mg/week) plus HCQ (greater than or equal to 200 mg/day);

        MTX (greater than or equal to 17.5 mg/week) plus SSZ (greater than or equal to 1 gm/d);

        MTX (greater than or equal to 17.5 mg/week) plus CsA (1-3 mg/kg/day);

        MTX (greater than or equal to 17.5 mg/week) plus SSZ (greater than 1 gm/day) plus HCQ
        (greater than or equal to 200 mg/day);

        No requirement of corticosteroids in doses equivalent to over 10 mg/d prednisone nor other
        immunosuppressive agents required for the control of extraarticular manifestations at the
        time of study entry.

        No active acute or chronic infections requiring antibiotic therapy, serious viral
        infections (such as hepatitis, herpes zoster, or HIV), or serious fungal infections.

        will be excluded.

        first degree, or a dysrhythmia requiring therapy.

        risk for study participants (e.g., chronic hepatic, renal, or pulmonary disease or bone
        marrow hypoplasia).

        No presence of seronegative spondyloarthropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic
        sclerosis, inflammatory myopathy, systemic vasculitis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel
        disease.

        sustained for at least 1 month.

        than 100,000, or white blood count less than 3,500/dL.

        No patients with active lung disease, patients with a chronic and progressive lung disease,
        or patients with a chronic but stable lung disease with pulmonary function tests of less
        than 70% of predicted (DLCO less than 60%).

        No patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG count less than 300).

        No patients treated with alkylating agents for over 1 year at any time or treated with a
