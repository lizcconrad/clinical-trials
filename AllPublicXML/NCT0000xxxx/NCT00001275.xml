  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No proven therapy to restore ovarian function and fertility is available to patients with
      karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure. We know that one-half of these
      patients have primordial follicles remaining in the ovary, and these follicles can function
      intermittently. This is a diagnostic omnibus protocol that permits baseline clinical
      evaluation of patients with prematurem ovarian failure. The findings will determine patients'
      suitability for specifically focused therapeutic research protocols.

      No proven therapy to restore ovarian function and fertility is available to patients with
      karyotypically normal spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency. We know that more than
      one-half of these patients have primordial follicles remaining in the ovary, and these
      follicles can function intermittently. This protocol permitted baseline clinical evaluation
      of patients with primary ovarian insufficiency and ongoing observation of the natural history
      of the disorder. The protocol is now in the follow up and analysis phase and is not now
      recruiting new patients. Now a major aim of the protocol is to investigate large scale
      medical sequencing as a method by which to uncover mechanisms of primary ovarian
      insufficiency and to assist in the management of women with this condition. This will involve
      a community-based participatory research approach.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women 18 to 42 years of age with primary ovarian insufficiency who meet the following
        requirements were candidates for recruitment to the study: 1) at least a four month history
        of oligo-amenorrhea not due to pregnancy, and 2) clearly elevated gonadotropins in the
        menopausal range on two separate occasions at least one month apart.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women with evidence for karyotypic, metabolic, toxic, or iatrogenic cause of the ovarian
        insufficiency were not candidates.
