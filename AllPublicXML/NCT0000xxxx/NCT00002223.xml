      The purpose of this study is to determine how many HIV-infected patients continue taking
      ritonavir/indinavir combination after having taken indinavir three times a day as part of
      their anti-HIV drug therapy. This study also examines the safety and effectiveness of the
      ritonavir/indinavir combination.
