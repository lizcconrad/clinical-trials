      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine followed by
      radiation therapy in treating adults who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of pyrazoloacridine
           in adults with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with
           pyrazoloacridine followed by radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the response rate, duration of disease free survival, and survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      type of anticonvulsant (hepatic metabolic enzyme inducers vs hepatic metabolic enzyme
      moderate inducers or noninducers).

      Patients receive pyrazoloacridine (PZA) IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Following completion of PZA treatment, patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days
      a week for 6 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PZA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. Additional patients receive PZA at the MTD.

      Patients are followed monthly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 18-35
      patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.
