    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of rebeccamycin
      analogue in treating women who have stage IIIB or stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. The best way to give rebeccamycin analog in breast cancer patients is not yet known

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the activity of rebeccamycin analog as therapy for advanced breast cancer when
      administered in two different treatment schedules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with administration of rebeccamycin analog therapy in
      women with advanced breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate topoisomerase I and II levels in human lymphocytes following treatment with
      rebeccamycin analog.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on day 1.

      Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer;
             patients without pathologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease should have
             unequivocal evidence of metastasis on radiographic study or physical exam; patients
             must have metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, or locally advanced (stage IIIB) breast
             cancer that cannot be treated with curative intent

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 10 mm with
             conventional techniques; lytic bone lesions meeting these criteria will be considered
             measurable disease

          -  Patients are required to have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced
             breast cancer unless they have progressed within 12 months of concluding adjuvant
             chemotherapy; patients may not have had more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for
             advanced breast cancer; treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell support in
             the metastatic setting, including induction chemotherapy, will be considered 2
             treatment regimens; patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy; patients who
             have metastatic breast cancer diagnosed within 12 months of concluding adjuvant
             chemotherapy will be eligible after 0 or 1 regimens in the metastatic setting;
             patients may have received prior hormonal therapy of any type; patients may have been
             previously treated with investigational agents or biological agents (e.g. Herceptin)

          -  Patients must have concluded prior therapy no less than the duration of one cycle of
             treatment prior to beginning treatment with rebeccamycin analog, but in all cases
             there must be at least a 2 week interval since last treatment; thus, if a patient is
             receiving therapy every three weeks, the patient must be at least three weeks from the
             last treatment before beginning protocol-based therapy; patients must have recovered
             from the toxicities of prior therapy, and meet the performance status and laboratory
             criteria for eligibility before beginning treatment

          -  Patients may not receive concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy; all other radiation
             therapy, hormonal therapy, or treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) must be stopped
             prior to treatment on protocol; patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy may continue
             to receive these treatments while on protocol

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Sodium (Na) within normal institutional limits

          -  Serum lipase within normal institutional limits

          -  Serum amylase within normal institutional limits

          -  Because rebeccamycin analog has been associated with phlebitis, all therapy on
             protocol will be given through a central venous line; patients not willing to have a
             central line, or those in whom central venous access could not be established, will
             not be eligible

          -  The effects of rebeccamycin analog on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation; women should not become pregnant or nurse, nor expect to become
             pregnant or nurse, during the study; women in whom there is a suspicion of possible
             pregnancy must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test prior to beginning
             therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with only non-measurable disease, defined as all other lesions, including
             small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 10 mm with conventional techniques) and truly
             non-measurable lesions, which include the following:

               -  Bone lesions, except pure lytic lesions

               -  Leptomeningeal disease

               -  Tumor markers

               -  Ascites

               -  Pleural/pericardial effusions

          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study or those
             who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior chemotherapy administered
             previously

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational anti-neoplastic agents, with
             the following exceptions: patients may participate in concurrent studies of supportive
             therapies, including anti-nausea or bisphosphonate-based treatments

          -  Patients with known brain metastases may be included if they meet the following 2
             criteria:

               -  Completed whole brain irradiation at least two months prior to study entry

               -  Have no symptoms from brain metastases

          -  Lack of central venous access

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated on study

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study
