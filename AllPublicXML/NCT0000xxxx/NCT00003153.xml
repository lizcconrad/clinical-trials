      RATIONALE: White blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with
      multiple myeloma that has recurred following bone marrow transplantation.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving donor white blood cells works in
      treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma who have undergone bone marrow
      transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the response rate of patients with recurrent multiple myeloma after an allogeneic
           marrow transplant from a genotypically HLA identical sibling donor treated with donor
           lymphocyte infusions as salvage therapy .

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this treatment when used as salvage therapy in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive initial cell dose of donor lymphocytes (CD3+ cells) IV over 15-30
      minutes. Patients with rapidly progressive disease may skip the initial cell dose and proceed
      directly to dose escalation to receive CD3+ cells at a higher cell dose. Patients who achieve
      complete response to the initial treatment may receive up to 2 additional courses of
      escalating doses of CD3+ cells 8-12 weeks apart in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks after each infusion. Patients with disease
      progression at 8 weeks are retreated at that time. Patients who achieve partial response or
      stable disease at 8 weeks are re-evaluated at 12 weeks and may then be retreated.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 3 months, once a month for 9 months, and then every 2
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or persistent multiple myeloma at least 6 months
             following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA identical sibling

          -  Must meet one of following criteria to be considered persistent, recurrent, or
             progressive disease:

               -  Residual detectable disease 6-12 months after BMT, as determined by the M protein
                  level or bone marrow involvement, without further evidence of clinical or
                  laboratory improvement on 2 consecutive measurements 4 weeks apart

               -  Complete response not achieved 12 or more months after BMT and there is no
                  evidence of progressive improvement

               -  At least 25% increase of serum paraprotein (greater than 1.0 g/dL) as measured on
                  two occasions or a 50% increase in urinary light chain excretion (greater than
                  150 mg/day) as measured on 2 occasions

               -  A 10% increase in plasma cells in the bone marrow
