      RATIONALE: ISIS 2503 may kill cancer cells by inhibiting a gene that promotes the development
      and growth of cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ISIS 2503 in treating patients who have
      metastatic and/or locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, and time to progression in
      patients with metastatic and/or locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
      treated with ISIS 2503, an antisense inhibitor of H-ras. II. Determine the safety profile of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days.
      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
