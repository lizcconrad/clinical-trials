  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A: To evaluate the impact of HSV suppression with acyclovir ( ACV ) on HIV burden in
      patients with asymptomatic HSV infection and at high risk for HSV reactivation.

      Part B: To characterize the change in plasma HIV RNA levels and other measures of HIV burden
      during and after a 10 day course of ACV treatment for acute HSV infection.

      Approximately 70% of patients infected with HIV are concurrently infected with HSV. There is
      new evidence to suggest that HSV may act as a co-factor in HIV disease progression. This
      study will attempt to determine if the upregulation of HIV RNA that occurs during symptomatic
      HSV reactivation also occurs during asymptomatic HSV reactivation and if suppression of HSV
      will result in decreased levels of HIV RNA. There is a need to determine the patterns of
      association between HSV and HIV.

      Approximately 70% of patients infected with HIV are concurrently infected with HSV. There is
      new evidence to suggest that HSV may act as a co-factor in HIV disease progression. This
      study will attempt to determine if the upregulation of HIV RNA that occurs during symptomatic
      HSV reactivation also occurs during asymptomatic HSV reactivation and if suppression of HSV
      will result in decreased levels of HIV RNA. There is a need to determine the patterns of
      association between HSV and HIV.

      Part A: 60 approved HIV infected patients will be randomized to either suppressive ACV
      therapy or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Serology for HSV serum antibodies will be obtained
      at screening and a full history and physical exam will be performed on Day 1 and interval
      examinations at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Extensive clinical exams will be conducted on a regular
      schedule throughout the 12 weeks.

      Part B: 15 approved HIV infected patients will receive treatment with ACV until resolution of
      the lesion. All patients will be monitored on Day 9-12 of ACV therapy for crusting and
      resolutions of HSV lesions and will be followed for 3.5 months.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/97: Noncommercial active acyclovir will be made available for Part A
      patients wo develop acute HSV while on study and for Part B patients who develop acute HSV
      after completion of the acute phase of treatment ( i.e., during the follow-up phase).
