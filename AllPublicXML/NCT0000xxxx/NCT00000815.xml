  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare measles seroconversion rates (development of antibodies) at 13 months of age in
      HIV-infected and uninfected children on one of two immunization schedules: attenuated
      measles/mumps/rubella virus (M-M-R II) vaccine at 12 months versus attenuated measles vaccine
      (Attenuvax) at 6 months plus M-M-R II vaccine at 12 months.

      Recommendations for the age at vaccination should balance the need to minimize the risk of
      morbidity and mortality with the benefit of achieving the highest seroconversion rates.
      Immunizing a more intact immune system at an earlier stage of HIV infection may in turn
      achieve better and long-lasting measles protection. This study will help define a more
      effective measles vaccine regimen for children diagnosed with HIV infection and will provide
      greater insight into the functional status of the HIV-infected children's humoral immune
      system.

      system.

      Patients, HIV infected and uninfected, are randomized to one of two attenuated measles
      vaccine schedules: at 6 and 12 months of age, or at 12 months of age only. Attenuvax is
      administered as the month 6 vaccine and M-M-R II as the month 12 vaccine. Patients are
      followed for 24 months after the last vaccination.
