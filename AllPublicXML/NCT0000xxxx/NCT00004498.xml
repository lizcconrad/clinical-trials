      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of intravascular adenoviral
      vector mediated gene transfer in the liver in adults with partial ornithine transcarbamylase
      deficiency.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo a femoral arterial
      placement of a hepatic intraarterial catheter. Patients then receive adenoviral vector
      mediated gene transfer intravascularly over 30 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of adenoviral vector until the maximum
      tolerated dose is determined.

      Patients are followed at 3, 5, 7, 8, 15, and 29 days, at 2 months, and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
