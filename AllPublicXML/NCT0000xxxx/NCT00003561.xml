    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Colony-stimulating
      factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or
      peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of
      therapy. Combining sargramostim with interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim in treating patients who
      are receiving interferon alfa for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is in
      remission.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the rate of major cytogenetic responses to sargramostim (GM-CSF) and
      interferon alfa in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. II.
      Estimate the dosing, schedule, and toxic effects of GM-CSF plus interferon alfa in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients are in hematologic remission on subcutaneous interferon alfa upon
      entering the study. Once a complete hematologic response is achieved and the interferon alfa
      dose has been stable for 14 days, patients receive subcutaneous sargramostim (GM-CSF) daily
      for 6 months. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
