  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected
      individuals(1-3). There is at least a 10 fold greater viral burden per given number of CD4+ T
      lymphocytes obtained from the lymph nodes versus the peripheral blood in the same infected
      individual. These data have been accumulated predominantly in individuals with progressive
      generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC Class A1 and A2). It is unclear at present whether this
      pattern holds true for all categories of HIV infected individuals. We have proposed that the
      seeding of lymph nodes by HIV early in the course of HIV infection and the persistent
      production of virus in lymph nodes throughout the course of infection are major factors in
      the pathogenesis of HIV in virtually all infected individuals. In addition, it is likely that
      the selective perturbations of various T cell subsets (i.e., V-B classes of CD4+T cells) that
      have been observed in peripheral blood are much more dramatic in the lymph node given the
      greater viral burden in the lymph node compared to the peripheral blood. In order to
      investigate this hypothesis, it is essential that we study simultaneously lymph nodes and
      peripheral blood from the same individuals and that we study different individuals at various
      stages of disease from early in the course of infection (CDC Class A) to advanced disease
      (CDC Class B and C). If, as we suspect, there is active virus replication in the lymph node
      early in the course of infection, even at a time when there is little virus burden or active
      replication in the peripheral blood, this would justify anti-retroviral therapy at the
      earliest possible time in the course of infection. In addition, in certain patients who are
      about to initiate treatment with an anti-retroviral agent such as zidovudine or didanosine
      through their private physician, it would be important to know whether treatment actually
      reduces the viral burden and virus replication in lymph nodes. The effect of therapy on viral
      burden and replication will be compared in the lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and both of these parameters will be compared with the level of plasma viremia.

      Several years ago, we and others demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected
      individuals. Subsequent studies from our group showed that virologic cross talk between B
      cells and CD4+ T cells occurs within the microenvironment of lymphoid tissues (LT), and that
      immunosuppressive CD25+CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells enriched in the LT. Furthermore, Treg
      cells isolated from the LT are particularly effective in suppressing HIV-specific cytolytic
      activity. More recently, follicular helper (Tfh) CD4+ T cells have been described in LT and
      found to play an important role in providing help to B cells during germinal center
      reactions. These Tfh cells are expanded in HIV-infected viremic individuals and their numbers
      correlate with frequencies of germinal center B cells, consistent with longstanding
      observations of HIV-induced GC hyperplasia in untreated infected individuals. Despite the
      increased frequencies of Tfh and GC B cells in LT, there is also evidence for reduced immune
      function due to over-expression of negative regulatory molecules. We are currently
      investigating several issues related to the impact of HIV infection/replication on the immune
      competence and homing profiles of numerous cell types within the LT. Given the paucity of Tfh
      and GC B cells in the peripheral blood, these studies are more appropriately conducted with
      tissue samples. We will also pursue immunological, migrational and virologic characteristics
      of various cell types including B cells and their subsets and CD4+, CD8+ and NK cells in the
      LT and bone marrow (BM) tissue. In this regard, the BM is both the site of B-cell development
      and the only known long-lived repository of plasma cells that are responsible for maintaining
      humoral immunity. While HIV infection has been shown to impair hematopoiesis in the BM,
      relatively little is known regarding the effect of HIV infection on plasma cells that home
      back to the BM after maturation.
