  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A stroke occurs when part of the brain is damaged from lack of normal blood supply. This may
      result in difficulty with feeling, speech, muscle strength or coordination, movement,
      thinking, or other brain functions. Having a stroke increases the risk of another stroke
      occurring in the future. Higher blood levels of a natural chemical known as homocysteine may
      contribute to hardening of the arteries in the brain or heart and increase the risk of stroke
      or heart attack. Folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) may
      lower blood levels of homocysteine and reduce the risk of having another stroke or a heart
      attack.

      The incidence of a second stroke in patients who have had a first stroke is between 7 and 10
      percent per year. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a complication of stroke adds to
      stroke death and disability. Because homocysteine may be a major contributor to stroke, its
      reduction by appropriate intervention with vitamin supplements could reduce the impact of
      recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death. The purpose of this trial is to
      determine whether a multivitamin containing high-dose folic acid, pyridoxine, and
      cyanocobalamin, in addition to best medical/surgical management and risk factor modification,
      reduces the recurrence of stroke or occurrence of myocardial infarction in stroke patients
      with elevated homocysteine levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any stroke (non-disabling cerebral infarction, NDCI) &lt; 120 days prior to randomization

          -  Symptoms lasting &gt; 24 hrs, or if &lt; 24 hrs, CT or MRI shows new infarction at expected
             site

          -  Modified Rankin score &lt; 3

          -  Homocysteine level &gt; the 25th percentile, ie, 9.5 mol/L for men, and 8.5 mol/L for
             women

          -  Patient compliance with multivitamin during run-in phase &gt; 75%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke due to: intracranial hemorrhage, dissection of a cervico-cephalic artery,
             veno-occlusive disease, drug abuse, vasculitis

          -  CT or MRI shows lesion other than infarction as cause of syndrome

          -  Modified Rankin score of 4 or 5 at eligibility

          -  Presence of potential sources of cardiogenic emboli: atrial fibrillation, prosthetic
             cardiac valve, intracardiac thrombus or neoplasm, valvular vegetation

          -  Neurologic illness other than stroke that would prevent proper evaluation of recurrent
             stroke

          -  Illness that limits life expectancy to &lt; 2 years

          -  Severe congestive heart failure

          -  Renal insufficiency requiring dialysis

          -  Untreated B12 deficiency or untreated pernicious anemia

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;185 mm/Hg or diastolic &gt;105 mm/Hg on two readings
             separated by 5 min.) at eligibility

          -  Conditions preventing reliable participation in study: refractory depression, severe
             cognitive impairment, alcoholism, other substance abuse

          -  Medications given within last 30 days that affect homocysteine: methotrexate,
             tamoxifen, L-dopa, phenytoin, or bile acid sequestrants that can decrease folate
             levels

          -  Women of childbearing potential

          -  Patients receiving active intervention in another trial

          -  Patients on multi-vitamins, single B6, or folic acid, unless willing to discontinue
             and take study supplement

          -  Any surgical procedure, invasive cardiac instrumentation, endarterectomy, stent
             placement, thrombectomy or other endovascular treatment of abnormal carotid artery
             performed within 30 days prior to randomization or scheduled within 30 days after
             randomization
