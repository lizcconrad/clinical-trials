      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Retrovir (AZT) administered orally as 1 of 3 doses in the
      treatment of patients with severe clinical and laboratory manifestations of HIV infection. To
      compare the safety and tolerance of AZT administered 2, 3, and 6 x daily to these patients.
