      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist guanfacine in children
      and adolescents with Tourette syndrome or other chronic tic disorder, and attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      pubertal status.

      There is a 7- to 14-day washout with a placebo prior to treatment for all patients.

      The first group receives oral guanfacine 3 times a day for 8 weeks. The dose is gradually
      increased to minimize sedation; by day 14, most patients are stabilized and the dose is then
      increased as clinically indicated and tolerated.

      The second group receives a placebo 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Patients in either group may
      be treated with guanfacine for an additional 8 weeks.
