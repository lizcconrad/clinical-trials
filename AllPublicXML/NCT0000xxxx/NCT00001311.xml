    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an intraocular lens treated with heparin in
      reducing or preventing inflammation after cataract surgery in patients with uveitis.

      Patients with uveitis (inflammatory eye disease) often develop cataracts (clouding of the
      lens of the eye) that can impair eyesight. Cataracts can be removed surgically, and this is
      usually done when poor vision interferes with adequate daily functioning, or when the lens
      becomes too cloudy to evaluate the level of eye inflammation in uveitis-information needed to
      adjust medication dosages. After surgery, vision is corrected with special eyeglasses,
      contact lenses, or intraocular lenses (IOL). IOLs are small, plastic artificial lenses
      permanently placed inside the eye.

      Patients with uveitis who require cataract surgery and whose eye inflammation has been
      controlled by medicine for at least 3 months may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled
      in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: one group will have a
      standard IOL implanted during cataract surgery; the other will receive a heparin-treated IOL.

      Before surgery, patients will undergo standard preoperative tests, including chest X-ray,
      electrocardiogram, blood tests and urinalysis, as well as an eye examination that includes
      photography of the cornea, iris and retina. Additional tests and examinations to be done at
      the start of the study and at periodic follow-up visits for about 1 year may include:
      fluorescein angiography to evaluate the blood vessels of the retina; specular microscopy to
      examine the surface of the IOL; cell and flare measurements to evaluate inflammation, and
      ultrasound to examine the back of the eye.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the ability of a heparin-surface modified
      intraocular lens to reduce the incidence and severity of post-operative inflammation in
      patients with uveitis undergoing extracapsular cataract surgery. Patients who have a history
      of uveitis and have been in remission on steroids and/or cyclosporine or cytotoxic agents for
      at least three months will be considered for this study. They will be randomized in a masked
      fashion to either a surface-modified lens or to a non-modified lens of similar design. The
      intraocular inflammation will be assessed using standardized clinical criteria, and by a
      laser cell flare meter at those sites using this equipment. The presence of inflammatory
      cells on the lens surface will be assessed using specular micrography. In an initial period,
      the study will only be carried out in the Clinical Center of the National Eye Institute (NEI)
      at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, in order to complete the study in a
      reasonable period of time, it may be expanded to include several outside centers.
