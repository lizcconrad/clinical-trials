      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with G-CSF may make tumor cells more
      sensitive to the chemotherapy drug and may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone plus G-CSF in treating
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic, hormone
      refractory prostate cancer. II. Assess the side effects of mitoxantrone in this patient
      population. III. Determine whether filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF)
      treatment can overcome chronic bone marrow suppression and facilitate a dose intensive
      mitoxantrone chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive a 30 minute intravenous infusion
      of mitoxantrone once a week on day 1. On days 2-6 of each week, patients receive subcutaneous
      filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). Treatment continues for patients
      who respond to therapy and exhibit no disease progression. Dose escalation proceeds until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mitoxantrone with G-CSF support is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 20-40 patients are enrolled at this dose
      level to examine their response to this therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of
      this protocol. An additional 20-40 patients may be accrued for the phase II portion of this
      study.
