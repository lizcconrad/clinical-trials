  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gyrate atrophy is a rare hereditary disease of the eye's retina (the layer of light-sensitive
      tissue that lines the inside of the eyeball) and choroid (a vascular layer of tissue behind
      the retina). Degeneration of these structures causes near-sightedness, cataracts and
      progressive loss of vision. This study will examine eye function and chemical and molecular
      abnormalities in patients with gyrate atrophy to try to better understand, diagnose, and
      treat the condition. Patients with other degenerative diseases of the choroid and retina,
      such as retinitis pigmentosa, choroideremia, and others, will also be studied for comparison.
      Family members of patients will be studied, when possible, to try to identify the genetic
      basis of the disease and gain information that will aid in genetic counseling.

      Study participants will undergo a physical examination and eye examination, including tests
      of color vision, field of vision, and ability to see in the dark. An electroretinogram and
      electrooculogram will measure visual cell function. Photographs of the retina will be taken.
      Blood will be drawn for biochemical study and gene research. Family members who agree to
      participate in the study will undergo the same eye tests and will also have blood drawn for
      genetic studies. Patients with gyrate atrophy will also be asked to undergo a small skin
      biopsy for biochemical and genetic study. They will provide a family history in order to draw
      a family tree showing how the disease is distributed among family members.

      Patients with gyrate atrophy may also participate in studies of the effect of vitamin B6 and
      diet on blood levels of the amino acid ornithine, which is elevated in patients with gyrate
      atrophy. Participants will take 500 mg of vitamin B6 by mouth every day for 3 to 6 months. If
      this study confirms a reduction of ornithine levels, then long-term studies of the vitamin as
      a possible treatment for the disease may be started.

      After the vitamin B6 study, patients will start a nearly protein-free diet to lower ornithine
      blood levels. More than 2,000 calories are carbohydrate and fat. Some special low-protein
      foods and limited fruit is included, plus amino acid supplements. Patients who have carefully
      adhered to this diet have lowered their ornithine levels and slowed disease progression.
      Patients will be hospitalized for the first 1 to 3 weeks for close monitoring with frequent
      urine and blood tests. When the blood ornithine level is normalized, a less restricted low
      protein diet will be prescribed. Participants will have monthly blood tests and a complete
      eye examination every 6 months to 1 year to evaluate disease progression.

    <textblock>
      Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive chorioretinal
      degeneration characterized by myopia, cataract, varying degrees of night blindness, and
      progressive constriction of visual fields associated with chorioretinal atrophy resulting in
      blindness. The objectives of this protocol are threefold:

        1. Document the natural history of gyrate atrophy.

        2. Relate the clinical course to the gene defect to explore the genetic heterogeneity
           inherent in this disease.

        3. Assess the clinical course and laboratory findings of the effects of an
           arginine-deficient diet. The study population is patients with elevated plasma ornithine
           and absence of ornithine-delta-aminotransferase activity. This is a natural history
           study, with a nested intervention study, non-randomized, with the outcome parameters
           being psychophysical, electrophysiological and ophthalmoscopic examination.
