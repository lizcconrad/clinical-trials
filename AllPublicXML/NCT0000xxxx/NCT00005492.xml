      BACKGROUND:

      Over the last 25 years, a sustained and marked decline in death rates from coronary heart
      disease (CHD) has occurred for all major segments of the U.S. population. Recently, however,
      the decline has proceeded less rapidly in blacks than in whites, and in women than men. These
      trends have focused further attention on possible heterogeneity in the risk factor patterns
      among the demographic sub-groups. Previous studies of CHD risk factors in blacks and whites
      using the First National Health and Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
      (NHEFS-I, 11-year follow-up), including this group's own work, demonstrate its potential
      strengths, while at the same time foundering on the problem of low statistical power. With
      the extension of the follow-up of NHANES-I cohort (1971-1974) to 1987 (14 years) and the
      completion of 14-year follow-up for NHANES II cohort (1976-1980), a strong rationale exists
      to undertake a &quot;pooling project.&quot; The resulting data set would provide optimal
      characterization of CHD risk at the national level.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study sought to determine whether data from NHANES I and NHANES II could be pooled. To
      accomplish this, the distribution of baseline measures was assessed and a determination was
      made whether the same logistic prediction equations fitted both studies. Also, gender-race
      differences were examined in individual exposure-outcome relationships, patterns of
      co-morbidity, and population attributable risks.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
