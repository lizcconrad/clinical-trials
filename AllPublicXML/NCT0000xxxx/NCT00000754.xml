  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of two doses of interferon alfa-2a ( IFN alfa-2a ) in
      combination with zidovudine ( AZT )/zalcitabine ( ddC ) versus AZT/ddC only in patients with
      HIV infection and CD4 count &lt; 400 cells/mm3.

      AZT and ddC inhibit HIV by acting as reverse transcriptase chain terminators, while IFN
      alfa-2a inhibits translation of viral proteins. Combining agents that act at different sites
      of viral replication may improve HIV inhibition and produce more effective and sustained
      anti-HIV effects.

      AZT and ddC inhibit HIV by acting as reverse transcriptase chain terminators, while IFN
      alfa-2a inhibits translation of viral proteins. Combining agents that act at different sites
      of viral replication may improve HIV inhibition and produce more effective and sustained
      anti-HIV effects.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms to receive AZT/ddC alone or
      combined with one of two doses of IFN alfa-2a. Treatment continues for up to 12 months after
      enrollment of the last patient. Patients are followed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks
      thereafter. Mean duration of follow-up is expected to be 13 months.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Isoniazid for &lt; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (if patient is also taking 50 mg/day

             protocol chairs).

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiation therapy (unless approved by the protocol chairs).

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of intolerance to AZT at 600 mg/day or less.

          -  Unexplained temperature of 38.5 degrees C persisting for 14 days or longer.
