  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This diagnostic trial is studying the presence of a specific protein as a potential biomarker
      of cervical dysplasia and/or cancer. The presence of specific proteins may allow a doctor to
      determine whether a patient has cervical dysplasia and/or cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the utility of MN protein, a novel tumor-associated antigen, as a potential
      diagnostic biomarker for cervical glandular and/or squamous neoplasia in patients with a
      cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS).

      II. Measure the frequency and type of cervical pathology associated with the diagnosis of
      AGUS in these patients.

      III. Determine whether the presence of a high-risk type of human papilloma virus (HPV) in a
      ThinPrep cervical cell specimen predicts the presence of cervical glandular and/or squamous
      cell neoplasia in these patients.

      IV. Determine the relationship between MN antigen expression and the presence of high-risk
      HPV in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo a Pap smear followed by a ThinPrep cervical cell specimen collection at the
      time of direct colposcopic examination. Patients then undergo a cone biopsy of the cervix
      using loop electrosurgical excision procedure with an endocervical curettage, an excisional
      cone biopsy of the cervix with or without endocervical curettage, or a hysterectomy. Patients
      who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal or have a negative cervical cone biopsy also undergo
      endometrial biopsy or curettage. The Pap smear specimen is analyzed to determine MN antigen
      expression and the ThinPrep specimen is analyzed for the presence of high-risk human
      papilloma virus and to determine MN antigen and other marker (e.g., P16) expression.

      Patients who do not undergo hysterectomy are followed every 6 months for 2 years. All other
      patients are followed at 4, 26, and 30 weeks.
