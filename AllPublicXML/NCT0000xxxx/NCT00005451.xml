      BACKGROUND:

      CATI (Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing) became a primary means of obtaining quality
      epidemiological data. Its use steadily increased and in 1995 it was a major technology in use
      by almost every NIH Institute. Although CATI had been used for many years, its implementation
      had not kept up with technological developments in computers. Available CATI software
      products were deficient in features, inflexible, difficult to learn to use and had copious
      problems. Modern computer technology had the potential to satisfy the growing need for an
      improved product. This product had applications in over 3000 U.S. companies engaged in public
      opinion and market research.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In Phase I the investigators identified approaches that could be used to develop this
      software; justified and chose an approach; created requirements and designed specifications
      for the tool; developed a prototype; and produced a detailed project plan for implementation.
      In Phase II, the investigators completed and improved the prototype software and tested it in
      several areas
