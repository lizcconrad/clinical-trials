      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate to temozolomide in previously treated
      (closed to accrual 8/01) and chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. II. Determine the freedom from progression median, and 1-year and 2-year survival
      rates in these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (yes (closed to accrual 8/01) vs no).
      Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 42 days. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up
      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 66 patients (33 per stratum (previously treated stratum closed to
      accrual 8/01)) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
