  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the toxicity of low dose foscarnet administered for 4 weeks to HIV infected
      patients who are asymptomatic, have AIDS, or other HIV associated conditions and a CD4+
      lymphocyte count &lt; 500 cells/mm3. To obtain preliminary efficacy data. Although zidovudine
      (AZT) has been effective in treating some AIDS patients, AZT has toxic effects in many
      patients and other means of treating HIV-infected persons need to be evaluated. In vitro
      (test tube) studies have shown that the human herpes viruses are inhibited by foscarnet and
      that a number of retroviruses, including HIV, are sensitive to it. It is hoped that treatment
      of HIV-infected individuals with foscarnet during an early phase of HIV infections will
      reduce the risk of developing AIDS.

      Although zidovudine (AZT) has been effective in treating some AIDS patients, AZT has toxic
      effects in many patients and other means of treating HIV-infected persons need to be
      evaluated. In vitro (test tube) studies have shown that the human herpes viruses are
      inhibited by foscarnet and that a number of retroviruses, including HIV, are sensitive to it.
      It is hoped that treatment of HIV-infected individuals with foscarnet during an early phase
      of HIV infections will reduce the risk of developing AIDS.

      Patients are divided into three groups: (1) asymptomatic patients with or without persistent
      generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) syndrome; (2) patients with AIDS; and (3) patients who have
      or have had mild to moderate signs or symptoms consistent with HIV infection. Patients are
      then randomly chosen to receive one of three different foscarnet doses. The drug is given for
      4 weeks, by 1-hour infusion administered every 8 hours. In addition, those patients who are
      clinically stable and have not experienced severe toxicity at the end of the 4 weeks may
      continue treatment, in the form of a single daily dose of foscarnet to be administered 5 days
      per week. Blood samples are taken during treatment and at the first, fourth, and eighth week
      after treatment. If the patient is on maintenance, blood samples are taken weekly. Effective
      7-17-89, patients entering the study are assigned to the lowest foscarnet dose. Patients
      receive daily treatment for 28 days. Patients who are clinically stable without severe
      toxicity at 4 weeks have the option of maintenance therapy with foscarnet.
