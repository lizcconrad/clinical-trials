      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the efficacy of hydroxyurea with or without clotrimazole in terms of limiting the
      severity of anemia and the rate of hemolysis in patients with sickle cell anemia.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea and oral clotrimazole daily for 12 months.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 12 months. Patients are followed at 6
      weeks.
