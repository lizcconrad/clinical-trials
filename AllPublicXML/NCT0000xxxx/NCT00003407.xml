      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal
      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine and high-dose combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the effects of amifostine on the response to remission induction
      therapy and consolidation with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with poor prognosis
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed AML, and blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia
      (CML). II. Assess the effects of amifostine on the biology of AML and CML cells in vivo in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive treatment prior to induction therapy on protocols CYL 90-03 and CYL
      97-59. Induction therapy consists of amifostine IV on days 1 and 5 and three times a week
      from days 6 to 28. Fifteen minutes after amifostine on days 1 and 5, patients receive
      cytarabine IV over 3 hours at hour 0 and hour 12 and mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour at hour 15.
      Patients who do not enter remission receive a second course of induction therapy. Patients
      with persistent AML following a second course are removed from the study. Patients who
      achieve a complete response (CR), clinical CR, or remission in bone marrow but without
      hematologic recovery or who return to myelodysplastic syndrome receive consolidation therapy.
      Consolidation therapy consists of amifostine IV on days 1 and 5 and then three times a week
      until blood counts recover or day 30, whichever comes first. Patients also receive cytarabine
      and mitoxantrone as in induction therapy. Patients receive a second course of consolidation
      therapy beginning 1 week after blood counts recover. After completion of consolidation
      therapy, patients are enrolled on protocol MDS 97-53.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
