    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of the personal computer (PC) in occupational therapy. The
      results of the study will help occupational therapists develop improved treatment activities
      using PCs.

      Patients enrolled in various NIH clinical trials who are referred for occupational therapy
      may be eligible for this study. Each patient will have at least four computer sessions within
      6 months. They will use the PC to achieve goals they set for themselves-for example, to build
      work skills, improve concentration, or simply have fun. At the end of each session, the
      occupational therapist will interview the patient, asking, for example, about the goal of the
      session and what may have occurred during the session to make it more helpful or less
      helpful. The interviews will be tape recorded and used to help determine how computers may be
      used most therapeutically.

      Occupational therapy approaches rehabilitation through the concept of &quot;occupation&quot;, the
      component of human behavior regarding one's engagement in self-initiated, self-directed,
      adaptive, purposeful, culturally relevant, organized activity. Rehabilitation through
      occupation is a process, stemming from interactions among the three domains: (a) performance
      areas; (b) performance components; and (c) performance contexts. At the core of the
      occupational therapy is a sub-process created by patients and therapists through their
      actions and reactions to treatment. It is a significant sub-process because it sets into
      motion the use of occupation as therapy. It is believed that the appropriate, therapeutic use
      of occupation affects &quot;performance&quot; or how one functions.

      There is a need to develop ways to articulate and measure complex therapeutic interventions
      themselves. This is especially true of those treatment approaches which integrate human
      relationships, collaborative problem-solving, and the targeted doing of unique, personally
      relevant occupations. Occupational therapy is a health profession characterized by such
      interventions. The capacity to delineate key process variables may lead to credible
      examination of process-outcome relationships. Ultimately, results from the proposed study may
      provide information needed to further establish patient outcomes from occupational therapy
      interventions.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Men, women and children from across the United States and from around the world who
        participate in clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, and who have been
