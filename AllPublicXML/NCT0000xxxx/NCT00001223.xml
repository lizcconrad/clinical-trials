  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects many parts of the body, particularly the lungs and
      pancreas. The main purpose of this study is to further understand the natural history,
      clinical presentation, and genetics of cystic fibrosis.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis will be asked to participate in this study by undergoing
      standard medical tests and procedures. Patients will have a history taken and have a physical
      examination as well as blood tests, and a sweat test (a test for cystic fibrosis of the
      pancreas in which electrolytes are measured in collected sweat). Patients may also be asked
      to provide samples of urine, stool, and sputum for additional tests. More complicated
      procedures such as bronchoscopy or bronchoalveolar lavage may be required for diagnosis,
      treatment, or research purposes.

      Patients will receive appropriate treatment with antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins,
      physiotherapy, and other agents. Medications may be given by mouth or injected into a vein.

      This study will provide patients with information on the prognosis of the disease as well as
      recommendations for management of cystic fibrosis. In addition this study will provide
      information to researchers which may be useful in other studies of cystic fibrosis.

      This is an omnibus protocol for studying patients with cystic fibrosis and other familial

      pulmonary and pancreatic disorders. The main purpose of the study is to expand knowledge of
      the natural history, clinical manifestations (phenotypes) and the genetic variants
      (genotypes) of cystic fibrosis. A well-characterized population of patients with cystic
      fibrosis will be invited to provide appropriate specimens for laboratory research and to
      participate in clinical trials of therapeutic agents for cystic fibrosis.
