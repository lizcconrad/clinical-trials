      To make nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) available for treatment of HIV positive patients who
      are unable to take the three commercially available protease inhibitors (because of failure,
      intolerance, or contraindication) and who have a CD4 cell count of &lt;= 50. To obtain
      additional information on the safety profile of nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept).

      (PER AMENDMENT 1/8/97: People now qualify for the Viracept Program if they are unable to take
      indinavir and/or ritonavir due to intolerance, contraindication or prior failure.)
