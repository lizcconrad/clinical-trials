    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a new chemo radiotherapy regimen for the
      treatment of cancer of the head and neck for patients who have received induction
      chemotherapy; and to determine the highest dose of Taxotere which can be safely given
      together with radiotherapy.

      In this investigational research study investigators are attempting to develop a new chemo
      radiotherapy regimen in which radiotherapy and Taxotere will be combined after having
      received induction chemotherapy. Taxotere has never been given together with radiotherapy,
      the highest dose of Taxotere that can be safely used in this setting in unknown. Taxotere
      will be added to radiotherapy gradually as each subsequent group of 3-5 patients gets a
      larger dose. Taxotere doses will be increased until certain toxicities occur. This will help
      investigators determine the best way to combine Taxotere with radiotherapy and to use that
      knowledge to treat other patients with tumors like yours.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Pathology: Histologic documentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or
             its variants (lymphoepithelioma, undifferentiated epidermoid carcinoma, etc)

          -  Stage: Patients can be entered on this protocol after initial induction therapy, if
             prior to the induction regimen, they were previously untreated Stage III or IV (MO)
             SCCHN. This excludes patients with exophytic T3N0 tumors or T1N1 lesions at the onset
             of induction therapy. Evaluable disease during induction therapy is required.

             --Required Prior therapy: Patients entered on this protocol must have received therapy
             with one of the following induction regimens, except as modified for toxicity:

               -  PF: Cisplatin ≥ 80 mg/M2?course and FUra ≥ 1000 mg/M2/day for ≥ 4 days every ≤ 4
                  week

               -  CF: Carboplatinum ≥ 300 mg/M2/course and FUra ≥1000mg/M2/day for ≥4 days for ≤ 4
                  week

               -  PFL5: Cisplatin ≥ 25 mg/M2/day over 5 days, FUra ≥ 800mg/M2/day days 2-5 (4 days)
                  and Leucovorin ≥ 500 mg/M2/day over 5 days, every 4 weeks.

               -  TPF: Taxotere, Cisplatin ≥ 100 mg/M2/day over 5 days, FUra ≥ 700 mg/M2?day days
                  2-5 (4 days)

               -  Patients treated as above are eligible provided that they receive no more than
                  three cycles or, if not responding after 2 cycles; or 1 cycle with progressive
                  disease p. 35 of archive doc

          -  Other Malignancies:

               -  Patients with previous head and neck cancer are ineligible, except patients who
                  were treated with surgery as the sole modality 2 years prior to study entry.

               -  Patients with concurrent malignancy of any site, except limited basal cell
                  carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the
                  cervix are ineligible.
