    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma provide limited benefit to the patient. The
      anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the
      treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and bone
           marrow transplantation.

        -  Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous
      Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
      Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Non-Hodgkin's
           Lymphoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial
           response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
