  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of cidofovir (HPMPC) infusions in AIDS patients with
      relapsing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. To determine the time to retinitis progression in
      this patient population. To evaluate the impact of cidofovir therapy on visual acuity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive intravenous HPMPC either at one dose for both induction
      and maintenance or at a higher dose for induction than for maintenance. Induction consists of
      two consecutive weekly doses followed by maintenance every other week. All patients receive
      concomitant probenecid and saline hydration. Treatment continues until retinitis progression,
      as assessed by retinal photographs, or treatment-limiting toxicity occurs.
