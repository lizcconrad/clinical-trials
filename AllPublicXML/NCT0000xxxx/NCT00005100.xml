      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare growth hormone (GH) levels at baseline and after glucose suppression
      measured with both a polyclonal radioimmunoassay and a highly sensitive immunoradiometric
      assay (IRMA) in patients with acromegaly and normal volunteers.

      II. Measure the levels of IGF-I and its binding protein, IGFBP-3, in these cohorts.

      III. Determine any correlation between levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and GH suppressibility as
      assessed by sensitive IRMA.

      IV. Determine if patients who demonstrate biochemical features of mild GH excess are at risk
      for progression to active disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected and assessed for growth hormone and IGF-I by
      polyclonal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Growth hormone is
      measured at baseline and 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 100 g glucose drink. Serum glucose
      is measured at baseline and at 2 hours post dextrose administration by the glucose hexokinase
      method.

      Clinical scores are determined for headache, perspiration, fatigue, joint pain, and acne.

      Exams and tests may be repeated every 6 months for 2 years.
