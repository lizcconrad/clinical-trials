  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diverse clinical syndromes associated with hepatitis C underscore the multifactorial and
      polygenic nature of HCV infection. Both viral and host factors likely contribute to
      variations in infection outcome, disease susceptibility and progression, and treatment
      response. This protocol will focus on the immunogenetics of HCV infection. Various candidate
      genes, most of them related to host immune response in microbial infection, have defined
      genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with variable manifestations of infections
      including malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, AIDS and hepatitis B. In this proposal, we plan to
      collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a source of DNA from approximately 1500
      patients with HCV infection, analyze genetic polymorphisms of various candidate genes in
      association with viral clearance, disease progression or treatment response, and characterize
      the functional consequences of these polymorphisms in patients with well-defined clinical
      sequelae of HCV infection. We will also collect blood from patients with other forms of liver
      diseases (approximately 300) or normal volunteers (approximately 200) as controls. By
      identifying relevant host factors genetically and investigating their molecular interactions
      with HCV, we may gain additional insights into HCV pathogenesis and uncover new potential
      targets for vaccine development and treatment intervention.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who have recovered from past HCV exposure (positive anti-HCV but negative HCV
        viremia and absent liver disease).

        Patients with asymptomatic HCV infection (positive anti-HCV and HCV viremia, but
        persistently normal or minimally elevated ALT and normal or mild disease on liver biopsy).

        Patients with active liver disease (positive anti-HCV and HCV viremia, persistently
        elevated ALT and/or moderate disease on liver biopsy).

        Patients with active extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection (cryoglobulinemia,
        glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, etc.).

        Patients with rapidly progressive, severe liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.

        Patients who have undergone or are undergoing treatment.

        Patients from a single-source outbreak of HCV infections (in which the viral factors should
        be identical and the patients are often from a homogeneous population with less genetic
        variability).

        HCV infected family members and twins.

        Patients with other forms of liver disease including HBV infection, primary biliary
        cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, and
        Wilson's Disease, as well as normal volunteers.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adult subjects with a Hct of less than 30 or pediatric subjects less than 25 will be
        excluded.

        Children with HCV infection younger than 2 years of age will be excluded.

        Unaffected healthy volunteers who are minors are not eligible for this study.
