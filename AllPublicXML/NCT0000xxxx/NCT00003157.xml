      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy in
      treating patients who have cancer of the pancreas or stomach.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin that can be
      administered during a standard course of radiation therapy for patients with unresectable or
      locally recurrent pancreatic and gastric cancer. II. Describe the tolerance of gemcitabine,
      cisplatin, and radiation therapy in this patient population. III. Seek preliminary evidence
      of the therapeutic activity of this regimen in this patient population as measured by
      survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo radiotherapy to the tumor and
      lymph nodes, followed by a decrease in radiotherapy to the tumor alone. Radiation therapy is
      administered for a total of 5.5 weeks. Patients receive intravenous gemcitabine twice weekly
      on Tuesday and Friday over the first 3 weeks of radiotherapy. Cisplatin is administered
      intravenously twice weekly following gemcitabine therapy. Three patients are treated at each
      dose level. Dose escalation does not occur until all patients at a given dose level have
      completed radiotherapy and returned for a 4 week follow up. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
      is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience unacceptable toxic
      effects. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences DLT. Patients exhibiting stable disease remain on therapy until disease
      progression or intolerable toxic effects. Patients experiencing toxic effects and no disease
      progression are retreated at a lower dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first
      2 years then every 6 months for the next year.
