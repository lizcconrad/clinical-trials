      The purpose of this study is to see if adding stavudine (d4T) to anti-HIV drug regimens (with
      or without zidovudine, ZDV) can improve symptoms of AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC, problems
      involving the brain or spinal cord) in HIV-positive patients.

    <textblock>
      In this open-label, multicenter, multinational study, ZDV is replaced with d4T in
      ZDV-containing regimens, or d4T is added to non-ZDV-containing regimens in 20 patients
      experiencing ADC. Patients are defined as having failed treatment if they progress by one ADC
      stage on the MSK (Memorial Sloan Kettering) rating scale on study (i.e., from Stage 1 to 2 or
      Stage 2 to 3). Patients are evaluated on a weekly basis until the dementia deterioration is
      confirmed to be caused by HIV-1. The effect of d4T-containing regimens is assessed for the
      following parameters: neurological status, survival, AIDS-defining conditions, CSF
      (cerebrospinal fluid) and plasma viral load, CSF and blood immunological markers, blood CD4
      cell counts, and viral resistance. This study also assesses the pharmacokinetics of d4T in
      the CSF and in the blood.
