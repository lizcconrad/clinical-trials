      OBJECTIVES: I. Phase II trial to determine surgical morbidity of decompression coring,
      including any adverse events in the perioperative period and the rate of secondary medical or
      surgical interventions.

      II. Collect preliminary data to determine if decompression coring results in a substantial
      improvement in pain and mobility compared to conservative therapy in patients with avascular
      necrosis of the hip related to sickle cell disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to stage of avascular necrosis (I vs II vs III). Patients are randomized into one of two
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo a core biopsy and decompression of the hip followed by a standardized
      program of touch down or nonweight bearing with appropriate equipment and regular physical
      therapy for 6 weeks and then full weight bearing if tolerated.

      Arm II: Patients undergo the standardized ambulation and physical therapy program as in arm
      I. They do not undergo any surgical procedure.

      For 1 week prior to the beginning of the standardized program and during the 6 weeks of touch
      down or nonweight bearing, all patients complete a weekly pain and medication diary.

      Patients are followed at 3 months and 6 months, then every 6 months for 1.5 years, and then
      annually for up to 5 years.
