  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides a mechanism for evaluating patients for possible participation in NIDCR
      clinical research studies. NIDCR studies involve three major areas-pain, neurosensory
      mechanisms, and pain-relieving drugs-all of which have specific requirements and patient
      characteristics. No treatment is offered under this protocol; it is intended to facilitate
      patient recruitment into NIDCR studies.

      Patients with unusual or unknown conditions that have or have not been diagnosed may be
      eligible for this screening study. Specific medical criteria for enrollment vary with the
      particular protocol for which the individual is being screened. Medical and dental histories
      will be obtained and participants will have a dental examination. Diagnostic procedures will
      be done in accord with standard medical and dental practice and may include X-rays, blood
      tests, and routine urinalysis, as appropriate. Participants found eligible for an active
      study may enroll in that study. Those who are not eligible for a current study may be
      re-evaluated for future studies within a year if they wish. After 1 year, participants for
      whom no appropriate studies are identified will be referred back to their primary doctor or
      referring physician or dentist.

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to screen individuals with either third molars (&quot;wisdom teeth&quot;) in
      need of removal, or with chronic orofacial pain as potential research subjects.

      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process, including past
      medical history and an appropriate physical examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures
      and tests may also be completed in order to help determine a subject's eligibility. These
      tests and procedures are of minimal risks and will be described in more detail in section
      III: &quot;Study Procedures&quot;.

      Once the screening process is completed and eligibility determined, the subjects will be
      informed of their options to participate in one or more of the current NIDCR research
      studies. If no appropriate protocol is identified, recommendations for other treatment
      options may be given to the individual, their primary doctor, or referring physician/dentist.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Varies with the particular protocol for which a patient is being screened.

        Subjects with unusual or unknown conditions that require the establishment of a diagnosis,
        or those with an established diagnosis may be selected.

        Subjects source for this study will be from referrals by medical and dental practitioners
        in the private sector, clinics, hospitals, dental-medical institutions, Commissioned
        Officers Dental Clinic, and the Occupational Medical Services at the National Institutes of
        Health.
