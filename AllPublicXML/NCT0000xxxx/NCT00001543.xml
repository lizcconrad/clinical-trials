      This is a study investigating the hormones and substances important to the stress response.
      The hormone that is most directly responsible for stress response is called
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH is produced in the hypothalamus of the brain and
      causes the pituitary gland to produce another hormone called ACTH. The hormone ACTH then acts
      on the adrenal glands causing them to produce the hormone cortisol.

      Unfortunately, CRH levels are unable to be measured in simple blood samples. However,
      substances like cortisol and leptin can provide information as to the activity of the
      hypothalamus.

      The hormone leptin is associated with the regulation of body weight and the normal
      maintenance of bodily functions (homeostasis). It is found in fat cell (adipocyes) and
      communicates the nutritional status of the body to the brain (central nervous system).
      Research using animals has shown that defects in the communication between leptin and the
      brain causes obesity (the state of being overweight). It has also been noted that obese
      humans tend to have high levels of leptin.

      By studying patients with abnormal genes responsible for leptin production, researchers have
      found that a least one leptin gene must be intact for the normal secretion of hormones to
      proceed. These results show that the hormone leptin is produced outside of the brain in fat
      cells and acts directly on the function of the hypothalamus within the brain. Researchers
      believe that leptin plays a key role in the normal release of hormones from the HPA axis.

      Researchers intend on continuing to study the role of leptin in fat distribution, and the
      activity of the HPA axis in normal volunteers. In addition, this study will focus on the role
      of leptin in depression, because depression is characterized by changes in food intake, body
      weight, and neuroendocrine function. Data gathered from this study will provide a better
      understanding of the causes and medical consequences of major depression.

      Our group has tested the hypothesis that the molecules involved in the neurobiology of the
      stress response are key elements in the pathophysiology, treatment, and medical consequences
      of major depressive disorder. Leptin is implicated in the regulation of adipose tissue, body
      weight and homeostasis. In the first three years of this protocol we accomplished the
      following: (1) discovered leptin pulsatility; (2) showed that is secreted in a highly
      organized manner in men and women; (3) showed for the first time in humans an inverse
      relation between rapid fluctuations in plasma leptin concentrations in healthy volunteers and
      those of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol; (4) demonstrated a complex relation
      between the minute-to-minute dynamics of leptin and those of luteinizing hormone and
      estradiol; (5) showed a striking correlation between the 24-h dynamics of leptin and those of
      TSH and GH; (6) demonstrated highly significant correlation between hourly fluctuations of
      leptin levels and those of psychometric variables such as sadness, social withdrawal, and
      carbohydrate craving, and (7) showed that women produce twice as much leptin per secretory
      event than men. By studying patients with a leptin gene mutation we showed that at least one
      intact copy of the leptin gene is required for the regulation of TSH function and GH
      architecture in humans. These results indicate that leptin, a peripherally secreted molecule,
      appears to modulate the secretion of hypothalamic hormones. We have therefore proposed that
      hypothalamic neuroendocrine transduction, a key function of the CNS, may be regulated by
      leptin, a peripheral pulsatile signal of nutritional status. We would like to continue and
      expand our studies on the interactions of leptin, fat distribution, and the pituitary-adrenal
      axis in normal volunteers and also in patients with depression, because depression is
      characterized by alterations in food intake, body weight, and neuroendocrine function. Leptin
      profoundly affects the regulation of these three parameters. Leptin also increases insulin
      resistance, being therefore a risk factor for coronary artery disease, which is more
      prevalent and associated with higher mortality in depressed patients than in the general
      population. The data to be generated by this study will provide a better understanding of
      pathophysiology and medical consequences of major depression.
