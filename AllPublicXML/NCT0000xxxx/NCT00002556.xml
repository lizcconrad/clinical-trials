    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III clinical trial studies combination chemotherapy with high dose
      cyclophosphamide and recombinant interferon alfa-2b to see how well it works compared to
      combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with previously untreated stage I-III
      multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, carmustine,
      melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Recombinant
      interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet know whether
      giving combination chemotherapy with or without alternating high-dose cyclophosphamide and
      recombinant interferon alfa-2b is more effective in treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare response rate, time to response, duration of response, toxicity, and survival
      in the two regimens (vincristine sulfate, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, prednisone
      [VBMCP] vs. VBMCP alternating with high-dose cyclophosphamide and then with recombinant
      interferon alfa-2b [r alpha2b-IFN]) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma.

      II. To determine the value of the ancillary laboratory studies to predict response and
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive VBMCP comprising vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) on
      day 1, carmustine IV on day 1, melphalan orally (PO) on days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV on day
      1, and prednisone PO on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive VBMCP as in the induction phase. Courses repeat every 35 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive vincristine sulfate, carmustine, and melphalan as in the induction
      phase, high-dose cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4 and prednisone PO on days 1-4 during courses
      3 and 5. Patients receive VBMCP as in the induction phase during even numbered courses.
      Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10,
      12, 15, 17, 19, and 22 during odd courses beginning course 7. Treatment repeats every 35 days
      for courses 3-5, every 21 days for even courses beginning course 6, and every 22 days for odd
      courses beginning course 7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, treatment continues for up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; the following will constitute measurable
             disease; tests used to document measurable disease must be done within two weeks prior
             to registration; a bone marrow biopsy performed =&lt; 6 weeks prior to registration is
             acceptable; Note: If present, all of these parameters must be followed for response

          -  Serum M-protein &gt;= 1.0 g/dL by serum protein electrophoresis

          -  Urine M-protein (light chain) excretion &gt; 200 mg/24 hours by urine protein

          -  Patients requiring dialysis are not eligible

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  No myocardial infarction within previous 6 months, no significant arrhythmia within

          -  Patients with concurrent reversible conditions, e.g., infection, hyperuricemia, cord
             compression, hyperviscosity syndrome, central nervous system (CNS) complications, or
             renal disease may be entered into this study after appropriate therapy for these
             complications is initiated and the condition is controlled; therapy must be fully
             documented and dated on the on-study form; Note: Hypercalcemia patients may be entered
             directly on study and may receive corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, or other agents as
             needed for control of hypercalcemia; Note: Anemia patients may be entered directly on
             study and may receive erythropoietin (epoetin alfa: Procrit, Epogen, Aranesp, etc.) or

             disease free &gt; 5 years or patients whose only other malignancy is non-melanoma skin
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patients &gt;= 70 years must have a performance status of 0-2, and be specifically
             evaluated by their physician to determine if they can tolerate either regimen; they
             should not enter the study if the physician feels that they would be unable to
             tolerate either regimen

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             documented before entering this study; these patients must be provided adequate
