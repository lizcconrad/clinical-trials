      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical usefulness of preoperative irinotecan in patients with
      high risk, technically resectable metastatic colorectal cancer that is refractory to
      fluorouracil. II. Evaluate prospectively the relationship between expression of selected
      molecular determinants of response and clinical responsiveness to irinotecan in these
      patients. III. Determine the effect of treatment with irinotecan on the expression of
      putative response determinants in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly
      for 4 consecutive weeks. Course repeats every 6 weeks. After 2 courses, CT scan is obtained
      and patients showing evidence of disease that is still amenable to surgical resection undergo
      surgery. Approximately 4-8 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive 3 additional
      courses of irinotecan in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for years 3 and 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued into this study.
