      To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of 524W91 administered in
      HIV-infected patients. To determine the effects of food on bioavailability of 524W91.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive six single escalating doses of 524W91 or placebo, with
      each dose separated by at least a 6-day washout interval. In the time between 2 of the doses,
      the effect of food on pharmacokinetics will be investigated, with one dose administered in
      conjunction with a high-fat meal and one dose administered in a fasted state.
