  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique to gather information
      about brain function. It is very useful when studying the areas of the brain related to motor
      activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, spinal cord and nerve roots). The procedure is
      conducted by transmitting a magnetic signal into the brain to stimulate an area of the body.
      Electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) are used in order to measure
      electrical activity. A magnetic signal is sent from a metal instrument held close to the
      patient's head, to an area of the brain responsible for motor activity of a certain area of
      the body. The electrodes pick up and record the electrical activity in the muscles.

      This study will employ the use of TMS to diagnose neurological disorders that affect the
      motor cortex or the corticospinal tract. Normal subjects are sometimes studied to investigate
      normal activity of the nervous system and to train doctors in clinical neurophysiology and
      electrodiagnostic medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      This protocol outlines the use of magnetic stimulation as a diagnostic tool in patients with
      suspected dysfunction of central motor pathways or nerve roots and as a tool to localize and
      characterize suspected corticospinal abnormalities in neurologic disorders and systemic
      disorders with neurological manifestations. The protocol is intended for clinical use.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used for diagnosis of neurologic disorders since
      1987. The principles of magnetic stimulation and its use for diagnosis are described in
      current textbooks of clinical neurophysiology as a routine procedure and should be included
      in the training program for fellows in clinical neurophysiology and electrodiagnostic
      medicine at NIH.

      The magnetic stimuli are to be given as single or paired pulses at repetition rates less than
      1 per second.
