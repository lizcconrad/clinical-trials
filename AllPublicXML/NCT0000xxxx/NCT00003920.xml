      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more
      tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's
      normal tissues. Cyclosporine may prevent this from happening.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody plus
      cyclosporine and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have
      metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine variation in indium In 111 labeled 2IT-BAD monoclonal antibody 170
      (111In-2IT-BAD-m170) pharmacokinetics before and with each therapy in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine each therapeutic dose of yttrium Y 90 labeled 2IT-BAD
      monoclonal antibody 170 (90Y-2IT-BAD-m170) based on the calculated radiation dosimetry for
      normal nonmarrow tissues from the pharmacokinetic study with 111In-2IT-BAD-m170 performed
      prior to each therapy course in these patients. III. Determine the maximum tolerated,
      nonmarrow, normal tissue dose (MTNTD) of 90Y-2IT-BAD-m170 for these patients when up to 3
      courses with cyclosporine plus autologous peripheral stem cell support are given every 3
      months. IV. Evaluate the safety of and tumor response to 111In/90Y-2IT-BAD-m170 therapy with
      cyclosporine and autologous peripheral stem cells at the MTNTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 labeled 2IT-BAD monoclonal antibody
      170 (90Y-2IT-BAD-m170). Patients are stratified according to risk based on prior therapy
      (standard combined chemotherapy vs standard and high dose combined chemotherapy with bone
      marrow transplant or stem cell support). All patients receive subcutaneous filgrastim (G-CSF)
      during stem cell collection. Beginning 3 to 5 days after starting G-CSF, patients undergo
      apheresis either daily or every other day for 4 to 8 procedures. Patients receive oral
      cyclosporine twice daily, starting on day 1, for up to 2 weeks. On day 4, patients receive
      nonlabeled 2IT-BAD monoclonal antibody m170 IV over 10-15 minutes, followed 15 minutes later
      by indium In 111 labeled 2IT-BAD monoclonal antibody 170 (111In-2IT-BAD-m170) IV over 10-15
      minutes. Patients then undergo dosimetry imaging immediately, again 3 hours later, and then
      on days 1-4 and day 7 postinjection. Patients receive nonlabeled monoclonal antibody IV over
      10-15 minutes, followed 15 minutes later by In 111/Y 90 labeled 2IT-BAD monoclonal antibody
      170 (111In/90Y-2IT-BAD-m170) IV over 10-15 minutes, then undergo imaging as in pretherapy.
      Patients also receive cyclosporine, administered as in pretherapy, for a total of 35 days,
      plus autologous stem cell support followed by G-CSF after each course. Cohorts of 3-9
      patients receive escalating doses of 111In/90Y-2IT-BAD-m170. Patients proceed to the next
      dose level if 3 or more patients in the same or higher risk group have not reached the
      maximum tolerated, nonmarrow, normal tissue dose (MTNTD) at least 3 months after the second
      course of therapy. Therapy repeats every 3 months for 3 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
