  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy and tolerability
      of combining a selected dose of SC-48334 with low-dose AZT in the treatment of symptomatic
      HIV+ patients with 200 to 500 CD4+ cells/mm3.

      The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of both
      SC-48334 and AZT, when administered together, in symptomatic HIV+ patients with 200 - 500
      CD4+ cells/mm3.
