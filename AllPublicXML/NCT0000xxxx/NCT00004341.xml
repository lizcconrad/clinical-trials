      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify the molecular defects responsible for primary immunodeficiency
      disorders.

      II. Explore the mutations within each syndrome to better understand the genetics of these
      disorders.

      III. Study the function of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP). IV. Design methods
      to identify carriers and for prenatal diagnosis. V. Explore new avenues for therapy.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are studied systematically to determine the extent of their immune
      deficiency and to confirm a specific diagnosis. Patients with a known immunodeficiency
      syndrome are studied in detail to identify the gene mutation, to assess the effect of the
      mutation on the gene product, and to establish cell lines for further in vitro assessment of
      the genetic defect. The function of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP) in hematopoietic
      cells is studied.

      Family members of patients with X-linked disorders are studied to identify carrier females.
