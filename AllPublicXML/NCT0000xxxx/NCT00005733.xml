      BACKGROUND:

      Asthma is a serious chronic disease affecting about 12 million Americans; about 3 million are
      children. The study was part of an initiative, &quot;Developing and Implementing at the State and
      Local Level Educational Strategies and Interventions for Controlling Asthma in Inner City and
      High Risk Populations&quot;, released in February 1993 by the National Asthma Education Program of
      the Office of Prevention, Education and Control.
