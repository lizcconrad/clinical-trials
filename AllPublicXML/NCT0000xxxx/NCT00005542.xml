      environmental risk factors interact to cause sarcoidosis.

      BACKGROUND:

      Sarcoidosis is a rare systemic granulomatous disease that mainly affects young to middle aged
      adults, and more severely affects African Americans than Caucasians. The etiology of
      sarcoidosis is not yet known, and epidemiological studies have only identified general risk
      factors including age, sex, race, and family history. Sarcoidosis may also be influenced by
      environmental factors, although the particular environmental agents have not yet been clearly
      defined. While previous studies have provided evidence for familial clustering, little is
      known about the genes that influence predisposition to sarcoidosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a multicenter consortium genetic epidemiology study. The investigators will
      accomplish their goal by organizing a 10-site multi-center consortium to recruit an adequate
      sample of sarcoidosis families for analysis. They plan to use the affected sibling pair
      linkage analysis to scan the genome for linked chromosomal regions, transmission
      disequilibrium testing to evaluate candidate genes in those regions with evidence for
      linkage, and an environmental questionnaire to collect data to test for possible interactions
      of susceptibility genes with exogenous risk factors. Genotyping and analysis of data are
      scheduled to begin in July, 2001 with completion of all analysis by April, 2004.

      The study consists of a Clinical Core, a Data Coordinating Core, and a Genetics Core with a
      DNA Processing Center and a Genotyping Center. Eight of the ten clinical centers comprising
      the Clinical Core are members of the ACCESS, A Case Control Etiology of Sarcoidosis Study.
