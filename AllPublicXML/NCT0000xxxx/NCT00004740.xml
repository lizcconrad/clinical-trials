      OBJECTIVES: I. Recruit 300 injection drug users with positive tuberculin skin tests who are
      candidates for isoniazid chemoprophylaxis into a trial of several interventions to enhance
      adherence to preventive therapy.

      II. Compare the effectiveness of self-administered isoniazid chemoprophylaxis supplemented
      with peer education and support groups versus directly observed preventive therapy delivered
      by a licensed nurse versus self-administered therapy with standard clinic follow-up and
      education. Outcome measures are adherence to prescribed doses of medication and the
      proportion of patients who complete therapy.

      III. Compare the impact of monetary incentives on therapy adherence by random assignment to
      immediate vs. deferred financial incentive.

      IV. Assess attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about tuberculosis and preventive therapy in
      these patients and determine the association of these factors with demographic, social, and
      clinical characteristics.

      V. Assess attitudes and beliefs about tuberculosis susceptibility, seriousness, benefits of
      preventive therapy, barriers to therapy, and self-efficacy as predictors of health-related
      behaviors as measured by adherence with therapy, and determine the impact of the assigned
      interventions on these attitudes and beliefs.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients in the first group self-administer
      oral isoniazid following the standard clinic protocol for 6 months. They receive individual
      counseling and education by a peer educator at entry and at week 2, participate in a monthly
      support group cofacilitated by a peer counselor and health educator, and make a monthly
      clinic visit.

      Patients in the second group receive oral isoniazid twice a week. Therapy is administered by
      the nurse, who observes ingestion and swallowing. Nursing education and support per standard
      clinic procedures is provided at each monthly clinic visit.

      Patients in the third group self-administer oral isoniazid, without enhanced education and
      peer support, following the standard clinic protocol for 6 months. Nursing education and
      support per standard clinic procedures is provided at each monthly clinic visit.

      Within each group, patients are randomly assigned to an immediate or deferred financial
      compensation schedule. Immediate compensation for compliance with medication and clinical
      visit is given during the monthly clinic visit, while deferred compensation is given at study
      completion.

      It is recommended that HIV-seropositive patients receive 6 additional months of standard
      isoniazid therapy.
