      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether vestibular rehabilitation training is of value in reducing anxiety
      symptoms in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia who have vestibular
      dysfunction as identified by clinical vestibular tests.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: During the first 4 weeks of study, patients meet with a clinical nurse
      specialist once a week for approximately 1 hour. During this time, the nature of the anxiety
      disorder is explained and exposure to previously feared situations is encouraged.

      Only patients who remain symptomatic at a stable level following self-exposure will proceed
      with rehabilitation training.

      Patients meet with a physical therapist once a week for 4 weeks to further evaluate the
      extent of problems associated with balance. Then, patients undergo weekly 1 hour exercises
      for 8 weeks with the physical therapist, focusing on sensation, head and eye coordination,
      movement with eyes opened and closed, and gait.

      Concurrently, patients meet with the clinical nurse specialist every 4 weeks during and after
      physical therapy to evaluate the effects of vestibular treatment on anxiety symptoms.

      Training is continued if patient is symptomatic; otherwise, patient is discharged from study.
