      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating anaplastic
      large cell lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying several different regimens of
      combination chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating children with anaplastic
      large cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the event-free survival in children with anaplastic large cell lymphoma treated
           with various induction and maintenance chemotherapy regimens with or without
           vinblastine.

        -  Compare the impact of different doses and schedules of methotrexate from the
           Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-K2 Protocol in terms of overall survival, complete remission
           rate, CNS relapse rate, and nonlymphoma-related death and early death rates in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      country, vinblastine (VBL) (yes vs no), and prognostic factors (standard-risk (SR) vs
      high-risk (HR) disease).

      Beginning immediately after confirmation of diagnosis, patients receive prephase therapy
      comprising dexamethasone (DM) IV or orally daily on days 1 and 2 and every 12 hours on days
      3-5; cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2; and methotrexate (MTX)
      intrathecally (IT), doxorubicin (DOX) IV, and hydrocortisone (HC) IT on day 1.

      Patients are then assigned to one of two treatment groups based on prognosis:

        -  Group 1 (SR disease): Patients are randomized to arm I or III:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment on arm I as defined below on day 1, and then the
                following courses as defined below in the following order beginning on day 6: A1,
                B1, A2, B2, A3, and B3.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive treatment on arm III as defined below on day 1, and then
                the following courses as defined below in the following order beginning on day 6:
                regimen AM1, BM1, AM2, BM2, AM3, and BM3.

        -  Group 2 (HR disease):

             -  First randomization: Patients are randomized to arm I or III:

                  -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment on arm I as defined below on day 1 and then
                     course A1 as defined below on day 6.

                  -  Arm III: Patients receive treatment on arm III as defined below on day 1 and
                     then course AM1 as defined below on day 6.

             -  Second randomization: Patients without disease progression after completion of the
                above therapy are randomized to arm I, II, III, or IV.

                  -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment on arm I as defined below on day 1, and then
                     the following courses as defined below in the following order after blood
                     counts recover: B1, A2, B2, A3, and B3.

                  -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment on arm II as defined below on day 1, and
                     then the following courses as defined below in the following order after blood
                     counts recover: BV1, AV2, BV2, AV3, and BV3.

                  -  Arm III: Patients receive treatment on arm III as defined below on day 1, and
                     then the following courses as defined below in the following order after blood
                     counts recover: BM1, AM2, BM2, AM3, and BM3.

                  -  Arm IV: Patients receive treatment on arm IV as defined below on day 1, and
                     then the following courses as defined below in the following order after blood
                     counts recover: BMV1, AMV2, BMV2, AMV3, and BMV3.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
