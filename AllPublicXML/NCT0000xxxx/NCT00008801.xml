  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long-term goal of this proposal is to improve the results and applicability of
      islet allotransplantation early in the course of type 1 diabetes through the administration
      of selective and short-term immunotherapy. More specifically, the objectives of these studies
      is to conduct an open-labeled, one-year follow-up Phase I/II study in patients with surgical
      and type 1 diabetes to determine the safety, tolerability, immune activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) administration for the prevention of autoimmune
      destruction and rejection of allogeneic islet transplants.

      Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the first year post-transplant. The
      proportion of surgical and type 1 diabetic subjects receiving an islet allotransplant who
      achieve and maintain full or partial islet graft function during the first year
      post-transplant will be determined to assess the efficacy of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala)
      administration. Successful completion of the proposed clinical trial will increase our
      understanding of the safety, efficacy and underlying mechanisms of selective immunotherapy
      with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) for the maximization of
      engraftment and functional survival of allogeneic human islets in surgical and type 1
      diabetic recipients.
