  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukodystrophy is a disease of the white matter of the brain. White matter is the portion of
      the brain responsible for conducting electrical impulses from one area of the brain to the
      other. Insulating cells called myelin cover the brain and nerve cells in the white matter. If
      myelin becomes damaged electrical information cannot be transferred properly.

      Many patients suffering from leukodystrophies do not fit the description of any of the
      defined types of leukodystrophies and are therefore considered to have a leukodystrophy of
      unknown cause.

      The purpose of this study is to define groups of patients with leukodystrophies and to work
      toward finding the cause of the disorders. In order to do this, researchers will analyze
      patients with leukodystrophies of unknown causes. Patients will undergo clinical,
      neurophysiologic, biochemical, and genetic examinations and tests.

      Researchers believe that by studying these patients and their disorders they will be able to
      better understand the causes of myelin destruction, and eventually lead to effective
      treatments for these disorders.

      Patients with leukodystrophies (LDs) of unknown etiology are a heterogeneous group but
      constitute the second largest group of genetic white matter diseases. The purpose of this
      study is to: (a) define novel homogeneous groups of patients with LDs and (b) work toward
      finding the cause of these disorders. In order to achieve these goals, patients with LDs of
      unknown cause will be analyzed clinically, neurophysiologically, biochemically and
      genetically. Patients would have been diagnosed as having no known leukodystrophies at
      outside centers. At the Clinical Center, such patients will undergo a series of
      neuropsychological, blood, urine, spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue
      pathological tests. Some of these tests will be part of a standard battery while others will
      be tailored to individual patients. Patients will be followed for 3 years. Patients will be
      screened for mutations in genes coding for structural myelin proteins. In some patients in
      whom all tests yielded no information regarding the etiology of their disease, open brain
      biopsy will be considered. Brain biopsy tissue will be evaluated using a novel combination of
      approaches including detailed pathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of
      myelin proteins and lipids. Oligodendroglial biology and expression of myelin genes in the
      brain will also be investigated in situ. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify
      the nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of these diseases.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Candidates for participation in the protocol will be patients of all ages with
                  clinical and radiographic signs of leukodystrophy who do not have a specific
                  etiology despite a previous comprehensive workup. The preceding investigation
                  would have excluded the following: adrenoleukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy,
                  metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, a well-defined
                  amino acid organic acid disorder, or a systemic mitochondrial cytopathy.

               2. First -degree relatives of patients with leukodystrophies of unknown etiology
                  (father, mother, siblings, or sons and daughters of the patients)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Refusal to sign the protocol consent form.

          2. Candidates who are unable to travel to the National Institutes of Health Clinical
             Center.
