      OBJECTIVES:

      Determine whether copies of the cystic fibrosis gene (pGT-1) can be delivered to the cells
      lining the nose of cystic fibrosis patients using cationic liposome (DMRIE/DOPE) mediated
      gene transfer.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Under direct visualization, patients receive lipid/DNA formulation (pGT-1
      lipid complex) by syringe instillation over 30 minutes to the right inferior nasal turbinate.

      Patients are followed daily for 7 days, twice a week for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10
      weeks, then every 3 months thereafter.
