      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have
      lymphoproliferative disorder that is associated with immunosuppression therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative
      disorders while under pharmacologic immune suppression for control of either allograft
      rejection or autoimmune disease. II. Evaluate the safety and direct toxicity of rituximab in
      this patient population, including the potential for opportunistic infections. III. Evaluate
      the secondary consequences of rituximab therapy in this population, including changes in the
      requirement for immunosuppressive drugs, effects on graft rejection, graft survival, and
      severity of autoimmune disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV over several hours. Treatment repeats every week for 4
      courses. Patients are followed every month for 6 months, and then every 3 months until
      relapse or 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
