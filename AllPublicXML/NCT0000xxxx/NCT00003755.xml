      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of Ro 31-7453 in treating patients who have
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of Ro 31-7453 in patients with solid
      tumors. II. Determine the toxicity of Ro 31-7453 in this patient population. III. Evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics and major metabolites of Ro 31-7453 in these patients. IV. Assess any
      antitumor activity of Ro 31-7453 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are treated on one of two treatment arms.
      In the first stage, cohorts of 1 patient each on arm I receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on
      days 1-4, and cohorts of 1 patient each on arm II receive oral Ro 31-7453 once daily on days
      1-4 at two dose levels higher than for arm I. Dose escalation ceases for each arm with the
      first instance of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Two additional patients are entered at the
      stopping dose for each arm. If no further DLT occurs, the study proceeds to the second stage.
      In the second stage, dose escalation continues in increments of one dose level for each
      dosing schedule (arms I and II). Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Ro
      31-7453 in the absence of DLT. If 2 of 6 patients experience DLT at a dose level, escalation
      ceases and the maximum tolerated dose is defined as the previous dose level. Treatment
      continues every 3 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After completion of the 8 courses, patients may continue treatment until disease
      progression at the discretion of the investigator and the study sponsor. Patients are
      followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
