      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who
      have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's
      disease treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of
      bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine duration of response and survival in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous IV infusion over 72 hours. Courses
      repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for at
      least 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are treated with 4 additional
      courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
