      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of COL-3 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Define the maximum tolerated dose of COL-3 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. II. Identify the dose limiting toxicity and safety profile of COL-3 in these
      patients. III. Define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COL-3 in these patients.
      IV. Observe any evidence of antitumor activity through standard response criteria or biologic
      surrogate markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral COL-3 once daily. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxic effects. Cohorts of
      3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of COL-3. Dose escalation to the next level occurs
      after 3 patients have completed 28 days of treatment without dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
      Dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued within 1 year for this study.
