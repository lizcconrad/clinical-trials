      RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells.
      This may be an effective treatment for malignant glioma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of immunotoxin therapy in treating
      patients who have malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of interstitial
           interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin in patients with malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall survival,
           and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug at the MTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy of brain tumor followed by CT guided stereotactic
      placement of 2 intratumoral catheters on day 0. Patients with histologically confirmed
      malignant glioma receive interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin interstitially over 96 hours
      beginning on day 1. Patients with a residual enhancing mass undergo repeat catheter placement
      on day 56 and then receive a second interstitial infusion beginning on day 57 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study within 6
      months and a total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within 10-12
      months.
