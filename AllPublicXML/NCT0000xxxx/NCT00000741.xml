  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of methylprednisolone on respiratory failure in HIV-infected patients
      with presumed or confirmed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who are stratified for presence or
      absence of respiratory failure at the time of randomization to the study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected children are randomized to receive adjunctive therapy with intravenous
      methylprednisolone or placebo. Treatment is administered for 10 days. Primary
      antipneumocystis therapy with TMP/SMX or systemic pentamidine is selected by the individual
      investigator and given for 21 days. Patients are stratified at the time of randomization by
      the presence or absence of respiratory failure.
