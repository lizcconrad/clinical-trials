    <textblock>
      This study will try to determine what causes learning, behavioral and emotional problems in
      children with chronic granulomatous disease (GCD) and other phagocyte disorders. (Phagocytes
      are a type of white blood cell.) Children with these disorders have frequent severe
      infections that require hospitalization, sometimes for long periods of time. Many of them
      also have problems with school, learning, behavior, anxiety and depression. This study will
      explore whether these latter problems are a direct result of the illness itself or are a
      consequence of frequent, long hospitalizations, or are due to other factors. Test findings in
      these children will be compared with those of children with cystic fibrosis-another disease
      that causes frequent infections requiring prolonged hospitalization.

      Patients age 2 or older with GCD or other phagocytic disorders or cystic fibrosis may be
      eligible for this study. Participants (or a parent or guardian) will complete questionnaires
      including personal information such as age, gender and marital status, a family medical
      history, and information on their illness. Patients will be given various psychological and
      intelligence tests, and they and their parents or guardians will be interviewed by a child
      psychiatrist. The tests and interviews take a total of about 5 hours and are given in two or
      three separate sessions.

      The tests may reveal problems such as learning disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder, anxiety, or depression. If any of these problems are identified, appropriate
      referrals will be made for specialized services, such as special school placement, tutoring,
      or counseling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukocyte disorders are predominantly genetic diseases in which phagocytes fail to function
      normally resulting in recurrent infections. Children with these disorders are subject to
      recurrent, severe, often life-threatening infections and are hospitalized more frequently
      than their peers. Frequent hospitalization and chronic illness can affect growth,
      development, socialization, and educational opportunities.

      Specifically, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder in which
      phagocytes fail to generate an oxidative burst. In 26 patients followed at the NIH tested for
      behavioral problems at the request of a parent or staff member, we have observed a 23% rate
      of mild mental retardation. However, it is not clear whether this is due to CGD per se or the
      recurrent infections and hospitalizations. We seek to determine the prevalence of cognitive
      disabilities in children with CGD and other leukocyte disorders. We seek to determine whether
      abnormal leukocyte functioning may be related to specific behavioral phenotypes or impaired
      cognitive functioning. We also seek to clarify whether impaired cognitive functioning is
      related to the effects of frequent and prolonged hospitalization or other variables such as
      severity of illness in this population.
