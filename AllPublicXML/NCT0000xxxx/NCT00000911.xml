  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor patients who recently have been infected with HIV in
      order to learn how their immune systems respond to HIV infection and to study how the virus
      acts in their bodies.

      Primary HIV infection occurs within 20 days to 8 weeks following exposure to HIV. The
      symptoms of primary HIV infection are usually fever, tiredness, headache, or muscle aches.
      However, symptoms vary greatly from person to person, and some people might not experience
      any symptoms at all. Because these symptoms also resemble the cold or the flu, it is
      difficult to identify patients with primary HIV infection. Information gathered from this
      study will help doctors decide what kind of treatment is best to give patients who recently
      have been infected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary HIV-1 infection is frequently identified as a nonspecific viral syndrome occurring
      within 20 days to 8 weeks following a documented HIV exposure. However, symptoms vary from
      person to person, and some people undergo asymptomatic seroconversion. Because of the
      difficulty identifying patients with either acute HIV infection (within 30 days of initial
      infection) or early infection (within 12 months of initial infection), no systematic review
      of viral dynamics or immunodynamics in this patient population has been undertaken. A better
      understanding of the virologic and immunologic parameters during acute and early HIV
      infection should provide information relevant to the optimal design of future clinical
      therapeutic trials.

      The only patient intervention is obtaining blood, lymph node tissue, CSF, and semen or
      vaginal secretion specimens at designated intervals according to the schedule of evaluations.
      Patients are followed for 5 years. Patients may elect to start or discontinue antiretroviral
      therapy at any time; however, no antiretroviral therapy is administered as part of this
      study. Descriptive analysis includes tolerance and toxicity, magnitude and durability of RNA
      suppression, magnitude and durability of immunologic responses (CD4 and CD8 cells), and decay
      and emergence of resistant virus in tissue reservoirs (CSF, genital secretions, and lymph
      nodes).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are at least 13 years old (consent of parent or guardian required if under 18).

          -  Have acute or early HIV infection. The stage of HIV infection will depend on the
             results of certain lab tests.
