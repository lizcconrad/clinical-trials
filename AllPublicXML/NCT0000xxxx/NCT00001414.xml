  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research involving families, twins, and adoption all support the idea that there is
      a substantial heritable aspect to personality.

      The goal of this research study is to determine how genetics influence heritable personality
      traits. The work will focus on how genetics affect the chemical messengers which brain cells
      use to communicate with each other (neurotransmitters).

      The study involves collecting personality data and DNA samples from related individuals,
      primarily male siblings and female siblings, but also including parents. Genetic tests
      performed on these samples will continue to focus on variations in genes, which potentially
      effect brain neurotransmission.

      This research has the potential to advance knowledge of genetic influences on human behavior
      that may be relevant both to normal personality and to psychopathology.

      Building on family, twin and adoption studies suggesting that substantial aspects of
      personality are heritable, research under this protocol explores potential genetic influences
      on normal personality dimensions. We have previously reported associations between variation
      in neurotransmitter system genes and variation in personality traits, both across and within
      families, in a sample of the general population. This study involves collecting personality
      data and DNA samples from related individuals, primarily male siblings and female siblings,
      but also including parents. Genetic tests performed on these samples will continue to focus
      on variations in genes, which potentially affect brain neurotransmission. In some cases,
      participants are recontacted to specifically investigate whether identified variations in
      neurotransmitter system genes actually affect neurotransmission. Large population samples are
      needed in this research, particularly since a new epidemiologically standard population
      sample will be obtained. This research has the potential to advance knowledge of genetic
      influences on human behavior that may be relevant both to normal personality and to
      psychopathology.
