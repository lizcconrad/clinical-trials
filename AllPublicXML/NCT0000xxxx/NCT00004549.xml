      This study will examine the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting blood vessel
      inflammation. The results of this study may later be applied to diagnosing inflammation of
      arteries in patients with atherosclerosis, predicting disease progression in these patients,
      and guiding therapy.

      Patients with peripheral artery disease (for example, blockage of a leg artery) undergoing
      balloon angioplasty at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, may be eligible to
      participate in this study. Because this procedure, which opens blocked arteries, can cause
      inflammation in the vessel wall, it affords an opportunity for studying MRI detection of such
      inflammation.

      Study candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination.
      Participants will have a MRI scan and blood drawn at Suburban Hospital before the angioplasty
      and again either 1 to 3 days or 2 weeks after the procedure. Before the MRI scan is begun, a
      catheter (a thin plastic tube) is inserted in an arm vein and 90 milliliters (about 3 ounces)
      of blood is drawn. The patient then lies on a table that slides into the MRI scanner-a large
      donut-shaped machine with a magnetic field. A flexible, padded sensor called an MRI coil is
      placed over the area to be imaged; this device is used to improve the quality of the
      pictures. During the scan a contrast material called gadolinium is injected through the
      catheter. Gadolinium brightens the image of the blood vessels. The procedure lasts up to 2
      hours.

      In this pilot study high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to study 20
      patients scheduled to undergo peripheral angioplasty in order to determine the MRI
      characteristics of acute and chronic vascular inflammation. The vascular territories to be
      angioplastied will be imaged in 20 patients with peripheral vascular disease prior to
      angioplasty. Patients will then be randomly assigned for imaging at 24-72 hours (10 patients)
      or imaging at 2-4 weeks (10 patients) post-angioplasty. Analysis will focus on paired
      comparisons between pre- and post-angioplasty data within each group. This study should
      provide data that can be applied to other research protocols designed to image inflammation
      associated with vascular injury and atherosclerosis.
