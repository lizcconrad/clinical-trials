      RATIONALE: Immunotoxins such as denileukin diftitox can locate cancer cells and kill them
      without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of denileukin diftitox in treating
      patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with previously treated
      stage I, II, III, or IV low- or intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with
      denileukin diftitox. II. Determine the time to progression, duration of remission, and time
      to treatment failure in patients after treatment with this therapy. III. Determine the
      toxicity of this therapy in these patients. IV. Correlate the results of the inteleukin-2
      receptor assay with treatment outcomes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to interleukin-2 receptor classification (positive
      vs negative). Patients receive immunotoxin therapy with denileukin diftitox IV over 15-60
      minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for the interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      receptor-positive stratum and a total of 11-44 patients will be accrued for the IL-2
      receptor-negative stratum.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage I, II, III, or IV low- or
        intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Small lymphocytic Follicular small cleaved
        cell Follicular mixed cell Follicular large cell Marginal Diffuse large B-cell
        Lymphoplasmacytoid Patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma must have an absolute
        lymphocyte count less than 10,000/mm3 At least one bidimensionally measurable site At least
        1.5 cm in its greatest dimension Not in field of prior radiotherapy Progressive disease
        after at least one prior treatment regimen for lymphoma A new classification scheme for
        adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or
        &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or
        &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: See Disease Characteristics Absolute neutrophil count at least

        greater than ULN Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective
        contraception HIV negative No active infection requiring anti-infective therapy No other
        prior invasive malignancy within past 5 years, except: Curatively treated basal cell or
        squamous cell skin cancer Carcinoma in situ of the cervix

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Prior stem cell transplantation allowed At
        least 4 weeks since prior biologic therapy No other concurrent immunotherapy Chemotherapy:
        At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: At
        least 4 weeks since prior endocrine therapy No concurrent hormonal therapy (except
        contraceptives and replacement steroids) No concurrent corticosteroids Radiotherapy: See
        Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy for localized disease No
        concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: Not specified Other: No other concurrent experimental
