      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of muJ591 monoclonal antibody in treating
      patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Define the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody muJ591
      in patients with hormone independent prostate cancer. II. Define the pharmacokinetics and
      biodistribution of monoclonal antibody muJ591 in these patients. III. Define the human
      antimouse antibody response to this therapy. IV. Define the preliminary efficacy of this
      therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive a single dose of intravenous
      iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody muJ591 on day 0, combined with an unlabeled (cold)
      dose of monoclonal antibody muJ591. Anterior and posterior imaging is obtained 1 hour after
      labeled muJ591 administration and on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. Subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive fixed iodine-labeled doses with escalating cold doses of monoclonal antibody muJ591
      until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Patients are followed for a minimum of 8 weeks
      after muJ591 therapy or until disease progression. Patients with stable or responding disease
      who are human anti-mouse antibody negative may receive subsequent treatments at the
      discretion of the principal investigator.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
