      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug or giving the drugs in different ways
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy administered
      via an implantable pump with a subcutaneous port for unresectable liver metastases in
      patients with resected primary colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of 2 schedules of fluorouracil/leucovorin given as a
      continuous intra-arterial infusion via an implantable pump vs. a subcutaneous port for
      unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. II. Compare the effect of
      each treatment on response rate, quality of life, and rate of technical complications in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CF Leucovorin calcium, NSC-3590
      5-FU Fluorouracil, NSC-19893 Arm I: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. 5-FU;
      with CF. Weekly infusion via an implantable pump. Arm II: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug
      Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Weekly infusion via a subcutaneous infusion port. Arm III:
      Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Monthly infusion via an
      implantable pump. Arm IV: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF.
      Monthly infusion via a subcutaneous infusion port.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 336 patients will be entered in this multicenter study.
