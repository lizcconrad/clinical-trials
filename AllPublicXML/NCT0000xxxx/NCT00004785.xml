      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of dexamethasone (DM) vs. DM/methylprednisolone treatment
      vs. placebo, initiated within the first month of life, on long-term pulmonary and
      developmental outcomes in premature infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      II. Compare the toxicities of these treatments. III. Assess treatment effects on adrenal
      function.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomly assigned to
      1 of 3 treatment groups. The first group receives intravenous dexamethasone tapered over 42
      days.

      The second group receives daily intravenous dexamethasone for 6 days, then intravenous
      methylprednisolone (MePRDL) tapered over the next 34 days, beginning on day 8. A placebo is
      given on &quot;off&quot; MePRDL days.

      The third group receives an intravenous placebo for 42 days, with a tapering schedule
      beginning day 35.

      All patients may receive 6 days of dexamethasone rescue therapy beginning day 15 and/or 30,
      as clinically indicated. Study drugs are suspended during rescue therapy.
