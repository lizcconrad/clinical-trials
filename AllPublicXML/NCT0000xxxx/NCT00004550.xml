  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the long-term progress of people with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related conditions such as anorexia nervosa, Tourette
      syndrome, and trichotillomania.

      This study involves the screening and follow-up of individuals with OCD and OCD-related
      disorders. Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation,
      questionnaires, and neurological testing. Participants will then have study visits every 4 to
      12 weeks to undergo symptom and daily functioning evaluations, personality tests, blood and
      urine tests, memory tests, brain scans, and other clinical exams. Participants will be
      assessed with interviews and paper-and-pencil or computer-assisted tests. Participants may
      have the opportunity to participate in drug studies and to join a monthly OCD support group.
      At the end of the study, participants will be referred to community or private treatment
      centers.

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for careful screening and follow-up of patients with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and OCD-related disorders for a variety of protocols,
      recording demographic and rating information over the long-term course of the OCD illness and
      associated anxiety and depression symptoms. Patients in this study will be asked to
      participate in the naturalistic baseline assessment phase to better understand the
      pathophysiology and long-term course of illness. As a part of this protocol, subjects will be
      systematically administered assessment measures including diagnostic and psychological
      screening tests, a psychiatric assessment, SCID I and SCID II interviews, as well as other
      rating scales. They will also be informed of their opportunity to participate in research
      procedures such as blood draws and MRI of the brain. Upon conclusion of their participation,
      they will be referred out to community/private treatment when appropriate. All will be
      offered participation in an ongoing support group. This protocol will serve as an entry point
      for individuals with OCD and OCD-related disorders to proceed into other investigation
      procedures.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals must be capable of decision making, and able to comprehend the purpose of the
        study and to provide informed consent.

        Individuals can be included if they have certain medical conditions that have been
        described to have a higher incidence of OCD/depression and anxiety disorders: e.g.,
        individuals with underlying neurological or neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., tic
        disorders or dystonias, including torticollis and blepharospasm), connective tissue
        disorders, but must show no other serious or acute medical illnesses as determined by a
        physical exam and standard laboratory examinations.

        Individuals must be at least 18 years old.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Alcohol or substance use or dependence of sufficient magnitude to require independent,
