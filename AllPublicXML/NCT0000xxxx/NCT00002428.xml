      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a combination of microparticulate monovalent
      HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide candidate vaccine for oral administration and monovalent
      HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide vaccine in alum for intramuscular administration in
      intermediate or higher risk HIV-negative volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Volunteers receive one of two schedules of vaccines or placebo administered at days 0, 28,
      and 168. Specifically, group 1 receives oral microparticulate monovalent vaccine over 3
      consecutive days on days 0, 1, and 2, and 28, 29, and 30, with the intramuscular monovalent
      vaccine given on day 168. Group 2 receives the intramuscular vaccine first, on day 0,
      followed by the oral form given on days 28, 29, and 30 and 168, 169, and 170. Volunteers are
      followed for 1 year.
