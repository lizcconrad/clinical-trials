      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified stem cell transplant
      procedure for treating chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in patients with active infection.
      CGD is an inherited disorder of neutrophils-a type of infection-fighting white blood
      cell-that leaves patients vulnerable to life-threatening infections. Transplantation of
      donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood
      components-white cells, red cells and platelets) can cure CGD. However, this procedure
      carries a significant risk of death, particularly in patients with active infection, because
      it requires completely suppressing the immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and
      radiation. In addition, lymphocytes-another type of infection-fighting white blood cell-from
      the donor may cause what is called graft vs. host disease (GvHD), in which the donor cells
      recognize the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response to destroy them. To try
      to reduce these risks, patients in this study will be given low-dose chemotherapy and no
      radiation, a regimen that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of
      complete immune suppression. Also, the donor's lymphocytes will be removed from the rest of
      the stem cells to be transplanted, reducing the risk of GvHD.

      Patients with CGD between the ages of age 1 and 55 years old who do not have an active
      infection and who have a family member that is a well matched donor may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will have a medical history, physical examination and blood tests, lung and
      heart function tests, X-rays of the chest and sinuses, and dental and eye examinations. A
      bone marrow sample may be taken to evaluate disease status. This test, done under a local
      anesthetic, uses a special needle to draw bone marrow from the hipbone.

      Stem cells will be collected from both the patient and donor. To do this, the hormone G-CSF
      will be injected under the skin for several days to increase stem cell production. Then, the
      stem cells will be collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a
      needle placed in one arm, pumped into a machine where the desired cells are separated out and
      removed, and then the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

      A large plastic tube (central venous line) is placed into a major vein. It can stay in the
      body and be used the entire treatment period to deliver the donated stem cells, give
      chemotherapy or other medications, including antibiotics and blood transfusions, if needed,
      and withdraw blood samples. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will start
      low-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, two commonly used anti-cancer
      drugs. They will also be given anti-thymocyte globulin to prevent rejection of the donated
      cells. When this conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells will be infused through
      the central line. Patients will be given cyclosporine by mouth or by vein from 4 days before
      until 3 months after the stem cell transplant to help prevent rejection.

      The average hospital stay for stem cell transplant is 30 days. After discharge, patients will
      return for follow-up clinic visits weekly or twice weekly for 4 months. These visits will
      include a symptom check, physical examination, and blood tests. Blood transfusions will be
      given if needed. Subsequent visits will be scheduled at 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months
      after the transplant or more often if required, and then yearly.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder of neutrophil function. Patients
      are profoundly immunocompromised, and are plagued early in life with recurrent, and life
      threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure for CGD.

      The goal of this phase I/II study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel
      approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation aimed at decreasing transplant related
      morbidity and mortality. We will treat patients with CGD with an allogeneic, G-CSF mobilized
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA identical family member. The graft will be
      T-cell depleted which will decrease the incidence of acute graft vs. host disease. Donor
      T-cells will be infused post-transplant if engraftment of donor stem cells is unsatisfactory.
      The preparative regimen utilized will provide intense immunosuppression without
      myeloablation. It is designed to allow donor stem cell engraftment while minimizing serious
      transplant related toxicity.

      The end points of this study are engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of
      acute and chronic GVHD, transplant related morbidity and mortality as well as overall
      survival.
