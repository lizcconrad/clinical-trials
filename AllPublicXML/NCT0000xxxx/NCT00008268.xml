      RATIONALE: Melphalan and colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan combined with filgrastim in
      stimulating peripheral stem cells in patients who have multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of melphalan when used with filgrastim (G-CSF) for
           stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma.

        -  Analyze how this mobilization regimen affects parameters of stem cell (CD34+)
           mobilization and collection in these patients.

        -  Determine how this mobilization regimen affects disease status and clonotypic (i.e.,
           tumor cell) contamination in stem cell components in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization consisting of
      melphalan IV on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing
      until PBSC collection is complete.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
