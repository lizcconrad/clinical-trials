  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the protease inhibitors indinavir (IDV) and ritonavir (RTV) will be studied in
      patients who have high levels of virus while taking other protease inhibitors. The purpose of
      this study is to see how the body takes in, distributes, and gets rid of IDV and RTV. This
      study will also look at any side effects that IDV or RTV causes.

      IDV is an effective anti-HIV drug, but it can be difficult for patients to take. For IDV to
      work against HIV, it must be taken 3 times a day at a high dose and with a certain diet.
      Doctors believe IDV may be easier to take if it is given with RTV. Patients who take IDV and
      RTV together may be able to take IDV only twice a day and at a lower dose. This study will
      gather information about the safety and side effects of using IDV and RTV together.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDV, a protease inhibitor, has shown excellent clinical and virologic responses when combined
      with 2 nucleoside analogues. Although effective, the pharmacokinetics of IDV make it
      difficult to use in many patients. The drug has a short half-life and requires administration
      in high doses every 8 hours with significant dietary restrictions. Research has shown that
      IDV kinetics can be improved significantly by the addition of RTV, allowing for
      administration of IDV at lower doses every 12 hours. The half-life of IDV is prolonged 3- to
      5-fold when administered with RTV. Based on these results, it is reasonable to study this
      combination as a twice-daily dosing regimen.

      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of IDV/RTV for 24 weeks (Arms A and B). All
      patients also receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The NRTIs are
      not provided by the study. Clinical assessments take place at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      and 24 which includes a virology assessment. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/21/00: Patients who
      experience a confirmed virologic failure (defined in protocol) and elect to remain on study
      treatment, are followed through Week 24. Patients who experience a confirmed virologic
      failure and elect to discontinue study treatment will have a final evaluation at the time of
      treatment discontinuation.] Patients are hospitalized for 12 hours at the Week 2 study visit
      for an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of at least 500 copies/ml but no more
             than 100,000 copies/ml within 45 days of study entry.

          -  Have been taking the following anti-HIV drug combination for at least 12 weeks before
             study entry: 2 NRTIs plus amprenavir (APV), nelfinavir (NFV), saquinavir (SQV), or NFV
             plus SQV.

          -  Are naive to at least 1 NRTI. This means that there is at least 1 NRTI that the
             patient has not taken for more than 14 days. In the case of lamivudine (3TC), naive
             means that the patient has never taken this drug.

          -  Are willing and able to drink 1.5 liters (a little over 1.5 quarts) of water or other
             fluids a day.

          -  Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control (such as condoms) during the
             study and for 3 months after.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have taken protease inhibitors other than APV, NFV, SQV, or NFV plus SQV.

          -  Are resistant to the effects of IDV or RTV, as shown by a blood test. (Patients whose
             viral load is between 500 and 1,000 copies/ml will not need to be tested.)

          -  Have any active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection in the 14 days before study
             entry.

          -  Have any medical condition or history of disease that would prevent them from
             completing the study or put them at risk.

          -  Have cancer that requires chemotherapy.

          -  Have an active infection that requires treatment in the 14 days before study entry.

          -  Have a fever for a week or more in the 30 days before study entry.

          -  Have taken nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the 30 days
             before study entry.

          -  Have received a vaccine in the 21 days before study entry.

          -  Have received an experimental drug or a drug that affects the immune system in the 30
             days before study entry.

          -  Have taken or plan to take certain other medications that may affect the study.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.
