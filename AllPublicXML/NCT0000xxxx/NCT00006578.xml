      The purpose of this study is to see if the amount of stem cells (cells that can develop into
      many kinds of cells) in the blood before anti-HIV drugs are taken can predict if the immune
      system will become stronger after anti-HIV drugs are given and if anti-HIV drugs can restore
      stem cells.

      HIV infection has been shown to cause stem cells not to function well. Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which causes stem cells to go from the bone marrow
      (tissues in the bones where blood cells are formed) into the bloodstream, could possibly help
      boost immunity after anti-HIV treatment. This study examines the effects of G-CSF in helping
      the immune system become stronger after beginning anti-HIV treatment.

    <textblock>
      In HIV infection, a progressive decline and/or dysfunction of several cell types is seen. It
      is thought that stem cell dysfunction or destruction may contribute to the hematologic and
      immunologic perturbations characteristic of HIV infection and may possibly limit the extent
      of immunologic recovery following HAART. This study proposes to investigate whether stem cell
      function and reserves are important in determining the extent of immune reconstitution
      following HAART.

      Patients are stratified according to CD4 count. On Day 0, patients receive a 7-day cycle of
      subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Blood samples are collected
      regularly, and on Day 14 patients undergo real-time HIV-1 RNA determinations. On Day 28, or
      sooner if HIV RNA is at least 1 log above baseline on Day 14, HAART consisting of daily
      receipt of abacavir, lamivudine, amprenavir, and ritonavir is initiated and continues until
      Week 76. Patients who achieve viral suppression (below 400 copies/ml of plasma HIV-1 RNA) by
      Week 26 are eligible to receive a second 7-day cycle of G-CSF at Week 28 and, if viral
      suppression continues through Week 50, a third cycle of G-CSF at Week 52. Patients are
      followed every 8 weeks for changes in viral load. Additionally, patients are monitored at
      regular intervals for surrogate markers of immunologic recovery and, during each cycle of
      G-CSF, for measurements of stem cell mobilization. Patients may also volunteer for A5085s
      (Bone Marrow Aspirate Substudy) at participating sites.
