      The purpose of this study is to find out if anti-HIV drugs, taken by patients who are newly
      infected with HIV, can make the level of HIV in the body too low to detect.

      Studying patients who recently have been infected with HIV may help researchers understand
      how HIV infection works and how anti-HIV drugs may help these patients. Approved anti-HIV
      drugs can reduce the amount of HIV, but more research needs to be done in newly infected
      patients. This study will look at recently HIV-infected patients to study the progression of
      HIV disease and to see whether anti-HIV drugs can reduce the level of HIV.

      Primary and early HIV infection represents a potentially unique opportunity to better
      understand the pathogenesis of HIV infection, as well as to potentially prevent the
      establishment of latent infection. Approved antiretroviral therapy is able to reduce plasma
      viremia to unmeasurable levels in established infection and several groups have observed
      comparable effects in recently infected adults. This study is designed to evaluate and follow
      a cohort of patients with primary or early HIV infection and to evaluate the time course of
      latent infection and whether latent infection in CD4 cells will allow viral persistence
      despite antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients begin antiretroviral therapy within 7 days of enrollment. All patients are evaluated
      for treatment compliance and complete a compliance questionnaire regularly. Clinical
      evaluations, including CD4, CD8, and HIV RNA counts also are done regularly. Antiretroviral
      therapy is discontinued if there is no detectable virus by ultrasensitive assay and culture
      techniques in plasma, PBMCs, and lymphoid tissue. In a subset of patients, genital secretions
      and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) are evaluated. If relapse occurs, antiretroviral therapy is
      re-instituted. In addition, virology and immunology substudies are performed.
