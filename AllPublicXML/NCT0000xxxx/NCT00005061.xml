      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the preliminary tolerability and safety of monoclonal antibody VEGF
      (MOAB VEGF) in patients with relapsed or refractory progressive solid tumors. II. Determine
      the optimum biologically active dose of MOAB VEGF for further evaluation based on exploratory
      methods. III. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MOAB VEGF in these patients. IV.
      Determine a safe dose of MOAB VEGF for further clinical studies. V. Determine the dose
      limiting toxicity and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. VI. Determine the
      response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody
      VEGF (MOAB VEGF) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, 22, and 29. Patients with partial response
      (PR), complete response (CR), or stable disease (SD) after completion of the fourth dose may
      receive weekly infusions for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB VEGF until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimum biologically active dose (OBAD) are determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.
      The OBAD is defined as the dose at which vascular endothelial growth factor is optimally
      inhibited. Patients with PR, CR, or SD are evaluated every 6 weeks until disease progression
      or initiation of another treatment. Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely due to
      toxicity are followed weekly until resolution of any associated toxicity. Patients who
      discontinue treatment after the fourth dose of MOAB VEGF for any reason other than toxicity
      are followed every month for up to 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
