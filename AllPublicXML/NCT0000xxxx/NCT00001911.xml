      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a drug called interleukin-12 (IL-12) in
      fighting severe infectious (other than tuberculosis) caused by a group of bacteria called
      mycobacteria. IL-12 is similar to a substance the body produces naturally to strengthen
      immune function (infection-fighting ability). It works by stimulating white blood cells to
      increase production of a chemical called interferon gamma, which can improve or cure
      mycobacterial infections in some patients.

      In previous studies, IL-12 has improved immune function against mycobacteria in test tube
      experiments and in mice. A recent study of three patients with mycobacterial infections
      treated with the drug showed encouraging results. The drug has also been studied more
      extensively in patients with cancer, HIV infection and hepatitis C.

      Patients in this study will receive IL-12 injections under the skin twice a week for one
      year. They will be taught how to self-administer the drug, but a home care nurse or a
      physician may also give the injections. The drug dosage will be increased each week to
      determine the safest and most effective dose for fighting this infection. If intolerable side
      effects develop at a certain dose, the previous dose level will be used for the next
      injection. That dose will then be used for the rest of the study, unless unacceptable side
      effects develop at that level, in which case the dose will again be lowered. Patients will
      receive an antibiotic against mycobacteria.

      Physical examinations and blood and urine tests will be done once a month for at least the
      first year and then every 3 months the following year to evaluate kidney, liver, and immune
      function. The first evaluation-at the start of the study-is done on an inpatient basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in patients who are not infected with HIV have
      been shown to be due to abnormalities in the pathways that generate or use interferon gamma
      (IFN gamma). In some of these patients treatment with IFN gamma has been effective in
      improving or curing these infections. Recently, interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been shown to be a
      potent inducer of IFN gamma along with other cytokines. Experiments in animals and
      preliminary experience by us in humans suggests that IL-12 may be an important adjunct to
      antimycobacterial therapy. We seek to use IL-12 in a phase I/II trial in the treatment of
      severe nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in patients who have not been cured by the
      best tolerated conventional therapy with IFN gamma. Patients will be studied for inborn or
      acquired immune defects as well as IL-12 responsiveness in vitro under protocol 93-I-0119
      &quot;Detection and Characterization of Host Defense Defects&quot;. Patients will receive IL-12
      subcutaneously 2 times weekly. We will use an intrapatient dose escalation protocol ranging
      from 20 ng/kg to 300 ng/kg, depending on the highest dose tolerated by the patient. We expect
      this study to yield valuable information about tolerance and toxicity. We seek to treat 10
      patients over the next 3 years.

        Severe disseminated or pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection refractory to the
        best tolerated conventional therapy in addition to IFN gamma delivered for at least 3
        months. This infection must have been proven by culture at some point during the illness.
        At the time of enrollment, patients will be eligible if they have negative cultures but
        histopathologic, examinable, or radiographic evidence of ongoing infection.

        In vitro responsiveness to IL-12 as demonstrated by augmentation of peripheral blood
        mononuclear cell (PBMC) phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced IFN gamma production.

        Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at the time
        of starting the study and agree to take measures to avoid pregnancy throughout the study
        while receiving IL-12. Males will be advised that the effects of IL-12 on sperm are not
        well-known, and they should avoid conception during the study period.
