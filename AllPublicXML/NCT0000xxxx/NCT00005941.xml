      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy
      before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated
      stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer
      cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor
      lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor peripheral stem cell transplant plus
      chemotherapy and total-body irradiation followed by donor white blood cell infusion work in
      treating patients with recurrent metastatic or locally advanced cancer of the cervix or
      vagina that is associated with human papillomavirus.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the partial or complete response in patients with recurrent metastatic or
           locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical or vaginal carcinoma
           treated with a nonmyeloablative regimen comprising fludarabine and low-dose total body
           irradiation followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation,
           cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and donor lymphocyte infusion.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this regimen induces engraftment and donor chimerism in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the HPV-E6 and HPV-E7 specific T-cell responses in selected patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive conditioning therapy comprising fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2 and low-dose
      total body irradiation on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cells are infused on day 0.

      Patients also receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 35 and then tapered until
      day 56. Mycophenolate mofetil is administered orally twice daily on days 0-27.

      Patients with disease progression and no graft-versus-host disease on day 56 receive
      nonmobilized donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 30 minutes on day 65. DLI may be repeated
      every 65 days for up to 4 doses.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, monthly for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
