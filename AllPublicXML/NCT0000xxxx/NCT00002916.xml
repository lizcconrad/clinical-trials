      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from human papillomavirus may make the body build an immune response
      to and kill cervical cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with surgery may be a more
      effective treatment for cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with
      surgery works in treating patients with early cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the systemic immunological response to the human papilloma virus vaccine
           (TA-HPV) expressing the proteins 16, 18, E6 and E7 examining the cytolytic T cell and
           the antibody responses in cervical cancer patients.

        -  Investigate further the safety and toxic effects of TA-HPV in these patients.

        -  Assess the proliferative capacity of T cells to the E6 and E7 proteins.

        -  Observe any influence of vaccination with TA-HPV on the disease free interval or
           patterns of recurrence in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive 2 vaccinations of the human papilloma virus with proteins 16, 18, E6 and E7
      at least 4 weeks apart, with the first vaccination at least 2 weeks before surgery and the
      second 8 weeks after the first one, unless unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who require
      radiotherapy following surgery receive their second vaccination 4-8 weeks after the first
      vaccination.

      Twenty-eight patients are entered initially; if at least 2 patients show an immunologic
      response, 16 additional patients are entered.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then
      annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 44 patients will be entered over 1 year.
