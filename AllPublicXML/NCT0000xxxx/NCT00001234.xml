  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from glycocerebroside
      GLUCOCEREBROSIDE (1) accumulation in macrophages due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase. It may occur in patients of all ages. The most severe form, Type 2
      Gaucher's Disease occurs in infants who die in the first years of life (with rapidly
      progressive neurologic deterioration). The condition is passed from generation to generation
      through autosomal recessive inheritance.

      Fabry's disease isa genetic disorder (X-linked recessive) due to the absence of the enzyme
      a-galactosidase A. The disease is characterized by abnormal collections of glycolipids in
      cells (histiocytes) within blood vessel walls, tumors on the thighs, buttocks, and
      genitalia(2) decreased sweating, tingling sensations in the extremities, and cataracts.
      Patients with Fabry's disease die from complications of the kidney, heart, or brain.

      Both conditions are caused by the absence of specific enzymes (3). Patients with these
      conditions are missing (3) or have defective genes needed for the normal production of these
      enzymes. Studies on the blood-forming cells in bone marrow have lead to gene therapies using
      retroviruses as vehicles to carry and insert working genes into abnormal or diseased cells.

      This study is designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of transferring working copies
      of genes responsible for making missing enzymes into the cells of patients with Gaucher's or
      Fabry disease.

      This protocol was developed in order to obtain bone marrow stem cells for ex vivo
      transduction with retroviruses containing the human glucocerebrosidase gene. We continue to
      enter a small number of patients to this protocol each year. Studies with the bone marrow
      hematopoietic progenitor cells have enabled us to identify the most effective retroviral
      construct currently available in order to carry out gene therapy trials in patients with
      Gaucher's disease. The data revealed that a comparatively simple retroviral construct
      containing human glucocerebrosidase cDNA driven by the MoLV promoter is highly effective. We
      have obtained approval and initiated a Phase I safety and gene marking investigation in
      patients with Type I Gaucher's Disease.
