  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent intravenous (IV) foscarnet in the
      treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in AIDS patients and
      other immunocompromised patients. To evaluate the necessity, efficacy, and safety of IV
      maintenance foscarnet therapy in preventing recurrent disease. To confirm the
      pharmacokinetics of intermittent induction and maintenance IV regimens.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Cyclosporine.

        Patients must have AIDS as defined by the CDC or be immunocompromised (transplant patients;
        other hematologic malignancies with recognized cell-mediated immune deficiency). Patients
        must also have herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection documented by culture and in vitro
        resistance to acyclovir by standard laboratory susceptibility or suspected resistance to
        acyclovir after an acyclovir treatment failure in which acyclovir was administered for at
        least 2 weeks intravenously at doses of 30 mg/kg/day (or a comparative dose adjusted for
        renal insufficiency). In vitro susceptibility data must be pending in the latter case.
        Patients must be able to give informed consent. Patients &lt; 18 years of age may participate
        with the consent of parent, guardian, or person with power of attorney, or through the
        provisions of state laws regarding emancipated minors. Patients must have expected survival
        of at least 6 months.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Cyclosporin.

          -  Ganciclovir.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Known allergy to foscarnet.

          -  Any clinically significant pulmonary or neurologic impairment (e.g., patients who are
             intubated or comatose).

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any potentially nephrotoxic agent (except cyclosporine).

          -  Immunomodulators.

          -  Biologic response modifiers.

          -  Investigational agents.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Known allergy to foscarnet.

          -  Any clinically significant pulmonary or neurologic impairment (e.g., patients who are
             intubated or comatose).

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 7 days of study entry:

          -  Any potentially nephrotoxic agent (except cyclosporin).

          -  Immunomodulators.

          -  Biologic response modifiers.

          -  Investigational agents.
