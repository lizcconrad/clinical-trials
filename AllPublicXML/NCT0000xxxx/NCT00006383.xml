      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal vincristine in treating
      patients who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete and partial tumor responses in patients with aggressive
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is refractory to or relapsed after second-line combination
           chemotherapy treated with vincristine sulfate liposomes injection.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposomes IV over 1 hour. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
