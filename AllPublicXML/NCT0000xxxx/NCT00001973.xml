    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how a gene mutation (change in DNA) causes the abnormal bone in
      fibrous dysplasia-a condition in which areas of normal bone are replaced with a fibrous
      growth similar to a scar. The bone abnormalities in fibrous dysplasia can occur in a single
      bone (monostotic fibrous dysplasia), multiple bones (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia), or in
      McCune Albright syndrome, in which there are associated glandular abnormalities. This study
      will also examine calcinosis samples that have been surgically removed from patients with
      juvenile dermatomyositis.

      Patients who are scheduled to have orthopedic surgery for treatment of polyostotic fibrous
      dysplasia may participate in this study. A small sample of bone tissue removed during surgery
      will be given to investigators in this study for research tests. DNA will be extracted from
      the tissue and tested for the mutation. Investigators will attempt to grow cells from the
      sample in the laboratory to evaluate them for their ability to grow and make proteins that
      normal bone cells make. These tests are designed to help scientists understand how the
      mutation leads to abnormal bone formation and provide information that might lead to better
      treatments for fibrous dysplasia. Patients with juvenile Dermatomyositis who have a
      calcinosis sample surgically removed are also eligible for participation. The removed tissues
      will be examined for their composition and microscopic appearance, to better understand the
      pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification in this disease.

      Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a sporadic disorder in which multiple sites of bone
      are replaced by abnormal fibrous tissue. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune
      Albright syndrome (MAS). We have previously identified a somatic activating mutation in the
      gene encoding the alpha-subunit of Gs, the G protein which mediates the action of hormones
      that work by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), in
      affected tissues from patients with PFD and MAS. The objectives of this study are to
      determine how activating mutations of the Gs alpha-subunit lead to the changes of PFD, and to
      determine if interventions that block the biochemical effects of the activating mutation in
      in vitro and in vivo animal model systems could prevent some of the cellular changes
      characteristic of PFD. To carry out these studies, we plan to obtain pathologic bone tissue
      from patients with either isolated PFD or PFD in the context of MAS. In one phase of the
      study, archival pathology specimens of affected bone will be retrospectively analyzed using a
      variety of immunohistochemical techniques. In the second phase of the study, specimens of
      affected bone will be obtained prospectively from patients undergoing clinically indicated
      orthopedic procedures. Specimens will be placed in primary culture, cultured cells will be
      analyzed for the Gs alpha-subunit activating mutation, and the mutant-bearing cells will be
      studied by a variety of cell biologic and pharmacologic techniques.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients who are scheduled to have orthopedic surgery for treatment of polyostotic
        fibrous dysplasia (PFD).

        Tissue will only be obtained from those patients in whom the procedure is clinically
        indicated for standard reasons such as treatment of or prevention of fractures, or
        disfigurement resulting from abnormal growth of facial and/ or skull bones.

        The diagnosis of PFD will have been established by standard radiologic criteria and in
        patients with McCune Albright syndrome (MAS), also by the characteristic skin and endocrine
        manifestations associated with that form of the disease.

        Patients meeting criteria for juvenile dermatomyositis who undergo surgical removal of
        calcinosis are eligible. The tissue from surgery would be used in the research study.
