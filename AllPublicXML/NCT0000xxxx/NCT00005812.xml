      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate, survival time, and quality of life of patients
           with leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma when treated with oral
           temozolomide.

        -  Determine adverse events related to this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Measure temozolomide concentrations in CSF and serum and correlate with appropriate
           pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., response) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 10 weeks
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR.
      Patients with a CR except for residual radiographic abnormalities that persist unchanged for
      2 full courses continue for 4 courses past best response.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly for the first 4 weeks of therapy, and then
      monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
