      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether
      monoclonal antibody therapy is more effective than observation for ovarian cancer or primary
      peritoneal cancer that is in remission.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody
      therapy with that of observation in treating patients who have ovarian cancer or primary
      peritoneal cancer in remission following surgery and chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody HMFG1, in terms of survival,
           in patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma in remission after debulking surgery and
           platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate this treatment regimen, in terms of the time to relapse, ECOG performance
           status, frequency of hospitalization, changes in concurrent medication, and incidence
           and severity of adverse events, in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard therapy (observation).

        -  Arm II: After imaging studies of the peritoneal cavity to verify adequate fluid
           distribution, patients receive yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody HMFG1 intraperitoneally
           over 1 minute.

      Quality of life is assessed in all patients prior to randomization, at weeks 4 and 8, at 3
      months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      Patients in arm I are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Patients in arm II are followed weekly
      for 6 weeks and at weeks 8 and 12. All patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients (210 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
