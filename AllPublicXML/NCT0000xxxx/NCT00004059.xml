      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. UCN-01 may increase the effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug by
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus UCN-01 in treating
      patients who have advanced or refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and toxicity profile of
           fluorouracil with UCN-01 in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.

        -  Assess the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen and correlate with observed
           toxicities in these patients.

        -  Obtain preliminary data on the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fluorouracil.

      Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients receive an
      initial dose of UCN-01 IV over 72 hours beginning on day 2 during course 1 and then
      maintenance UCN-01 IV over 36 hours beginning on day 2 during subsequent courses. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-48 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 14 months.
