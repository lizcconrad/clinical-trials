  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of this ongoing research program is to find more effective treatments for
      alcohol dependence by combining medication with the appropriate psychosocial support. This
      proposal has three specific aims: (1) to compare the effectiveness of naltrexone (Revia) in
      three types of treatment settings; (2) to assess the effects of psychosocial support on
      medication compliance and treatment retention; and (3) to investigate the individual
      characteristics that may predict who is likely to benefit from additional psychosocial
      support versus simple medication management.
