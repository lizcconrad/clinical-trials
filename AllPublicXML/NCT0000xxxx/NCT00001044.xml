  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To examine the safety and potential improvement in immune responses elicited by
      combining rsgp120/HIV-1MN with the adjuvant QS-21. SECONDARY: To examine the role of alum in
      the vaccine/adjuvant formulation; to determine the optimal dose ratio of vaccine to adjuvant;
      and to obtain initial information on the optimal schedule of administration. AS PER AMENDMENT
      07/02/97: To determine the ability of immunization with rsgp120/HV-1MN in combination with
      QS21 with or without alum to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity
      (DTH) response in volunteers who undergo rsgp120/MN skin testing.

      Immune responses in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving subunit envelope vaccines formulated
      with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro
      may be induced, but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in
      individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition
      or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.

      Immune responses in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving subunit envelope vaccines formulated
      with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro
      may be induced, but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in
      individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition
      or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.

      Volunteers are randomized to 20 treatment arms containing four patients each. rsgp120/HIV-1MN
      is administered at four dose levels: 0, 100, 300, and 600 mcg, and QS-21 adjuvant is
      administered at three dose levels: 0, 50, and 100 mcg. Some subject cohorts receive alum in
      the vaccine formulation. Sixty volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 10, and 20
      volunteers receive injections at months 0, 1, and 6. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: All
      consenting volunteers who have received three immunizations will be tested for DTH response
      to HIV-1 envelope with use of intradermal MN rsgp120. Follow-up is extended to 56 days after
      administration of the intradermal injections.

          -  Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrite.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Subjects with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude
             compliance.

        Subjects with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, or use of immunosuppressive
             medications.
