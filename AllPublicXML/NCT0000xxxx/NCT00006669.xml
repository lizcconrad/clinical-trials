      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to kill cancer cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy
      with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab followed by combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with refractory or recurrent CD20+
      intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab followed by
      etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (EPOCH). II. Determine
      the toxicity of the regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-10 hours on day 1
      followed by etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 4-7,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 5-30 minutes on day 8 and oral prednisone on days 4-8. Patients also
      receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 9 until blood counts recover.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of intermediate grade B-cell CD20+ non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma Failed to achieve initial complete response (CR) after at least 2 courses of
        standard chemotherapy OR Relapsed after CR and not eligible for autologous bone marrow
        transplant Measurable disease defined as one of the following: Bidimensionally measurable
        disease at least 2 cm in diameter by radiograph or CT scan Enlarged spleen extending at
        least 2 cm below the costal due to lymphomatous involvement Enlarged liver with focal
        lesions on CT scan or biopsy proven lesions Lymphomatous hepatic involvement must be biopsy
        proven for the liver to be sole area of measurable disease No evidence of CNS involvement A
        new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-3 Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3* Platelet count at
        least 100,000/mm3* *unless there is bone marrow involvement with lymphoma Hepatic:
        Bilirubin less than 3 mg/dL AST/ALT less than 2 times normal Renal: Creatinine less than
        2.1 mg/dL OR Creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: LVEF greater than
        45% by MUGA or echocardiogram Other: No prior malignancy within the past 10 years except
        squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical cancer No evidence
        of infection HIV negative Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients
        must use effective contraception

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics No prior rituximab
