  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide bone marrow and/or blood cells for other research studies.
      Patients participating in this study will be asked to provide small amounts of medical
      information and undergo a limited physical examination designed to detect the presence of any
      obvious blood disease. A blood and bone marrow sample will be obtained to verify that the
      patient has normal blood cell production.

      Researchers plan to obtain bone marrow samples to be used in laboratory studies directed
      toward understanding the formation of blood cells. Bone marrow samples will be taken from the
      hip bone of patients and healthy volunteers.

      These samples are valuable to many research studies within the Hematology Branch of the
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, including studies of normal and abnormal
      production of blood cells, the viral causes of blood diseases, and the role of the immune
      system in bone marrow failure and related conditions....

      This protocol defines in general terms the purposes for which blood and bone marrow specimens
      will be collected by members of the Hematology Branch and the conditions under which the
      sampling will be performed. Samples of blood and bone marrow from healthy volunteers and from
      patients are indispensable for many research projects, including studies of normal and
      abnormal hematopoiesis, the viral etiology of blood diseases, and the role of the immune
      system in marrow failure and related conditions.
