      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who
      have advanced head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck when treated with oxaliplatin. II. Characterize the toxicities and
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of
      response, time to progression, and survival of these patients receiving this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (yes vs no). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2
      weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression. Patients are followed until toxicity resolves or for no less than 30
      days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 17 months.
