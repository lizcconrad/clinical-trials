  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous sargramostim ( granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF ) in increasing and maintaining the granulocyte count in
      HIV-infected children who have developed granulocytopenia as a result of continuous
      intravenous ( CIV ) zidovudine ( AZT ). To assess the short-term and long-term effects of
      concomitant GM-CSF on other hematologic parameters. To assess the potential therapeutic
      benefit of concomitant GM-CSF and AZT on the natural history of HIV infection and associated
      infectious complications.
