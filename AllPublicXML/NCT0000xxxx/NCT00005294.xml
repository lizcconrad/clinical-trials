      BACKGROUND:

      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy has been shown to be related to less optimal physical
      and psychological functioning later in life. Although infants with the disorder increased
      from 1978 to 1988, little was known about potential developmental problems early in life
      which might lead to the documented negative sequelae shown in previous research.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this longitudinal study, infants were followed from birth and given standardized
      assessments of developmental and physical functioning. Demographic, birth, and medical data
      were collected at baseline through chart review. Standardized questionnaires measuring
      parental stress and family support were administered to the parents. Infants were followed at
      eight months, and one, two, and three years at which time parental measures were repeated and
      standardized assessments made of the children's physical growth, medical status, cognitive,
      language and behavioral development. Feeding behaviors were assessed through standardized
      observation and interview at each visit. Data were evaluated descriptively as well as through
      a series of multivariate analyses of variance with repeated measures.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
