    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have stage
      IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that overexpresses HER2. Monoclonal antibodies
      can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the activity of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with stage IIIB or IV
      HER2-overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine
      the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      III. Assess levels of circulating HER2 and correlate with HER2 expression in this patient
      population.

      V. Correlate circulating HER2 levels with non-small cell lung cancer tissue HER2 expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues
      once a week in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 84 patients (42 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 17.5 months.
