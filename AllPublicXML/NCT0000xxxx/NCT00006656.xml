      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating patients who
      have progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) in
           patients with unresectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I of this study
           closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Estimate peripheral blood carmustine levels in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) intratumorally over 5 minutes during
      stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTI-015 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of
      01/15/2002.)

      Additional patients then receive treatment with DTI-015 at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then every 1-3 months until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients were accrued for phase I of this study and
      approximately 14-18 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study. (Phase I of this
      study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)
