  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain and nerve cells communicate with each other by releasing and picking up chemicals
      called neurotransmitters. Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter used by part of the nervous
      system activated during stress called the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous
      system is involved with regulating blood pressure and pulse rate. Researchers believe the
      level norepinephrine in the blood can be used to measure activity of the sympathetic nervous
      system.

      This study is designed to answer important questions about rates of release of norepinephrine
      into the blood stream, removal of released norepinephrine, and the sympathetic nervous system
      response to stress.

      Researchers will attempt to measure levels of norepinephrine and activity of the sympathetic
      nervous system in patients with high blood pressure, normal patients with family histories of
      high blood pressure, patients taking drugs that can effect levels of norepinephrine, and
      patients with diseases or conditions directly affecting the sympathetic nervous system.

      In order to examine sympathetic nervous system function in neurocardiological disorders and
      catecholaminergic effects of dietary manipulations or neuropsychiatric drugs, the protocol
      calls for evaluations of the kinetics of 3H-norepinephrine or 3H-epinephrine in patients with
      hypertension, dysautonomias, or disorders thought to involve abnormal catecholaminergic
      function, and in normotensive normal volunteers. Apparent spillover and clearance rates are
      estimated based on the norepinephrine or epinephrine concentration during the infusion and
      their steady-state specific activities, under resting conditions and in response to
      physiological or pharmacological manipulations thought to affect sympathetic outflows.
