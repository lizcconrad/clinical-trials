  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give SU5416 to
      HIV-infected patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). SU5416 may prevent the growth
      of KS tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Groups of 3-6 patients are sequentially assigned to receive escalating doses of SU5416 in 33%
      increments. Study drug is administered as a twice-weekly intravenous injection for 4 weeks.
      In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, responding patients may continue on SU5416 in 4-week
      treatment cycles for a maximum of 1 year or until the presence of unacceptable toxicity or
      tumor progression.
