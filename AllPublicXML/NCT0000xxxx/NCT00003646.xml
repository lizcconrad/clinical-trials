      RATIONALE: Injecting allovectin-7 into a person's melanoma cells may make the body build an
      immune response that will kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who
      have stage III or stage IV melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Demonstrate an objective clinical response (partial or complete) with a median
      duration of at least 4 months in 15% of patients with stage III or IV melanoma treated with
      Allovectin-7. Allovectin-7 is a direct gene transfer immunotherapeutic agent.

      II. Determine the benefits, risks, and side effects of Allovectin-7 in this patient
      population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive an intratumoral injection of
      Allovectin-7 once weekly for 6 weeks. At week 9, a complete disease status assessment is
      performed. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of 6
      injections.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
