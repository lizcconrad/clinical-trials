      To further evaluate the safety of megestrol acetate (Megace) oral suspension in the treatment
      of anorexia and cachexia in HIV-positive women. To compare the effectiveness of 2 doses of
      Megace by measurement of weight gain, appetite grade, and other parameters at 12 and 24
      weeks.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of Megace oral suspension daily for 24 weeks;
      at 12 weeks, those receiving the lower dose who have not gained 5 pounds over baseline or had
      appetite improvement to good or excellent are escalated to the higher dose. Patients are
      evaluated at 4-week intervals. Dose may be adjusted to maintain a desired weight.
