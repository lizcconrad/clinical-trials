  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of protease inhibitors is increasing in HIV-infected children because this treatment
      has resulted in improved body weight, improved immune status and less hospitalizations.
      However, recent reports suggest that these drugs may also be associated with some negative
      side-effects, specifically a syndrome of diabetes and fat redistribution. Development of the
      fat redistribution/diabetes syndrome has recently been reported in HIV-infected children, as
      well as in adults. Diabetes is associated with complications such as increased heart disease,
      eye disease and loss of kidney function. Thus development of diabetes is a significant
      problem which could outweigh the benefits obtained by treating patients with protease
      inhibitors. One major cause of diabetes is lack of normal response to insulin (insulin
      resistance). Insulin resistance tends to be worse in family members where one or more parent
      has diabetes, and is also worse in certain ethnic groups. The first major purpose of our
      study is measure insulin resistance in HIV-infected children who do not take protease
      inhibitors, and compare our findings to those from patients who are treated with protease
      inhibitors. We will also follow patients newly treated with protease inhibitors for two years
      to evaluate changes in insulin sensitivity. These results will be correlated with each
      patient's family history of diabetes and with ethnicity, and should help us better predict
      which children are &quot;at risk&quot; for development of diabetes from protease inhibitor therapy.
      Children with HIV infection often have problems with gaining enough weight and with poor
      linear growth (height). One likely reason for this is the way their bodies use and store
      protein. The second purpose of our study is measure protein turnover and to correlate our
      findings with growth data. We also plan to study the effects of protease inhibitor therapy on
      protein turnover. We believe that these studies will provide knowledge to help clinicians
      formulate recommendations for nutritional and medical therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for HIV infected children- a) The participants may be either
             antiretroviral treatment naive, or experienced. Those individuals who are experienced
             will be treated with at least one new drug in addition to the protease inhibitor. The
             selection of the new antiretroviral regimen will be directed by a review of the
             patient's previous drug treatment history and/or the genetic or phenotypic
             characteristics of the patient's virus; b) We will recruit subjects from all CDC
             categories. Disease severity will subsequently be analyzed as a covariate; c) There
             will be no height, weight or other anthropometric inclusion criterion (these factors
             will be analyzed as covariates); d) All subjects will be studied when they have not
             had an acute superinfection for at least four weeks.

          -  Inclusion criteria for controls- Control volunteers will be normal healthy children
             who are matched to the HIV infected population for age, weight and race. Normal health
             and non-HIV infected status will be determined by history and by medical record
             review. Ethical considerations preclude HIV testing in normal children. Separate
             informed consent and assent forms will be utilized for the control and HIV population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for HIV infected children- Use of Megace@ or another progestational
             agent, use of anabolic steroids, acute superinfection

          -  Exclusion criteria for controls- Previous medical history of any chronic disease or
             glucocorticoid use in the last six weeks. Adopted children who have no knowledge of
             family history.
