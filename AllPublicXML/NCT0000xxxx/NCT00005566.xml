      The purpose of this project is to pilot a new scale, The Desperation Scale, in a sample of
      young adolescents (aged 10-16) seen in the pediatric emergency room who require a psychiatric
      consultation. The proposed study is designed to assess the psychometric properties of this
      new scale and to provide information about the cognitive state of young suicidal individuals.
      It is hypothesized that this scale will be able to discriminate between those who are
      suicidal and those who are not. Data obtained in this pilot study will provide information
      about the usefulness of the construct of desperation and will guide future projects aimed at
      the assessment and treatment of suicidal individuals. The use of cognitive factors to predict
      suicidal behavior is appealing because they allow the clinician to tap into an individual's
      perception of his/her life circumstances. However, we believe the popular conceptualization
      of suicide as a result of &quot;hopeless&quot; thinking ignores an important aspect of suicidal
      behavior-the motivation to escape. We propose that a model of suicidal behavior that includes
      escape motivation, which we call the desperation model, will be better able to predict
      suicide than existing measures. We conceptualize desperation as consisting of three core
      elements: a sense of entrapment, feelings of anxiety/agitation, and a sense of time urgency.
      The current pilot study will test a 35-item scale that assesses these three elements of
      desperation. A pilot study of the Desperation Scale is currently being conducted at the
      Cornell University Medical Center (P.I. P.M. Marzuk) with depressed, adult inpatients. Our
      study is original in its use of the scale with an adolescent population and its focus on
      patients in the emergency room, when they are presumably in a &quot;purer&quot; suicidal state. It is
      hypothesized that those who are admitted to the emergency room for recent suicidal behavior
      will endorse feelings of entrapment, anxiety, and time urgency.
