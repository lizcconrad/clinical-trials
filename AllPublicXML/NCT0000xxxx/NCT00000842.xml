  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of recombinant human nerve growth factor (
      rhNGF ) in the treatment of HIV-associated sensory neuropathy. AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97: To
      compare the change in viral load between the double-blind phase baseline and week 4 in
      placebo and active rhNGF recipients. To ensure that rhNGF does not induce an increase in
      viral load compared with viral load changes seen with placebo.

      Up to now, treatments for HIV-associated sensory neuropathy have been symptomatic, relying on
      pain-modifying agents or membrane-stabilizing drugs. Because nerve growth factor is important
      in the development and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons and their outgrowths,
      it is proposed that recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide a specific restorative
      treatment for HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy.

      Up to now, treatments for HIV-associated sensory neuropathy have been symptomatic, relying on
      pain-modifying agents or membrane-stabilizing drugs. Because nerve growth factor is important
      in the development and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons and their outgrowths,
      it is proposed that recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide a specific restorative
      treatment for HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either rhNGF at one of two doses or placebo, administered
      subcutaneously twice weekly for 18 weeks. Patients are stratified into three groups within
      their regimens by use of didanosine, zalcitabine, or stavudine as follows: current use vs.
      discontinued between 8 and 26 weeks before randomization vs. never used or discontinued use
      at least 26 weeks before randomization. Patients will assess their pain daily using the
      Gracely Pain Scale. AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97: After completion of the double-blind phase (18
      weeks on treatment followed by 4 weeks off treatment), patients may receive open-label,
      active drug treatment according to their previously assigned regimen for an additional 48
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis, MAI bacteremia, or cryptococcal meningitis is
             permitted.

          -  Local therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma.

        Patients must have:

          -  Evidence of HIV antibodies documented by a licensed ELISA and a second, FDA-approved,
             confirmatory test.

          -  Diagnosis of HIV-associated, predominantly sensory neuropathy by a neurologist.

          -  Willingness and ability to complete the pain and medication log and competence to
             assess pain level throughout the study.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  History of stable-dose (defined as no more than 50% increase or decrease in dose)
             antiretroviral therapy for eight weeks before randomization, including the following:

          -  didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, protease inhibitors, and
             antiretrovirals available through expanded access trials.

          -  Chemotherapeutic drugs other than neurotoxic systemic chemotherapeutic agents within
             30 days prior to randomization.

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Presence of acute, active, opportunistic infection, except oral thrush; oral, genital

             supplementation or supplementation &lt;= 3 months, or treatment with any drug that might
             contribute to sensory neuropathy.

          -  Major active psychiatric disorder (depression is allowed provided patient has received
             a stable antidepressant regimen for at least four weeks before randomization).

          -  Current active malignancy. NOTE: Malignancies in remission that do not require further
             treatment or Kaposi's sarcoma requiring only local treatment are allowed.

          -  Any conditions, including dementia and myelopathy, that would interfere with patient
             evaluation, accurate completion of the symptom scale, or compliance with subcutaneous
             injection.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Chemotherapeutic agents.

          -  Systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Neurotoxic systemic chemotherapy within the past 90 days.

          -  Systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators within the past 30 days.

             randomization (including tricyclic antidepressants, mexiletine, phenytoin, and
             carbamazepine).

          -  Treatment for acute opportunistic infections within the past 14 days (maintenance
             therapy for CMV retinitis, MAI bacteremia, or cryptococcal meningitis is permitted).

        Active drug or alcohol abuse that would affect study compliance.
