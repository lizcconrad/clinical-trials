  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an inherited disease which results in decreased
      pigmentation (oculocutaneous albinism), bleeding problems due to a platelet abnormality
      (platelet storage pool defect), and storage of an abnormal fat-protein compound (lysosomal
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin).

      The disease can cause poor functioning of the lungs, intestine, kidneys, or heart. The major
      complication of the disease is pulmonary fibrosis and typically causes death in patients ages
      40 - 50 years old. The disorder is common in Puerto Rico, where many of the clinical research
      studies on the disease have been conducted. Neither the full extent of the disease nor the
      basic cause of the disease is known. There is no known treatment for HPS.

      The purpose of this study is to perform research into the medical complications of HPS and
      begin to understand what causes these complications. Researchers will clinically evaluate
      patients with HPS of all ethnic backgrounds. They will obtain cells, blood components
      (plasma), and urine for future studies. Genetic tests (mutation analysis) to detect
      HPS-causing genes will also be conducted.&lt;TAB&gt;

    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of
      oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet storage pool defect and, in some patients, lysosomal
      accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. Other manifestations include pulmonary fibrosis (often
      fatal in the fourth or fifth decade), chronic granulomatous colitis and, rarely, renal
      involvement or cardiomyopathy. There exist 8 different genes known to cause HPS, but only
      HPS-2 has a basic defect that is known. HPS-2 disease results from mutations in the b3A
      subunit of a coat protein, adaptor complex-3, responsible for intracellular vesicle
      formation. One severe subtype of the disorder, HPS-1, is common in northwest Puerto Rico, and
      another milder subtype, HPS-3, is seen in central Puerto Rico. HPS-4 disease displays no
      founder population, and its severity resembles that of HPS-1. HPS-5 and HPS-6 resemble HPS-3
      in severity. HPS-7 and HPS-8 are recently described and have not been fully characterized. In
      this protocol, we will clinically evaluate HPS patients of all ethnicities, obtain cells,
      plasma, and urine for future studies, perform mutation analysis for known HPS-causing genes,
      and search for other genes responsible for HPS. Routine admissions will last 4-5 days and
      occur approximately every two years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        HPS patients of any gender and ethnicity age 1-80 years are eligible to enroll in this
        protocol.

        Patients will be diagnosed as having HPS based upon a paucity or deficiency of platelet
        dense bodies on whole mount electron microscopy.

        Some patients who have not yet had this laboratory test will be admitted to the protocol
        based upon the presence of albinism combined with a platelet storage pool deficiency.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patient will be excluded if they cannot travel to the NIH because of their medical
        condition.

        Infants under age one.
