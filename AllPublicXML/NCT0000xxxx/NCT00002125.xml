  <brief_summary>

      To assess the relative efficacy of oral versus intravenous hydration during foscarnet sodium
      (Foscavir) induction therapy, as determined by changes in creatinine clearance. To estimate
      the timing and volume of oral fluid hydration required to establish a diuresis before and
      during intravenous Foscavir therapy. To assess the general tolerance of two hydration
      regimens by the adverse event profile associated with each.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive oral hydration versus intravenous hydration therapy during
      concomitant intermittent intravenous Foscavir therapy for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      retinitis. Treatment continues during 2 or 3 weeks of induction Foscavir therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Recent diagnosis of CMV retinitis, by ophthalmoscopic appearance, that requires
             induction therapy.

          -  No corneal, lens, or vitreous opacification that precludes examination of the fundi.

          -  No evidence of other end organ CMV infection.

          -  No evidence of tuberculous, diabetic, or hypertensive retinopathy.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal or renal
             impairment that would prevent adequate voluntary oral hydration (e.g., intubation,
             coma, status post-gastrectomy, colon resection, gastrointestinal tumors,
             malabsorption, chronic diarrhea) OR with which hydration would be hazardous (e.g.,
             congestive heart failure).

          -  Known allergy to foscarnet or related compounds.

          -  Considered noncompliant or unreliable for study participation.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any investigational drug.

          -  Potentially nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, cisplatin).

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any investigational drug within 28 days prior to study entry.

          -  Potentially nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, cisplatin)
             within 7 days prior to study entry.
