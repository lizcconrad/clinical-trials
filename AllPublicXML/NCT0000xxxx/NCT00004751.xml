      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy and safety of selective dorsal rhizotomy and physiotherapy compared
      with physiotherapy alone in improving gross motor function and reducing spasticity in
      children with spastic diplegia.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by age and the ability
      to ambulate 50 feet unaided. Each stratum is block randomized.

      Patients are randomly assigned to surgery plus intensive physical therapy versus intensive
      physical therapy alone.

      The surgical procedure is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. Physical therapy (PT) includes
      passive and active range of motion, facilitation of isolated muscle control, transitional
      movements, strengthening, transfer skills, and gait training. The PT schedule is 2-hour
      sessions 5 days a week for 1 month, 1-hour sessions 5 days a week for 5 months, then a
      standard therapy program for the remainder of the study (total of 6 months). Parents
      supervise exercise on non-PT days.

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, and 24 months.
