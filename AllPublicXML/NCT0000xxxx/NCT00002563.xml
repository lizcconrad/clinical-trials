      RATIONALE: Quality-of-life assessment in patients undergoing cancer treatment may help
      determine the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies the impact of therapy on the health status and quality
      of life of patients with stage I or stage II Hodgkin's disease who are receiving radiation
      therapy with or without chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate prospectively the health status and quality of life of patients with
      Stage I/IIA Hodgkin's disease randomized on protocol SWOG-9133 (CLB-9391) to treatment with
      subtotal nodal irradiation with vs. without 3 courses of doxorubicin/vinblastine. II.
      Describe the short-term effects of these treatments on these patients and compare their
      impact on quality of life (i.e., patient symptom status, health status, fatigue). III.
      Evaluate the intermediate and long-term effects of these treatments on these patients and
      compare their impact on quality-of-life outcomes over 5 years.

      OUTLINE: Quality-of-Life Assessment. Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System Short Form,
      CARES-SF; Symptom and Personal Information Questionnaire (including Symptom Distress Scale,
      MOS SF-36 Fatigue Scale, MOS SF-36 Health Perception Rating, Demographics); Cover Sheet.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued over 7 years.
