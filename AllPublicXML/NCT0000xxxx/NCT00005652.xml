      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and response duration to rituximab in patients
      with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity associated with this treatment regimen in these patients.

      III. Evaluate the alteration in antiplatelet antibody with this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients who
      achieve a clinical response lasting over 4 months may receive a second course of rituximab.

      Patients are followed at 5, 6, 8, and 12 weeks, and then at 6 and 9 months.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Clinically confirmed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Platelet count less than
        75,000/mm3 on two occasions at least 1 week apart within past month

        Normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes on bone marrow examination within past 6
        months

        Failed prior steroid therapy (i.e., unable to achieve sustained platelet count greater than
        75,000/mm3)

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        Endocrine therapy: Concurrent steroids allowed as long as platelet count is less than
        75,000/mm3 and dose is not changed within past 2 weeks or during study

        Other:

          -  No other concurrent medical therapy for immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)
