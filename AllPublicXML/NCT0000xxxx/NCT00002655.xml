      RATIONALE: Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery in treating patients with
      unresectable primary liver cancer or liver metastases.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of liquid nitrogen necrosis of liver lesions
      using a commercially available intraoperative cryosurgical system, with placement of the
      cryoprobe and subsequent monitoring by high-resolution ultrasound. II. Use this technique on
      selected patients with surgically unresectable metastatic or primary liver cancer whose
      disease appears confined to the liver and who are potentially curable if all tumor in the
      liver can be destroyed. III. Quantitate the quality and duration of survival, identify
      recurrence of hepatic malignant disease, and identify any morbidity from the procedure.

      OUTLINE: Cryosurgery. Liquid nitrogen freezing of tumor using a cryoprobe placed and
      maintained under ultrasound guidance.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be treated.

      <textblock>
        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Biopsy-proven metastatic or primary malignant disease of the liver
        No extrahepatic regional or distant metastases No primary tumors commonly associated with
        local spread or metastases to other sites, e.g.: Gastric cancer Pancreatic cancer Breast
        cancer Lung cancer Liver lesions considered unresectable because of location in relation to
        major vascular structures or involvement of multiple hepatic segments Tumor extent and
        location such that cryosurgery expected to destroy all tumor and render patient
        disease-free Tumor volume no greater than 50% of total hepatic volume on CT No more than 12
        lesions

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 21 Other: Overall health permitting safe laparotomy
        Blood/body fluid analyses and imaging/exams for tumor measurement within 1 month prior to
        registration

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Prior liver resection, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy allowed
