      BACKGROUND:

      The Vietnam Veteran Twin Registry, maintained by the NAS-NRC, was created with funding from
      the Veterans Administration. Department of Defense records were searched for subjects born
      between 1939-1957 and having the same last name and date of birth. Follow-up of induction
      records determined if the subjects were twins.

      The registry supplemented the older World War II Veterans Twin Registry supported by the
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The new registry provided an opportunity to create
      a resource with Black and Hispanic twins as well as whites. The new registry also included
      data on greater educational, socioeconomic, and lifestyle diversity than was available in the
      World War II Veterans Twin Registry.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      During the first year a mailed questionnaire was designed which provided baseline data on
      family history, body size, morbidity, psychosocial characteristics, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, diet, physical activity, and drug use. The baseline data were used for analysis
      of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and blood diseases, and for follow-up. From the original
      survey, the Veterans Administration provided magnetic tape data on zygosity, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, heart, lung, and blood diseases, discharge rank, education, occupation, and
      family income. The questionnaire was completed by almost 8,900 individuals including over
      3,000 twin pairs.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;Completed Date&quot;
      entered in the Query View Report System (QVR).
