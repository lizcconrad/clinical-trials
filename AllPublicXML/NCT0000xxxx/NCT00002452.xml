  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if L-756423, an anti-HIV drug, is safe to give with
      indinavir and if it works well at lowering the level of HIV in the blood (viral load).

    <textblock>
      All patients receive L-756423 plus indinavir plus two licensed nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), at least one to which the patient is naive. Patients remain
      on the drug regimen for 12 weeks (with possible extension to 16 weeks). Patients are
      evaluated with physical examinations and laboratory tests for blood and urine at Weeks 1, 2,
      4, 6, 8, and 12 and two weeks post study. Plasma viral RNA is measured at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 12. CD4 cell counts are measured at Weeks 2,4,8, and 12.
