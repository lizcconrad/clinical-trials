  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of fluconazole (FCZ) and amphotericin B (AMB), alone
      or in combination with flucytosine (FLC), as treatment for acute cryptococcal meningitis in
      patients who have not been treated previously or who have relapsed after a previous
      successful treatment.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is an important cause of disease and death among patients with AIDS.
      Usually AMB is given either alone or with FLC to patients with this infection, but these
      treatments are not always effective and both have toxic effects. Animal studies and
      preliminary studies in humans show that FCZ is active in cryptococcal meningitis and suggest
      that it may be less toxic than either AMB or FLC.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is an important cause of disease and death among patients with AIDS.
      Usually AMB is given either alone or with FLC to patients with this infection, but these
      treatments are not always effective and both have toxic effects. Animal studies and
      preliminary studies in humans show that FCZ is active in cryptococcal meningitis and suggest
      that it may be less toxic than either AMB or FLC.

      Patients accepted into the study are randomly assigned to FCZ or AMB. Patients assigned to
      FCZ take FCZ by mouth daily for 10 weeks. Patients assigned to AMB are given intravenous
      injections of AMB daily for 6-10 weeks. Non-AIDS patients assigned to AMB also take FLC by
      mouth daily. The use of FLC in patients with AIDS is decided on an individual basis. Patients
      with AIDS who respond satisfactorily to FCZ receive maintenance therapy to prevent relapse
      for an additional 12 months. Patients with AIDS who respond to AMB may qualify for another
      Pfizer Central Research protocol. Patients without AIDS who respond to therapy are observed
      for 6 months for relapse. During therapy, samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (by lumbar
      puncture) are taken periodically in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug
      treatments and to identify possible toxic effects.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Immunosuppressant therapy.

          -  Cyclosporin plasma concentrations should be monitored and appropriate dosage
             adjustments made when used with amphotericin B or fluconazole.

          -  Antiviral therapy.

          -  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

          -  Treatment of intercurrent opportunistic infection as long as no investigational agent,
             or approved agent for an investigational indication, is used.

          -  Antipyretics, hydrocortisone, or meperidine to prevent or ameliorate side effects
             associated with amphotericin B.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

        - Radiation therapy for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.

        Patients must have:

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the patient or from the patient's legal
             guardian.

          -  One of the following:

          -  (1) Tentative identification of Cryptococcus neoformans in culture of lumbar
             cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results of baseline cultures need not be available when
             therapy is begun, but therapy is discontinued if the baseline CSF culture is later
             found to be negative for C. neoformans, or (2) Clinical and CSF findings (cell count,
             protein, glucose) compatible with cryptococcal meningitis plus one of the following:

          -  (a) Positive CSF India ink examination, (b) Culture or biopsy evidence of extraneural
             cryptococcal infection, (c) Positive serum of CSF cryptococcal antigen test, or
             increase in titer for previously treated patients with suspected relapse, or (d)
             Biopsy evidence of central nervous system cryptococcal infection.

          -  Treatment status of either no prior systemic antifungal therapy for cryptococcosis or
