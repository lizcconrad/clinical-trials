    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients with recurrent
      intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate to flavopiridol by patients with previously treated
      intermediate and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.

      II. Determine the toxicity of flavopiridol administered as a continuous infusion every 2
      weeks in these patients.

      III. Study the pharmacokinetics of flavopiridol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multi-institutional study.

      Patients receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Flavopiridol is administered as a
      continuous infusion over 72 hours every 2 weeks. Patients receive a minimum of 4 cycles of
      therapy unless unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurs. Patients are followed
      until death.
