      Fanconi's Anemia is an inherited disorder that can produce bone marrow failure. In addition,
      some patients with Fanconi's anemia have physical defects usually involving the skeleton and
      kidneys. The major problem for most patients is aplastic anemia, the blood counts for red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are low because the bone marrow fails to
      produce these cells. Some patients with Fanconi's anemia can develop leukemia or cancers of
      other organs.

      Many laboratory studies have suggested that Fanconi's anemia is caused by an inherited defect
      in the ability of cells to repair DNA. Recently, the gene for one of the four types of
      Fanconi's anemia, type C, has been identified. It is known that this gene is defective in
      patients with Fanconi's anemia type C.

      Researchers have conducted laboratory studies that suggest Fanconi's anemia type C may be
      treatable with gene therapy. Gene therapy works by placing a normal gene into the cells of
      patients with abnormal genes responsible for Fanconi's anemia type C. After the normal gene
      is in place, new normal cells can develop and grow. Drugs can be given to these patients kill
      the remaining abnormal cells. The new cells containing normal genes and will not be harmed by
      these drugs.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether researchers can safely place the normal
      Fanconi's anemia type C gene into cells of patients with the disease. The gene will be placed
      into special cells in the bone marrow called stem cells. These stem cells are responsible for
      producing new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive pancytopenia,
      congenital abnormalities, and predisposition to malignancy. Therapy is currently limited to
      allogeneic marrow transplantation; patients lacking a suitable donor usually die from aplasia
      or acute leukemia. Recently, mutation in a novel gene named FACC (Fanconi anemia
      C-complementing) has been identified as causing one type of FA. FACC mutations, which
      introduce splicing errors or stop codons, have been identified in 15% of FA patients. We have
      recently been successful in functional complementation of four FA cell lines using retroviral
      vectors to transfer a copy of the normal FACC gene. We also analyzed the ability of four
      viral vectors to functionally correct hematopoietic progenitor cells from a patient bearing a
      splice donor mutation. As for the lymphoid cell lines, these CD34 enriched cells were
      extremely sensitive to MMC. After injection of these progenitor cells with viral vectors
      bearing normal FACC, the progenitors gave rise to increased numbers of colonies both in the
      absence and presence of up to 5 nM MMC, whereas control cells were completely destroyed by 1
      nM MMC. In summary, we have demonstrated that: (1) retroviral vectors can be engineered to
      transfer a normal FACC gene to FA(C) lymphoid cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells; (2)
      introduction of a normal FACC gene into CD34+ progenitors markedly enhances their growth in
      the absence and presence of MMC.

      This study is designed to determine whether hematopoietic progenitors transduced with the
      normal FACC gene can be re-infused safely into FA(C) patients. CD34+ cells obtained from
      G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood will be transduced ex vivo over a 72 hour period in the
      presence of IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor with the FACC retroviral vector. These
      transduced cells will be re-infused into FA(C) patients. Patients will be monitored for
      toxicities as well as evidence of successful gene transfer and expression. The procedure will
      be repeated up to a total of 4 times with each treatment 2-4 months apart. Theoretically,
      these rescued stem cells should have a selective growth advantage within the hypoplastic FA
      marrow environment in vivo.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must meet the following criteria within 30 days prior to study entry (Day 0)
        unless otherwise noted.

        Males or females, age greater than or equal to 5 years of age.

        Diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, complementation group C, as confirmed by 1) Diepoxybutane or
        mitomycin C testing and 2) DNA analysis indicating FACC mutations.
