      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into head and neck cancer cells may make the
      body build an immune response to kill the tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet
      known whether the interleukin-2 gene is more effective than methotrexate for advanced head
      and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of the interleukin-2 gene
      with that of methotrexate in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory stage III or
      stage IV head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of interleukin-2 gene versus methotrexate in patients
      with recurrent or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the
      safety and tolerability of interleukin-2 gene in these patients. III. Compare the quality of
      life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 gene intratumorally on days 1 and 4 of
      week 1, and then once weekly for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive methotrexate IV once weekly. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is
      assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 5, 13, 17 and 25. Patients are followed
      every 2-3 weeks for up to 18 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
