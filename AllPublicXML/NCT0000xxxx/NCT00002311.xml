      To study the safety and efficacy of four different doses of Wobenzym (an enzyme combination
      consisting of pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, lipase, amylase, chymotrypsin, and
      rutin) in patients with HIV infection whose CD4 count is between 250 and 400 cells/mm3. To
      evaluate the effect of Wobenzym on certain surrogate markers associated with progression of
      HIV disease.
