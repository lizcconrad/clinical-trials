  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients whose parathyroid activity is elevated above normal are referred to as having
      hyperparathyroidism. This study will help researchers better understand the causes of
      hyperthyroidism and to evaluate and improve methods for diagnosis and treatment.

      In this study, patients diagnosed with or suspected of having hyperparathyroidism will be
      selected to participate. In addition, patients with related conditions such as parathyroid
      tumors, will also be selected.

      Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine for testing to confirm their condition.
      They will then be surgically treated by removal of the parathyroid gland(s)
      (parathyroidectomy).

      Subjects with parathyroid tumors will undergo several diagnostic tests to determine the exact
      location of the tumor as well as the tumor's activity. The tests may include; ultrasounds,
      nuclear scanning, CT scans, MRI, and specialized blood testing.

      Sometimes parathyroidectomy leads to hypoparathyroidism. Options for treating the patients
      after the surgical procedure will also be addressed. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are
      typically the mainstay of post parathyroidectomy therapy. Other potential treatments include
      transplanting the parathyroid gland(s) to other areas of the body.

      Patients with confirmed or suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or complications therefrom
      (such as postoperative hypoparathyroidism) will be admitted for diagnosis and treatment. The
      principal diagnostic components are calcium in serum and urine and parathyroid hormone in
      serum. Patients with moderately to highly severe primary hyperparathyroidism will be treated.
      Treatment will be mainly by parathyroidectomy. Other options are medications or no
      intervention. Patients with a hyperparathyroid syndrome may be managed for their
      extraparathyroid features. Preoperative testing to localize parathyroid neoplasm(s) will be
      used usually and with more extended methods in cases with prior neck surgery. Preoperative
      tumor localization tests will be selected according to clinical indications from the
      following: ultrasound, technetium-thallium scan, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance
      imaging, fine needle aspiration for parathyroid hormone assay, selective arteriogram,
      selective venous catheterization for parathyroid hormone assay. Options for management of
      postoperative hypocalcemia include calcium, vitamin D analogs, parathyroid autografts and
      synthetic parathyroid hormone. Research specimens may consist of blood or tumors.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients (male or female any age) with known or suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or a
        related disorder (such as familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [MEN1]) will be
        evaluated.

        The vast majority of patients will be greater than age 18.

        In the rare occasion where special resources might be appropriate (uremic patient, young
        child), the availability of special resources would be confirmed prior to admission.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        There are no absolute exclusions.
