      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine plus radiation therapy in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can not be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine in combination with
      radiation therapy to patients with locally advanced and/or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the
      pancreas. II. Determine the dose limiting toxic effects of this combination therapy in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the ability of these patients to tolerate induction and then
      maintenance therapy with gemcitabine preceding and following combination therapy. IV.
      Evaluate the efficacy (response rate, pattern of failure, and survival) of this combination
      therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Part I: Patients receive gemcitabine
      as a continuous infusion over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest.
      Part II: Gemcitabine IV is administered as a 30 minute infusion twice a week (Monday and
      Thursday) for 5-6 weeks. Patients receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. In
      the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 6 patients treated, subsequent
      cohorts of 6 patients each receive escalating doses of gemcitabine on the same schedule. If
      DLT occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next
      lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Part III: In the absence of toxicity and
      disease progression, patients continue gemcitabine for 3 additional courses. Maintenance
      gemcitabine starts 4 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy and is administered once
      weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 15-30 patients in approximately 24 months.
