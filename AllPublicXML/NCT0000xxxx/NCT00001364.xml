  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are abnormally formed blood vessels that can be located
      throughout the brain and spinal cord. Patients with abnormalities of the blood vessels
      located in and around the spinal cord can develop many neurological problems. Some problems
      include, weakness, pain, difficulty walking, paralysis, and even death.

      The treatment for these AVMs depends on their location, the type of malformation, the area of
      the spine involved, and the condition of the patient at the time of treatment. The treatment
      is aimed at stopping the neurologic problems from worsening and possibly correcting the
      existing problems. There are two commonly used treatments for AVMs, surgery and embolization
      (blocking off of blood flow to the AVM).

      However, researchers have limited experience treating these conditions because they are rare.
      In addition, it has been difficult to classify different kinds of AVMs and to develop new
      treatments for them.

      This study is designed to increase researchers understanding of AVMs by admitting and
      following patients diagnosed with the condition. By increasing the amount of patients studied
      diagnosed with spinal blood vessel abnormalities, researchers can begin to develop new
      management plans for patients with AVMs.

      Spinal Arteriovenous Malformations are rare lesions that frequently effect young patients and
      adults in their most productive years. They cause progressive myelopathy, ultimately causing
      paraplegia or quadriplegia if untreated. Because they are rare lesions, experience with
      treating them in sufficient numbers to permit classification of them, investigation of the
      pathophysiology of myelopathy, and the introduction of new techniques for treatment has been
      possible in only a very few centers in this country. One essential element of investigation
      of them is selective spinal arteriography. Since selective spinal arteriography was first
      introduced for these lesions here at the NIH in the mid 1960's by Drs. John Doppman and
      Giovanni DiChiro, the NIH has been such a center of expertise for patients with spinal
      arteriovenous malformations. Because of this, NIH has been, and is, a national referral
      center for these patients. However, there has never been an approved protocol at the NIH for
      investigation or treatment of these patients. The purpose of this proposal is to present a
      plan of investigation and treatment which will serve as a protocol under which to admit these
      patients and to permit continued accrual of clinical experience with them that will serve to
      guide others in the management of these patients.
