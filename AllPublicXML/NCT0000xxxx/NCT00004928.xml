      RATIONALE: Calcitriol may help prostate cancer cells develop into normal cells. Zoledronate
      may delay or prevent the formation of bone metastases. Combining calcitriol and zoledronate
      may be an effective treatment for progressive prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining calcitriol with zoledronate in
      treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol administered with zoledronate in
           patients with progressive prostate cancer.

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover in this
           patient population.

        -  Assess changes in PSA in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine other antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      Patients receive oral calcitriol weekly for 3 consecutive days and zoledronate IV monthly.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed prior localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has
             undergone definitive radiation or surgery and demonstrates progression biochemically
             with all of the following:

               -  Baseline PSA at least 4 ng/mL

               -  At least a 50% increase in PSA over at least 3 determinations taken at more than
                  2 week intervals

               -  No radiographically evident disease

               -  Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy
                  allowed

               -  Treatment in an intermittent approach allowed if off therapy for at least 12
                  weeks OR

          -  Histologically confirmed androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate with all
             of the following:

               -  Progression on primary hormonal treatment (e.g., orchiectomy, estrogen therapy,
                  gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog with or without an antiandrogen) with
                  either new osseous lesions in bone, a greater than 25% increase in
                  bidimensionally measurable tumor mass, or rising PSA values (rising PSA on any 3
                  determinations taken at at least weekly intervals, to greater than 50% above
                  baseline PSA) despite castrate levels of testosterone (no greater than 30 ng/mL)
