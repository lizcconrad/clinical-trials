      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of tin mesoporphyrin in patients with acute porphyria
      attacks who are also treated with a standard course of heme arginate.

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of tin mesoporphyrin when administered to these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an randomized, unblinded, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to receive heme arginate alone or both heme arginate and tin mesoporphyrin.

      Patients receive a single intravenous dose of tin mesoporphyrin immediately before the first
      dose of heme arginate. Heme arginate is administered daily for 4 days.

      Patients are followed at 3 and 6 days after treatment.
