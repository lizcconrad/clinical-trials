    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have
      metastatic kidney cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate to bryostatin 1 in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma.

      II. Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III.
      Determine the time to disease progression in patients receiving this treatment regimen.

      IV. Determine the overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every
      4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progresssion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
