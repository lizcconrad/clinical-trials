  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give HIV-positive patients
      L2-7001 (a type of interleukin-2) plus anti-HIV therapy. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a substance
      naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an important role in helping
      the body fight infection. IL-2 may be able to boost the immune systems of people with HIV
      infection.

      This study takes place in two phases. Phase A consists of an open-label dose-escalation of
      L2-7001 through four dose levels. Ascending dose cohorts of five patients are studied. The
      safety and tolerability of L2-7001 is assessed in preparation for the second phase of the
      study and to estimate an MTD. Phase B involves randomization of 190 patients to (a) one of
      three dose levels of L2-7001 plus ART, (b) one of two dosing levels of Proleukin plus ART, or
      (c) ART alone. L2-7001 and Proleukin are given SC every 12 hours for the first 5 days of an
      8-week cycle for three cycles. Serum IL-2 levels, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines are evaluated in 8 patients randomized to each treatment cohort of
      Phase B. All patients completing this phase of the protocol are eligible to be screened for
      enrollment in a maintenance use protocol which will allow for access to L2-7001.

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Have a viral load below 10,000 copies/ml.

          -  Have a CD4 count between 300 and 500 cells/mm3.

          -  Have been on stable anti-HIV therapy for 4 months. Patients must be taking at least 2
             drugs, 1 of which must be a protease inhibitor or a nonnucleoside drug (NNRTI).

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control, such as condoms, during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have an AIDS-defining illness. (Patients who have had an AIDS-defining illness that
             was cured may still be eligible.)

          -  Have an alcohol or drug abuse problem that the doctors feel would affect their ability
             to participate.

          -  Have a history of autoimmune disease.

          -  Have uncontrolled diabetes or certain thyroid problems.

          -  Have mental illness or other serious medical condition that the doctors feel would

          -  Have received IL-2 in the past.

          -  Have taken corticosteroids or certain medications that affect the immune system in the
             past 4 weeks.

          -  Have taken hydroxyurea in the past 4 months.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.
