      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      tumor cells from growing. Combining biological therapies with indomethacin and
      cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of indomethacin and biological therapy
      with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients who have advanced melanoma that has not
      responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether indomethacin given prior to tumor removal can increase the
      number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) obtained from the tumor specimen of patients
      with advanced melanoma. II. Determine the efficacy of administering concurrent indomethacin
      to maximize immune effector cell function in situ during interleukin-2/TIL therapy in these
      patients. III. Determine the relationship between the phenotypic character of TIL (generated
      in culture from the patient's tumor) and the response to therapy. IV. Correlate the lytic
      activity or lymphokine production of TIL (generated in culture from the patient's tumor) with
      clinical response to therapy. V. Generate and use lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in
      those patients who do not have TIL available for therapy and evaluate LAK cells in the same
      manner as TIL.

      OUTLINE: Patients with resectable tumors and with adequate generation of TIL are treated on
      Regimen A; those with unresectable tumors or insufficient TIL are treated on Regimen B. The
      following acronyms are used: CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 IL-2 Interleukin-2 (Cetus),
      NSC-373364 LAK Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells TIL Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Regimen
      A: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin;
      plus CTX; IL-2-activated TIL; IL-2. Regimen B: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus
      Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin; plus IL-2-activated LAK; IL-2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued over 3 years. If 0 of the first 10
      patients, no more than 1 of the first 15 patients, or no more than 2 of the first 20 patients
      respond, accrual will cease.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically documented melanoma that is metastatic or
        unresectable and unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy Measurable
        or evaluable disease required Measurable disease defined as bidimensionally measurable
        lesion on physical exam, x-ray, or MRI Evaluable disease defined as: Unidimensionally
        measurable lesion on x-ray, scan, or photograph Disease assessable by serial chemistries,
        tumor markers, or nonspecific scans Disease assessable by functional manifestations (e.g.,
        change in performance status, 10% or greater change in weight) Previously irradiated lesion
        with subsequent disease progression documented Bone-only lesions may be considered
        evaluable (lytic lesion on x-ray or bone scan should be followed) No metastases on CT or
        MRI involving more than 50% of the liver No uncontrolled or untreated CNS metastases
