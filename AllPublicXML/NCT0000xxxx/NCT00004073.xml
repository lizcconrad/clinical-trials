  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Suramin may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining suramin
      with radiation therapy may be a more effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of suramin plus radiation therapy in
      treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicity of suramin administered prior to and concurrent with
      radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioblastoma multiforme. II.
      Evaluate this regimen in terms of survival in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive suramin IV over 2 hours for initial dose and over 1 hour for
      subsequent doses daily for 5 days on week 1. Patients receive concurrent radiotherapy daily
      with suramin IV over 1 hour twice weekly on weeks 2-7. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease receive a second course of suramin twice weekly on weeks 20-24. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2
      months until disease progression or start of new therapy and then monthly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study over 1.5 years.
