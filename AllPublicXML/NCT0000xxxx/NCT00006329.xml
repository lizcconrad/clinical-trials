    <textblock>
      Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands that secrete a hormone which controls blood
      calcium levels. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) is a common disorder whereby one or more of
      these glands may enlarge and overproduce their hormone. Subsequently, the elevated blood
      calcium can cause many other symptoms and problems. The standard treatment is surgical
      removal of the gland(s) causing the disorder. The standard safe and effective operation has
      been the bilateral open parathyroid exploration (BOPE). A newer procedure using a radioactive
      compound that concentrates in the parathyroid glands allows a more limited operation to find
      and remove the causative gland [Minimally-Invasive Radioguided Parathyroidectomy (MIRP)]. The
      radiation exposure is minimal and safe. Although the operation may prove to be less
      expensive, it is not certain whether it is as effective or as safe as BOPE. This study serves
      to directly compare the costs, the effectiveness, and the safety associated with each type of
      operation. All patients (adolescents and older) with PH are candidates to participate. The
      participants will be randomly assigned to the MIRP group or the BOPE group independently of
      patient or physician preferences. MIRP patients will undergo a sestamibi nuclear medicine
      scan to attempt to localize the specific parathyroid gland causing the hyperparathyroidism
      and subsequently a limited operation under local anesthesia to remove the single gland.
      Parathyroid hormone levels will be measured during the operation to ensure that the patient
      has been cured. If not, the standard BOPE procedure will be completed. The total cost of the
      care will be tracked for each group. Careful testing for complications such as vocal cord
      dysfunction will be done. General Health status and pain levels will be measured before and
      after each operation. Patient satisfaction with the operation and care will also be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elevated serum calcium concentration on at least 2 occasions; if the value is &lt;11.0
             mg/dL, it must have been present for at least 6 months; if the serum albumin
             concentration is not normal, the ionized calcium level will be measured and must be
             elevated.
