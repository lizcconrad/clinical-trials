  <brief_summary>

      To determine the potential effects of 28 days of nevirapine treatment on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and of stavudine (d4T), and to further evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with nelfinavir, and d4T compared to the
      historical controls treated with nevirapine but without nelfinavir or d4T. To determine the
      efficacy of long-term combination therapy of nevirapine, nelfinavir and d4T on viral load in
      patients who are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and protease
      inhibitor naive, and have &lt;= 6 months prior d4T exposure at the time of screening.

      The trial is an open-label study in patients with HIV-1 infection who are naive to treatment
      with NNRTI and protease inhibitor classes of antiretroviral drugs and have &lt;= 6 months prior
      exposure to d4T at the time of screening. Part I of this trial is an investigation of
      potential pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and nelfinavir in HIV-1-infected
      adults treated with d4T. Part II is an investigation of the long-term antiviral activity of
      the combination of nevirapine and nelfinavir on viral load as measured by HIV-1 RNA.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

        Previous antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, didanosine, and
        dideoxycytidine.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Malabsorption, severe chronic diarrhea, or the inability to maintain adequate oral
             intake.

          -  Undergoing treatment for an active infection.

          -  Hepatic insufficiency due to cirrhosis.

          -  Renal insufficiency.

             1. Systemic treatment with corticosteroids or drugs known to be hepatic enzyme
             inducers or inhibitors within 14 days of entry. Substances in these categories
             include:

          -  macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, dirithromycin),
             azole antifungals (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole), rifampin, rifabutin, and
             phenytoin.

          -  Previous exposure to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as
             delavirdine, loviride, DMP 266, or nevirapine and/or protease inhibitors (PI) such as
             saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir.

          -  &gt; 6 months previous exposure to d4T.

          -  Investigational drugs within 30 days of first dose of study medication.

          -  Any antineoplastic agent within 12 weeks before starting study medication.

        Radiotherapy, other than local skin radiotherapy treatment, within 12 weeks prior to study.

        1. History of intravenous drug abuse or alcohol or substance abuse considered by the
        Investigator and BIPI Medical Monitor to be a significant impairment to health and
        compliance.

          -  Heavy smokers (e.g., &gt; 20 cigarettes per day).
