      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Phenethyl isothiocyanate may be effective in preventing
      lung cancer in smokers.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial of phenethyl isothiocyanate in preventing lung cancer in people who
      smoke.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral phenethyl isothiocyanate in
      smokers. II. Measure the steady state pharmacokinetics of phenethyl isothiocyanate required
      to maintain a steady state of this substance during the hours of
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) exposure in these patients. III. Obtain
      preliminary data on the perturbation of NNK metabolism by phenethyl isothiocyanate in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a questionnaire containing a smoking and dietary log to assess
      cigarette and cruciferous vegetable consumption. Patients receive phenethyl isothiocyanate
      orally 4 times a day for 30 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      phenethyl isothiocyanate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicities. Patients are followed on days 35, 36, and 43.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-6 months.
