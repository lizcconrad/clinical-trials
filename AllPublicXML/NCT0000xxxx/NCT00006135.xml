      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of long term suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir in infants
      with herpes simplex virus infection limited to skin, eyes, and mouth.

      II. Determine the neurologic outcome in these patients when treated with this regimen.

      III. Evaluate the significance of a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) result when all other CSF parameters remain normal in these patients.

      IV. Correlate the time to first positive CSF PCR result in the first 12 months of life with
      clinical neurological assessment in these patients when treated with this regimen.

      V. Determine whether the continuous administration of this drug suppresses recurrent skin
      lesions in these patients.

      VI. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

      All patients undergo a lumbar puncture and then receive acyclovir IV every 8 hours on Days
      1-14. On Day 12, patients may undergo a lumbar puncture (at discretion of investigator).
      Whole blood is obtained for herpes simplex virus PCR analysis. Upon completion of intravenous
      therapy, patients with a negative CSF PCR are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral acyclovir three times daily for 6 months.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo three times daily for 6 months.

      In case of cutaneous recurrence during the first 12 months of the study, patients receive
      open label oral acyclovir (if CSF PCR is negative) or acyclovir IV (if CSF PCR is positive)
      for 5 days. Patients may or may not continue on study drug following this treatment.

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of age.
