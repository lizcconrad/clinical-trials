  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the genetics involved in the development of lung disease
      by surveying genes involved in the process of breathing and examining the genes in lung cells
      of patients with lung disease.

      The study will focus on defining the distribution of abnormal genes responsible for processes
      directly involved in different diseases affecting the lungs of patients and healthy
      volunteers.

      Optional CT Sub-study

      The standard CT scan will be compared to the low dose radiation CT scan for the 150 subjects
      enrolled in the sub-study to assess the variation between the two techniques. Specifically,
      the quantitative computer aided detection of lung CT abnormalities from LAM can be compared
      to assess whether low radiation dose CT exams is an alternative to conventional CT to monitor
      disease

      status.

      This optional sub-study will be offered to up to 100 adult subjects with lung disease and up
      to 50 children age 9 and older with CF. Children will not be enrolled in the optional CT
      sub-study unless they have had a standard CT scan for medical purposes to use in comparison.
      One additional low dose radiation CT scan of the chest may be done as part of this sub-study
      when these subjects have their next annual CT scan.

      This study is designed to evaluate genetic mechanisms of lung disease by surveying
      polymorphic genes involved in respiratory function and examining gene expression in the lung
      cells of individuals with pulmonary disease (e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, history of infection,
      and genetic mutations consistent with lung pathology). Emphasis will be on defining the
      distribution of allelic variants of nitric oxide synthase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genes in patients and in age- and
      sex-matched healthy individuals in a control population.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion criteria for patients with AAT deficiency include: (1) Diagnosis of AAT with a
        confirmed phenotype considered in the high risk category; (2) Clinical phenotype consistent
        with potential genetic diseases and other genetic causes of lung diseases (3) symptoms
        consistent with pulmonary disease; (4) chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary disease; (5)
        pulmonary function tests consistent with pulmonary disease; (6) smokers, defined as
        individuals who are current smokers (1 pack per day for at least 2 years) and nonsmokers,
        defined as never-smokers or ex-smokers who have quit smoking three or more years ago;

        Inclusion criteria for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases include:

          1. symptoms consistent with pulmonary disease

          2. chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary disease

          3. pulmonary function tests consistent with pulmonary disease;

          4. smokers, defined as individuals who are current smokers (1 pack per day for at least 2
             years) and nonsmokers, defined as never-smokers or ex-smokers who have not smoked for
             three or more years.

        Inclusion criteria for patients with cystic fibrosis include a defined genetic mutation
        (i.e., any of the known variants of the CFTR gene, such as delta F508 allele) or a cystic
        fibrosis phenotype and clinical features consistent with this disease. Children with cystic
        fibrosis over eight years of age may be included.

        Patients with established diagnoses of sarcoidosis; mycobacterial infections; TSC (definite
        or possible); cystic lung diseases including genetic diseases; lymphangioleiomyomatosis or
        diseases associated with lymphatic disorders; history of pneumothorax; pulmonary fibrosis;
        asthma; histiocytosis X and diabetes mellitus will be included in this protocol. Relatives
        of patients may also be seen under this protocol. Children with lymphangiomatosis who are
        two years of age or older may be included.

        Research volunteers in the pulmonary control group are defined as individuals with no
        pulmonary disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis without evidence of pulmonary disease).
        Research volunteers in the diabetes control group are defined as individuals with no
        history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, or pulmonary disease.

        Because radiation exposure is not required, pregnant women are not excluded from the study.

        Patients with abnormalities in ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases,
        and their substrates. Children who are two years of age or older may be studied if they
        have a known defect in ADP-ribosylation, or if they have a family member with a defect in
        ADP-ribosylation and may be affected.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion criteria for all participants include:

          1. age less than 18 or greater than 90 except for NIH patients with diseases /disorders
             as described in this protocol (except cystic fibrosis, lymphangiomatosis or defects in
             ADP-ribosylation) who are 16 years of age or older, patients with cystic fibrosis who
             are over eight years of age, patients who are two years of age or older with
             lymphangiomatosis or a known defect in ADP-ribosylation, or who have a family member
             with a defect in ADP-ribosylation, or unless patient-specific IRB approval is obtained
             and;

          2. inability to obtain reliable pulmonary function testing. As clarification, healthy
             volunteers, relatives of patients (except as noted for an ADP-ribosylation defect),
             and asthmatic patients from Suburban Hospital will be excluded if less than 18 or
             greater than 90 years of age.

        An exclusion criteria for participating in the x-ray portion of the study is pregnancy.

        Exclusion criteria for participating in the bronchoscopy portion of the study are:

          1. presence of any contraindication for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with lavage and/or
             bronchial brushing;

          2. advanced stage of a pulmonary or a systemic illness such that the risk is judged to be
             significant even in the absence of a specific contraindication to the procedure

          3. allergy to topical anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine)

          4. current or recent respiratory infection (within the last 4 weeks)

          5. pregnancy or lactation

          6. age less than 18 or greater than 65.
