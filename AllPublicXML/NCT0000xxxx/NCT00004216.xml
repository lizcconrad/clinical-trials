      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as VNP20009 use different ways to stimulate the immune
      system and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP20009 in treating patients who have
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of intratumoral live,
      genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium (VNP20009) in patients with refractory,
      superficial solid tumors. II. Determine the efficacy of VNP20009 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive intratumorally injected live,
      genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium (VNP20009) on day 0. The tumor is biopsied on day
      14. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP20009 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or the optimal biologic dose (OBD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      highest dose in which no more than 1 patient in a cohort of 6 experiences dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT). The OBD is defined as the dose at which 3-6 patients of a cohort have greater
      than 10 million colony-forming units of VNP20009 per gram in the tumor biopsy. Prior to
      reaching the OBD, 2 to 3 additional patients may be entered at a previous dose level shown to
      be safe to undergo biopsy of the injected lesion between days 5 and 8. Patients are assessed
      for systemic tumor response 4-5 weeks after treatment. If the injected lesion is stable or
      responding, and non-injected lesions have not grown, patients may receive up to 2 additional
      courses of treatment. Patients receive one of the following antibiotic regimens upon evidence
      of progressive disease, DLT, or discontinuation from the study: First line: Ciprofloxacin IV
      or orally every 12 hours on day 1 then orally twice a day for 18 days Second line:
      Ceftriaxone IV on day 1 then cefixime orally for 16 days Third line: Co-trimoxazole orally
      twice a day for 21 days Patients are followed for an additional 4 weeks after initiation of
      antibiotic therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
