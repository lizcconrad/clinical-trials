      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Create a clinical sample bank of neonates with lung disease to test hypotheses regarding
      the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

      II. Determine whether a developmental deficiency of surfactant protein B (SP-B) contributes
      to the occurrence of respiratory distress and BPD in these patients.

      III. Study metabolic abnormalities associated with inherited deficiency of SP-B in these
      patients.

      IV. Determine whether plasma nitrotyrosine levels, a marker of peroxynitrite mediated oxidant
      stress, are elevated in premature infants who develop BPD.

      V. Measure the temporal changes in critical components of the inflammatory process (cell
      composition, inducible nitric oxide synthase, hyaluronan (HA), receptor for HA mediated
      mobility, and selected cytokines) in bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, and urine samples
      obtained from these patients, and to correlate these changes with their clinical course.

      VI. Examine changes in the insulin-like growth factor axis that occur in the lungs of infants
      with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and BPD.

      VII. Determine the relationship between degradation of elastin and the clinical course of
      BPD.

      VIII. Determine whether the normal fall in plasma endothelin-1 concentrations after birth are
      delayed in infants with RDS and BPD.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Bronchoalveolar lavage and urine samples are obtained from patients on day of life 0, 1, 3,
      7, 14, 21, and 28, and every 2 weeks thereafter until the infant is extubated. Serial blood
      samples are obtained from patients on day of life 0 (cord blood if possible), 1, 3, 7, 14,
      and 28, and prior to hospital discharge. Infants who require supplemental oxygen beyond 28
      days of life will have 3 additional blood samples obtained at 6, 8, and 12 weeks of life.
      Those infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia who are admitted to the hospital at
      over 4 weeks of age have plasma samples obtained at the time of admission, and every 2 weeks
      thereafter for a maximum total of 5 samples.
