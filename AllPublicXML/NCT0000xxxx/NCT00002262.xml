  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate tolerance, toxicity, and preliminary evidence of antitumor efficacy of
      intralesionally administered tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and to define a maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) for single intralesional injections. In addition, to assess the effects of TNF
      injections on Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions as measured by P-32 magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy.
