      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Based upon the organizational literature on adoption and institutionalization of innovative
      practices, a disseminable intervention protocol and materials (e.g., a guidebook for worksite
      health promotion steering committees) was developed. This intervention was evaluated in a
      randomized control trial comparing 13 treatment worksites to 13 delayed-treatment worksites
      on organizational health promotion practices (policies/environmental control, incentive
      programs, skills training activities, maintenance activities); employee smoking cessation and
      saturated fat consumption; and employee cholesterol levels. Following a two-year assessment,
      worksites in the delayed-treatment condition received a version of the intervention requiring
      less interventionist time. The effects of this streamlined intervention in these worksites
      were evaluated relative relative to a third group of 13 quasi-experimental comparison
      worksites that entered the study at that time.

      The study also evaluated the impact of organization characteristics and health promotion
      activities on employees at various stages of health related behavior change (awareness,
      intention to change, behavior change attempt, maintenance of behavior change). Process
      measures assessing program implementation and cost-effectiveness data were collected.
      Finally, the long-term intervention effects (3-4 years following initial intervention) on
      organizational health promotion practices, employee dietary and smoking behaviors, and
      cholesterol levels were assessed. In summary, this five year project provided both a)
      knowledge about how to implement worksite health promotion interventions to promote employee
      ownership and maintenance, and b) disseminable intervention products (e.g., protocols and
      employee steering committee guidebooks).
