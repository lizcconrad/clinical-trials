      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have
      recurrent or persistent ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of intraperitoneal administration of
      paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian or
      primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. Determine and confirm the maximum tolerated dose of this
      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine plasma paclitaxel concentrations at
      selected times after intraperitoneal administration of Paclimer microspheres in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intraperitoneal paclitaxel
      (Paclimer microspheres) every 8 weeks for 2 courses. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive
      escalating doses of intraperitoneal paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the probable MTD is determined, an
      additional cohort of 8 patients is accrued to confirm the MTD. The MTD is confirmed as the
      dose level at which at least 6 of 8 patients demonstrate acceptable safety and tolerability.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Recurrent or persistent ovarian and/or primary peritoneal
        carcinoma Adequate potential intraperitoneal fluid distribution with no gross fluid

        least 6 months Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3 WBC at least
