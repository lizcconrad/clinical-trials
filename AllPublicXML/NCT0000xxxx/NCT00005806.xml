      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZD 1839 given intermittently or
      continuously and concurrently with standard doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the safety of ZD 1839 in these
      regimens in these patients. III. Determine whether the exposure of either free carboplatin or
      paclitaxel in an established treatment regimen is significantly altered by the addition of
      oral ZD 1839 in this patient population. IV. Determine the exposure of ZD 1839 before and
      after standard doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel to assess whether ZD 1839 steady state is
      significantly altered by coadministration of chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, 2 part, multicenter study. Part 1 is a randomized, dose
      escalation, 2 period, 2 sequence, crossover design. Part 2 is a nonrandomized, single dose
      evaluation design. Part 1: Patients are randomized to receive ZD 1839 beginning 1 week before
      either the first (arm I) or second (arm II) course of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 1-14. On day 1 only, ZD 1839 is given twice at 12
      hour intervals. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes on days 8 and 36. Subsequent courses consist of ZD 1839 for 14 days and paclitaxel
      and carboplatin every 28 days. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm
      I on days 1 and 29. Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 22-35. On day 22 only, ZD
      1839 is given twice at 12 hour intervals. Subsequent courses are administered as in arm I.
      Part 2: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 1-56. On day 1 only, ZD 1839 is given
      twice at 12 hour intervals. Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in part 1 on days
      8 and 36. Subsequent courses consist of ZD 1839 continuously and paclitaxel and carboplatin
      every 28 days. Treatment continues in both parts for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In both parts 1 and 2, cohorts of 6-12 patients
      receive escalating doses of ZD 1839 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
