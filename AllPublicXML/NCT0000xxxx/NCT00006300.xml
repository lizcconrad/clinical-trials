  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are threefold: 1) to evaluate the prevalence and risks of oral
      complications in patients with aplastic anemia; 2) to evaluate if oral problems in these
      patients can predict their response to treatment; and 3) to review complications of dental
      treatment in these patients in order to establish treatment guidelines.

      This study will be performed through a review of medical charts of 79 patients with aplastic
      anemia and 67 patients with schizophrenia who were treated at the National Institutes of
      Health Dental Clinic between 1993 and 1999. The schizophrenia patients will serve as a
      control population.

      Demographic, clinical and radiographic information will be collected for all patients.
      Additional data collected only for aplastic anemia patients will include medical therapy,
      disease duration, blood cell counts, oral problems that developed during treatment and
      treatment response.

      The prevalence, risk factors and significance of oral manifestations in aplastic anemia have
      not been well characterized. Thus, in the present study, through a retrospective chart
      review, we document the prevalence of oral complications in AA patients and the risks for
      oral manifestations in a case-control study. Schizophrenic patients represent controls.
      Information includes the following; demographic, clinical and radiographic information for
      cases and controls. Additional data collection for only AA patients includes prior medical
      therapy, CBC and differential, disease duration, new oral manifestations during AA treatment
      and medical treatment response. We determine if systemic clinical features of AA predict oral
      manifestations, and if oral manifestations predict treatment outcomes for AA patients.
      Finally complications following dental treatment are compiled and reviewed to establish
      initial treatment guidelines for these patients.
