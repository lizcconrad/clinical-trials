  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose study currently
      being conducted on two geropsychiatric units at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. It
      seeks to evaluate the short-term safety and efficacy of citalopram and perphenazine in the
      treatment of 112 patients suffering from behavioral disturbances associated with dementia.
      Findings from this research may directly lead to improved acute pharmacotherapy for psychosis
      and behavioral problems in patients diagnosed with dementia. Improved treatment of behavioral
      complications with reduced side effects would reduce excess disability in patients diagnosed
      with dementia, allowing them to be maintained in the community for greater periods of time.

      The principal investigator is conducting an inpatient study at Western Psychiatric Institute
      and Clinic involving two medications for treatment of emotional and behavioral disturbances
      that may accompany dementia. In this study, 112 patients will be enrolled for up to 17 days
      in order to investigate the safety and effectiveness of both medications. Forty-two of these
      patients will be given a recently FDA-approved antidepressant medication called citalopram
      and 42 will receive one of our current, usual antipsychotic medications called perphenazine.
      An additional 28 patients will be given non-active placebo capsules. Which treatment a
      patient is given during the study will be determined by chance. Findings from this
      investigation may directly lead to the improvement of symptoms such as: agitation, hostility,
      suspiciousness, hallucinations, and unusual thoughts. Improved treatment of problematic
      behaviors and a decrease in medication-associated side effects would enable dementia patients
      to be cared for in their home environments for longer periods of time.

             dementia (VD), mixed (AD and VD) or dementia NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)

          -  Presents with psychosis or behavioral problems severe enough to endanger the patient's
             health, well-being or safety, as evidenced by a score of at least 3 (moderate) on one
             of the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS) agitation items (8,11,14) or psychosis
             items (16,18,20) and are not secondary to physical illness nor amenable to
             environmental optimization

          -  Able to participate in study evaluations and ingest oral medication

          -  Has next of kin or a guardian available to consent to patient's participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has an unstable medical illness including significant cardiac (specifically

             drug washout prior to entering the protocol)

          -  Is currently being treated with cognitive enhancing drugs (Tacrine or Aricept) or any
             experimental drug

          -  Has a concurrent diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression
