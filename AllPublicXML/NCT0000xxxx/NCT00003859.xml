      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether undergoing surgery plus radiation therapy is more effective with or
      without chemotherapy for primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the CNS.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery plus radiation
      therapy with or without chemotherapy in treating patients who have primitive neuroectodermal
      tumors of the CNS.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether chemotherapy utilizing carboplatin, vincristine,
      cyclophosphamide, and etoposide improves the prognosis for children with primitive
      neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system when given after surgery and before
      radiotherapy. II. Assess prospective factors that may determine ultimate prognosis in this
      patient population. III. Determine the quality of survival of these patients on both
      treatment regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients undergo surgical removal of the primary tumor.
      Following surgery, patients are randomized to receive radiotherapy alone (arm I) or
      chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (arm II). Arm I: Patients begin receiving radiotherapy
      as soon as possible after surgery, within 28 days. Radiotherapy is administered 5 times a
      week for 6 weeks. Arm II: Within 28 days of surgery, patients receive vincristine IV on days
      1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63. Carboplatin IV is administered over 1 hour on days
      1, 2, 42, and 43. Etoposide IV is administered over 1 hour on days 1-3, 21-23, 42-44, and
      63-65. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered over 4 hours on days 21 and 63. As soon as
      possible after chemotherapy, patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I. Quality of life is
      assessed every 3 months for the first year and annually thereafter. Patients are followed
      every 6 weeks for the first year, every 3 months for the second year, every 4 months for the
      third year, and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
