      RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as the use of gadolinium texaphyrin with MRI may
      improve the ability to detect the extent of gliomas.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gadolinium texaphyrin used with
      MRI-guided surgery in treating patients with high-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gadolinium texaphyrin as a tumor
      retained contrast agent in MRI guided neurosurgery in patients with radiological diagnosis of
      high grade glioma. I. Determine the intratumoral pharmacology and quantitative
      pharmacokinetics of gadolinium texaphyrin using MRI imaging in these patients. II. Develop a
      scale that will relate MRI signal characteristics from intratumoral gadolinium texaphyrin
      with absolute intratumoral levels of gadolinium texaphyrin in these patients. III.
      Investigate the distribution of gadolinium texaphyrin in high grade gliomas in comparison
      with biologically active tumor as delineated by elevated choline-containing material detected
      by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin by IV
      infusion 20 minutes to 2 hours prior to magnetic resonance imaging and surgery. The maximum
      tolerated dose for a single dose of gadolinium texaphyrin is determined by cohorts of 3
      patients who are treated at one of five escalating doses. Patients in each cohort are
      followed for a minimum of 4 weeks each before the next cohort begins. If good contrast
      enhancement is assessed at the fourth dose level (cohort 4), dose escalation stops. Patients
      are followed at days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at 3 months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued into this study.
