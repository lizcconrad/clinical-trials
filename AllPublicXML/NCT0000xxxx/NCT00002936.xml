      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of altretamine plus etoposide in treating
      patients with HIV-related cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine toxic effects of repeated courses of altretamine plus etoposide at
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). II. Assess the response duration and time to progression at
      the MTD in the treatment of HIV malignancies. III. Assess the efficacy of the combination on
      the immune systems of these individuals. IV. Assess the effect of the combination on the
      quality of life in these individuals.

      OUTLINE: Patients are treated with altretamine (HMM) and etoposide for 2 weeks followed by 2
      weeks of rest. This cycle is repeated for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 cycles if there
      is no progression of disease. Patients who are in complete remission receive an additional 2
      cycles (total of 8 cycles). There are different cohorts consisting of 4 patients each in
      which toxic effects will be evaluated with escalating doses of this combination. The MTD is
      defined as the dose level immediately below that at which half of the patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for relapse and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be accrued in 2 years.
