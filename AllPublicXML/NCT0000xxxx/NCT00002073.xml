  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of erythropoietin administered subcutaneously to AIDS
      patients with anemia secondary to their disease and/or concomitant zidovudine (AZT) therapy.
      Efficacy will be assessed by correction of anemia and decrease in transfusion requirements.
