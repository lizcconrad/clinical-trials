      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy followed by
      surgery and additional chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced nonmetastatic
      primary cancer of the rectum. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be an
      effective treatment for rectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of oxaliplatin
      when combined preoperatively with concurrent radiation therapy (XRT) and fluorouracil (5-FU)
      by PVI.

      II. To evaluate the resection rate for T4 rectal cancers, the pathologic CR rate for T3 and
      T4 rectal cancers, and the expected versus actual type of resection (APR vs. LAR vs.
      LAR/coloanal anastomosis).

      III. To make preliminary observations of patient survival and patterns of recurrence for this
      treatment combination.

      IV. To evaluate anastomotic and sphincter function following pre-op combined modality
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of preoperative oxaliplatin.

      Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously with concurrent radiotherapy for 5.5 weeks.
      Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, and 5.

      Cohorts of 5 patients each receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients undergo surgery 6-8 weeks after completing preoperative chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. The surgical procedure is determined by the extent of the tumor before
      preoperative therapy. The type of operative procedure may be abdominoperineal resection, low
      anterior resection (LAR), or LAR/coloanal anastomosis.

      Postoperative chemotherapy begins within 6 weeks after surgery, comprising leucovorin calcium
      and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2.5 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually
      for 5 years.
