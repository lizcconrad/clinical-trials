      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose etoposide and
      cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and activity of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, total body
      irradiation, and autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with relapsed or
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the feasibility of pretransplantation
      cytoreduction with a regimen of high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone in this
      patient population. III. Determine the feasibility of posttransplantation radiotherapy given
      to sites of residual disease (involved-field &quot;boost&quot; irradiation) in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease status (refractory vs relapsed). Autologous bone
      marrow is harvested before cytoreduction or involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). Patients with
      marrow involvement who achieve marrow complete response after cytoreduction undergo harvest
      of bone marrow before IFRT. Patients receive cytoreduction comprising high-dose cytarabine IV
      over 1 hour every 12 hours, cisplatin IV over 10 hours, and dexamethasone three times daily
      on days 1 and 2. At 3 weeks, a second course is administered if tumor reduction is at least
      25% and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with involved sites 2 cm or greater
      in diameter at evaluation and previously unirradiated active disease sites, at least 90% of
      which can be treated with IFRT, undergo IFRT 5 days a week for 2 weeks beginning after
      cytoreduction and 3-5 weeks after harvest of bone marrow. Within 10 days after completion of
      IFRT, patients receive etoposide IV over 26 hours beginning on day -7, cyclophosphamide IV
      over 2 hours on days -6 to -4, and total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 and -2 and
      once on day -1. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Eligible patients with residual disease at
      3 months after transplantation undergo involved field &quot;boost&quot; irradiation to sites of
      residual disease.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven or unequivocal radiologic evidence of
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has relapsed or is refractory after first-line chemotherapy
        Unequivocal radiologic evidence of relapse defined as the presence of enlarged (at least 2
        cm diameter) lymph nodes by CT scan or lymphangiogram Biopsy of accessible lymph nodes to
        confirm relapse encouraged Low-, intermediate-, or high-grade disease Normal bilateral bone
        marrow biopsy at time of bone marrow collection required (cellularity at least 20% and no
        histologic evidence of tumor) History of marrow involvement allowed if present marrow is
        histologically normal No disease progression in a previously irradiated site A new
        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.
