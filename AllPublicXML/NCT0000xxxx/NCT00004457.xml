      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine specific clinical features, molecular abnormalities, and laboratory-based
      biological markers of free radical stress that are associated with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis and influence disease severity.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a screening and diagnostic study. Blood and urine samples are
      collected from patients every 2 months for 1 year. All samples are evaluated for measures of
      free radical damage and levels of the body's own antioxidant activity.
