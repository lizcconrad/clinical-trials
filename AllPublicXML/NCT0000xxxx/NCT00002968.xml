    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without monoclonal
      antibody therapy in treating patients who have stage II colon cancer. Monoclonal antibodies
      such as edrecolomab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether surgery to
      remove colon cancer is more effect with or without monoclonal antibody therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether adjuvant treatment with MoAb 17-1A will improve the probability of
      overall and disease-free survival, and increase disease-free intervals in patients who have
      undergone resection of a Stage II colon cancer.

      II. To determine whether alterations in the expression of cell cycle related genes
      (thymidylate synthase, p53, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27) predict
      the risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.

      III. To determine whether alterations in markers of metastatic potential-expression of DCC
      and measures of tumor angiogenesis (microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth
      factor expression)-predict the risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.

      IV. To determine whether a marker of cellular differentiation-sucrase isomaltase-predicts the
      risk of survival and recurrence in this patient population.

      V. To determine whether DNA ploidy and cell proliferation are prognostic of tumor recurrence
      and overall survival in Stage II colon cancer.

      VI. To determine whether interactions among these tumor markers identify subsets of patients
      with significantly altered outcome.

      VII. To determine whether pathologic features including tumor grade; tumor mitotic
      (proliferation) index; tumor border configuration; host lymphoid response to tumor; and
      lymphatic vessel, venous vessel and perineural invasion predict outcome in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to degree of
      differentiation (well vs moderately well vs poor), vascular or lymphatic invasion (no vs
      yes), and preoperative serum CEA (less than 5.0 ng/mL vs at least 5.0 ng/mL vs unknown).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant edrecolomab IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 5 courses. Patients must begin therapy no earlier than 7 days and no later
      than 42 days post-surgical resection. Patients also undergo observation at 3 and 6 months
      post-randomization.

      Arm II: Patients undergo observation at 3 and 6 months post-randomization.

      Patients are followed after the last course of edrecolomab (arm I) and at 12 months (arm II).
      All patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon with or without penetration of
             the serosa with no lymph node metastases (Stage II pT3N0 or pT4bNO lesions, excluding
             pT4aN0; Modified Astler-Coller Stage B2); there can be no distant metastases or
             penetration of adjacent organs or structures; proximal, distal, and radial margins
             must be free of tumor Important note: A tumor nodule &gt; 3 mm in diameter in the
             perirectal or pericolonic adipose tissue without histologic evidence of residual node
             in the nodule is classified as regional/pericolonic node metastasis; however, a tumor
             nodule =&lt; 3 mm in diameter is classified in the T category as discontinuous extension
             (i.e., pT3); multiple metastatic foci seen microscopically only in the pericolonic fat
             should be considered as metastasis in a single lymph node for classification; although
             six or more nodes evaluated from the specimen is optimal, a minimum of three nodes
             (periodic or mesenteric) for evaluation is required for inclusion in the study

          -  Complete, en bloc resection of all the primary tumor, performed as an open procedure,
             and not laparoscopically or laparoscopically assisted

          -  No evidence of perforation or clinical obstruction of the bowel

          -  The gross distal margin of the primary tumor must lie above the peritoneal reflection
             (i.e., it must be a colon, not a rectal cancer)

          -  No previous radiation or chemotherapy for this malignancy

          -  CALGB Performance status 0-1

          -  No concurrent treatment with systemic steroids is allowed; patients receiving
             replacement steroids for adrenal insufficiency are eligible; patients receiving
             inhaled steroids in daily doses of 500mg or less and patients being treated with
             topical steroids are eligible

          -  No prior exposure to murine antibodies (e.g., diagnostic tests like the &quot;oncoscint
             scan&quot;)

          -  No uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease

          -  No history of pancreatitis

          -  Non-pregnant and non-lactating; patients of child-bearing potential should agree to
             use an effective method of birth control

          -  No previous or concurrent malignancy is allowed, except inactive non-melanoma skin
             cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other cancer if the patient has been
             disease-free for &gt;= 5 years; patients with more than one synchronous primary colon
             tumor are eligible; for the purpose of this protocol, staging classification will be
             based on the stage of the more advanced primary tumor

          -  Granulocytes &gt; 1,800/μl

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/μl
