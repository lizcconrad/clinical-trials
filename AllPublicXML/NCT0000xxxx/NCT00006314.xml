      To investigate the relationship between HCMV and bone marrow progenitor cells to understand
      whether HCMV is latent in CD34 + bone marrow progenitors and the mechanism by which the virus
      remains in a latent state.

      BACKGROUND:

      Despite progress in understanding the pathophysiology of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
      infections, its manifestations in the immune compromised host are frequently associated with
      high morbidity and mortality. In this setting, HCMV disease can develop e.g. following immune
      suppression as a result of reactivation of latent HCMV acquired earlier in life. The
      mechanisms leading to establishment of latent infections and their subsequent reactivation
      are not clear. It is also unknown whether HCMV exists in a latent form with limited viral
      gene expression or as a persistent infection with normal virus transcription.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The specific aims of the study were to: 1) examine the percentage of HCMV positive donors
      whose bone marrow progenitors contained HCMV DNA using nested PCR and determine if virus
      could be rescued from those cells. 2) Analyze the HCMV life cycle in hematopoietic progenitor
      and stem cells. 3) identify and analyze HCMV gene expression in in vivo infected leukocytes.
      Bone marrow progenitors containing HCMV DNA detectable by nested PCR were isolated from human
      donors and used as as source of mRNA to prepare Cdna libraries. 4) Determine if gene(s)
      expressed in bone marrow progenitors were important in either establishing or maintaining a
      latent infection or in the lytic cycle of HCMV. Information provided from the above studies
      yielded information important in planning future approaches for the therapy of HCMV
      infections.
