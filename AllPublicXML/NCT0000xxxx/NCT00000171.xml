  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a multicenter clinical trial of melatonin for sleep disturbances associated
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Frequent nocturnal awakening is a common behavioral symptom of
      AD. Nighttime wandering and agitated behavior may result in injuries and sleep disruption for
      caregivers. Alternatives are sorely needed to the currently available sleep medications that
      have marginal efficacy and serious side effects. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone
      secreted by the pineal gland. It has soporific effects with oral administration and is well
      tolerated. It enhances sleep in normal older people. Melatonin also may help sleep
      disturbances associated with AD; however, this remains to be proven.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Alzheimer's disease , sleep disruption is one of the most common behavioral problems,
      occurring in 45 percent of patients. These nocturnal awakenings and agitation lead to
      considerable burden for caregivers and frequently lead families to the decision of nursing
      home placement. The proposed study is a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo
      controlled, clinical trial. Placebo will be compared with two doses of melatonin: a 2.5 mg,
      slow- release preparation and a 10 mg immediate release preparation. One hundred and fifty
      community-residing AD patients with disrupted sleep will be recruited. Included subjects will
      meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Prior to study entry, disrupted sleep will be
      documented by clinical history and by 1 to 2 weeks of recording using wrist activity
      monitors. The treatment period will last 8 weeks. Rest/activity patterns will be recorded by
      wrist activity monitors. The primary outcome measure will be the change in nocturnal sleep
      time from baseline to the end of the treatment phase.

      Other outcomes also will be examined, including the time awake after sleep onset, sleep
      latency, sleep efficiency, daytime agitation, and changes in cognition. The relative
      effectiveness of high and low dose melatonin will be assessed. Adverse events and side
      effects will be compared by treatment. This study should provide the data necessary to
      determine whether melatonin is a safe and effective treatment for disrupted sleep associated
      with AD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD).
             Patients must have disrupted sleep, documented by clinical history and by 1 to 2 weeks
             of recording using wrist activity monitors.

          -  A diagnosis of probable AD.

          -  MMSE score 0-26.

          -  Hachinski Ischemia Scale score less than or equal to 4.

          -  A 2-week history of two or more sleep disorder behaviors, occurring at least once
             weekly, as reported by the caregiver on the Sleep Disorder Inventory.

          -  CT or MRI since the onset of memory problems showing no more than one lacunar infarct
             in a non-strategic area and no clinical events suggestive of stroke or other
             intracranial disease since the CT or MRI.

          -  Physically acceptable for study as confirmed by medical history and exam, clinical
             laboratory results, and EKG.

          -  Actigraph evidence of a mean nocturnal sleep time of less than 7 hours per night (at
             least 5 nights of complete actigraph data must be collected over a single week.

          -  Stable home situation with no planned move during the 13-week investigational period.

          -  Residing with responsible spouse, family member, or professional caregiver who is
             present during the night and will agree to assume the role of the principal caregiver
             for the 13-week protocol, including arranging transport for the patient to and from
             the investigators' clinic, answering questions regarding the patient's condition, and
             assuming responsibility for medication and actigraph procedures.

          -  Ability to ingest oral medication and participate in all scheduled evaluations.

          -  Six grades of education or work history sufficient to exclude mental retardation.

          -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 15 or less.

          -  Stable medication (dose and type) for non-excluded concurrent medical conditions for 4
             weeks prior to the screening visit.

             and only one alcoholic drink after 6:00 pm for the duration of the protocol.
