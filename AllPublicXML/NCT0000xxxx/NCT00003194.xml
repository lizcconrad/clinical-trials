      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of thiotepa in combination with carboplatin and
           topotecan with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with recurrent or
           refractory pediatric solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of thiotepa.

      Patients may receive 2 courses of mobilization comprising cyclophosphamide and etoposide with
      filgrastim (G-CSF) support and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.

      Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 1; topotecan IV over 30 minutes on
      days 0-4; and carboplatin IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3. Patients also receive G-CSF
      beginning on day 5, 24-36 hours following the last dose of topotecan. PBSC are reinfused on
      day 6 (36-48 hours following the last dose of topotecan) of each course of therapy. Patients
      receive 3 courses of therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of thiotepa until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued into this study.
