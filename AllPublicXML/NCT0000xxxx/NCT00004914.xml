      RATIONALE: Exercise may decrease anemia-related fatigue, improve strength, and build up lost
      muscle tissue. Epoetin alfa may help improve cancer-related anemia, energy levels, and
      quality of life. Exercise plus epoetin alfa may be effective treatment for anemia-related
      fatigue.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exercise plus epoetin alfa in treating
      cancer patients who have anemia-related fatigue.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of progressive resistance training and epoetin alfa on
      lean body mass, fatigue, exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and total body weight in
      cancer patients with anemia related fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo progressive resistance training (PRT) consisting of 3 sets of 8
      repetitions of concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) exercises over 4-6 seconds each
      using bench press, arm pull, knee extension, knee flexion, and double leg press followed by
      1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Patients undergo warm up and cool down periods over 10
      minutes prior to and following PRT. Patients perform PRT 3 times a week for 12 weeks.
      Patients also receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly over 4-12 weeks in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 15 months.
