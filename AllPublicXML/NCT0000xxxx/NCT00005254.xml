      The Veterans Administration Patient Study examined the progression of peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) in patients with large vessel PAD or isolated small vessel PAD. The Community
      Follow-up Study following subjects with and without PAD from a previous cohort to determine
      subsequent coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

      BACKGROUND:

      Peripheral arterial disease is a common condition, particularly in the elderly, but is the
      least frequently studied and the least well understood of the major atherosclerotic diseases.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Veterans Administration Patient Study: The progression of PAD was followed in patients
      diagnosed at the San Diego VA Medical Center from July 1984 to June 1989. Four non-invasive
      tests used in the initial diagnosis were repeated after a five year interval. The tests
      included segmental blood pressure flow velocity by Doppler ultrasound, post-occlusive
      reactive hyperemia, and pulse reappearance time. Risk factors examined for related to PAD
      included cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure,
      fasting plasma glucose, diabetes history, immunoglobulin E, and creatinine. The degree of
      concordance between PAD and carotid disease was evaluated using phonoangiography.

      Community Follow-up Study: The study was conducted in a cohort first examined for PAD in
      1978-1981 and followed for morbidity and mortality.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
