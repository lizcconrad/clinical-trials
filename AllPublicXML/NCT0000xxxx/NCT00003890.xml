      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MG98 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MG98 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Assess the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this
           patient population.

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive MG98 IV over 2 hours twice weekly for 3 weeks. Courses are repeated every 4
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The dose of MG98 is escalated in cohorts of 1-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at week 4, then at least every 3 months until relapse of disease.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-12
      months.
