  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics profile of single doses of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in patients
      with AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea. To determine steady state concentrations of NTZ
      following repeated dosing. To assess the safety and efficacy of 4 dose levels of NTZ in these
      patients.

      Cryptosporidial enterocolitis in AIDS patients is frequently chronic and severe, contributing
      substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in this population. NTZ exhibits
      antimicrobial activity that may extend to Cryptosporidial infection.

      Cryptosporidial enterocolitis in AIDS patients is frequently chronic and severe, contributing
      substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in this population. NTZ exhibits
      antimicrobial activity that may extend to Cryptosporidial infection.

      Patients are enrolled in groups of 7. Group A receives the lowest dose of NTZ. Groups B - D
      receive sequentially higher doses. Patients in Groups B - D do not begin therapy until all
      patients have been enrolled at the preceding dose. For determination of single-dose
      pharmacokinetics, patients receive a single dose of NTZ on Day 1 and blood samples are
      obtained over the next 24 hours. Immediately following the 24-hour blood sample collection,
      patients begin the treatment phase during which they take NTZ for an additional 13 days.
      Blood samples are obtained again on Day 14 to determine full plasma concentration-time
      profiles over the dosing interval. At the end of treatment, responders discontinue treatment
      and nonresponders continue NTZ treatment for an additional 14 days on the same dose. Patients
      who still fail to respond are provided with an additional month of NTZ. Patients have
      scheduled visits for clinical and parasitologic efficacy assessments and safety laboratory
      tests.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  AIDS diagnosis according to CDC criteria.

          -  CD4 count less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 or CD4 count greater than or equal to
             200 cells/mm3 and documented cryptosporidiosis for a minimum of 4 weeks.

          -  Cryptosporidial diarrhea as defined by:

          -  (1) presence of Cryptosporidium oocytes in a stool specimen within 14 days of
             enrollment; and (2) chronic diarrhea (i.e., an average of at least 4 bowel movements
             per day for a minimum of 2 weeks).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 1 month.

          -  Ability to tolerate food by mouth.

        Prior Medication:

        Required:

          -  Any anti-diarrheal or anti-emetic medication for which the dosage regimen has been
             stable for at least 1 week prior to enrollment.

          -  Any antiretroviral medications (e.g., zidovudine, ddI, ddC) for which the dosage
             regimen has been stable for at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Allowed:

        Medication for prophylaxis or maintenance therapy of opportunistic infection, stable for at
        least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

        Grade 4 (hematologic) or Grade 3 (for all others) toxicity. (Patients with Grade 3 toxicity
        for hepatic parameters may be enrolled if, in the investigator's judgment, the
        abnormalities are due to biliary cryptosporidiosis.)

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Presence of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba
             histolytica, Microsporidia, Isospora, Cyclospora, or Clostridium difficile toxin in
             stool (based on assessment within 14 days prior to enrollment by stool ova and
             parasite examination, culture, and C. difficile assay).

          -  History of intestinal Mycobacterium avium intracellular infection or intestinal
             Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  History of Cytomegalovirus colitis, unless 28 days of therapy with ganciclovir or
             foscarnet completed subsequent to diagnosis.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Investigational drug therapy within 14 days of enrollment, unless available under an
             FDA-authorized expanded access program.

          -  Any drug or therapy with possible anticryptosporidial activity (e.g., paromomycin,
             spiramycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, hyperimmune bovine colostrum) within 14 days
             of enrollment.
