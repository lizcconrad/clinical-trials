      To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of biweekly administration of
      aerosol pentamidine versus placebo when used as a prophylactic agent in patients who have
      recovered from their first episode of AIDS-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT). If AZT is started during the study, patients must have received = or
             &gt; 15 days of aerosol pentamidine before beginning AZT.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT). If AZT began prior to study entry, patients must have received = or
             &gt; 15 days of AZT before beginning aerosol pentamidine.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Requiring ongoing active therapy for an opportunistic infection (O.I.) at time of
             entry or those with either of the following AIDS-defining O.I.'s prior to entry:

          -  Toxoplasmosis.

          -  Cryptococcosis.

          -  Transfusion dependent (requiring blood transfusion more than once per month). The last
             transfusion cannot have been given within 7 days of study entry.

          -  Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

          -  Uncontrolled asthma.

          -  Active therapy for tuberculosis.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Requiring ongoing active therapy for an opportunistic infection (O.I.) at time of
             entry or those with either of the following AIDS-defining O.I.'s prior to entry:

          -  Toxoplasmosis.

          -  Cryptococcosis.

          -  Transfusion dependent (requiring blood transfusion more than once per month). The last
             transfusion cannot have been given within 7 days of study entry.

          -  Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

          -  Uncontrolled asthma.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 30 days of study entry:

          -  Antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Immunomodulating agents.

          -  Corticosteroids.

        Active therapy for tuberculosis.

        Patients must:

          -  Have AIDS and recovered from their first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
             (PCP).

          -  Be at least 2 weeks and no more than 24 weeks status post therapy for acute PCP.

          -  Have positive antibody to HIV by a Government-approved ELISA test kit, or confirmed
             Western blot test.

          -  Adequate pulmonary function (vital capacity = or &gt; 80 percent of predicted; forced
             expiratory volume (FEV), 1 s = or &gt; 65 percent of total FEV; and corrected pulmonary
             diffusion capacity &gt; 60 percent of predicted).

          -  Free of acute medical problems.

        Active substance abuse.
