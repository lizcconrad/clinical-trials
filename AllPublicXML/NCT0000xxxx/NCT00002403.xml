  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give zintevir (AR177) to
      asymptomatic (no symptoms) HIV-infected patients.

      Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. HIV uses the
      protein integrase to infect a cell. Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop
      replication of HIV.

      Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. The HIV-1 virus
      uses the protein integrase to incorporate its genetic material into the infected host cell.
      Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of the HIV-1 virus.

      In this open-label, Phase I/II study, 3 groups of HIV-positive patients (12 patients total)
      receive escalating doses of intravenous zintevir for 14 consecutive days.
