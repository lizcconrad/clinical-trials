  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of giving lymphocytes (white blood cells) containing a
      new gene to HIV-infected individuals and will determine how long the cells survive in the
      bloodstream. Although the genetically altered cells will not directly benefit participants,
      knowledge about the safety, side effects and survival of these gene-marked cells in
      HIV-infected patients may lead to new treatment strategies.

      Identical twin pairs 18 years of age and older-one infected with HIV, the other
      non-infected-may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history, physical examination and blood tests.

      All participants will have a tetanus booster shot. Non-infected twins will undergo a
      procedure called apheresis to collect white blood cells. For this procedure, whole blood is
      collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is separated
      it into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the white cells are removed, and the
      rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another
      needle in the other arm. The harvested white cells will be grown in culture for approximately
      10 days to 2 weeks to increase their numbers up to 1000-fold. A gene called NeoR, which is
      derived from bacteria, will be inserted into the cells, and these gene-marked cells will be
      infused into the HIV-infected twin.

      HIV-infected twins will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first cell infusion.
      The gene-marked cells will be infused over a 60-minute period through a plastic tube
      (catheter) placed in an arm vein, or, if a suitable arm vein cannot be found, through a
      special catheter placed into a large vein in the neck or chest. Vital signs (temperature,
      pulse, blood pressure and breathing rate), blood oxygen concentration, and urine output will
      be monitored regularly for 24 hours. Blood samples will be collected before and after the
      infusion to monitor for gene-marked cells. Patients will be discharged the next day. They
      will return to NIH daily the first week (from Monday through Thursday) to monitor for CD4
      cell counts, plasma viral burden, p24 antigen levels, HIV levels and the presence of the NeoR
      gene, and then weekly for the next 5 weeks for these tests and others to monitor blood and
      urine chemistry, blood counts and immune function markers.

      If the NeoR gene cannot be detected after the first cell infusion, the entire procedure
      (donor apheresis, gene marking and infusion of cells) will be repeated twice-about once every
      6 weeks. If the first infusion was uncomplicated, the second and third infusions may be done
      on an outpatient basis, with monitoring for 6 hours rather than 24. Six weeks after the third
      infusion, tests will be scheduled monthly for 6 months and then yearly for long-term
      follow-up.

      In addition to the above procedures, patients with a baseline CD4 lymphocyte count less than
      100 cells per cubic millimeter of blood will be asked to undergo apheresis periodically to
      obtain the most accurate results for determining how long the NeoR gene persists in the
      blood. The procedure will be done weekly for the first 6 weeks after each infusion of cells,
      then at week 8, and then every 4 weeks until the gene can no longer be detected in the
      lymphocytes. The schedule may change, but will not require more frequent apheresis.

      This phase I/II pilot project will evaluate the survival, tolerance, safety, and efficacy of
      infusions of activated, gene marked, syngeneic T lymphocytes obtained from HIV seronegative
      identical twins on the functional immune status of HIV infected twin recipients. T cells from
      each seronegative twin will be obtained by periodic apheresis, induced to polyclonal
      proliferation with anti-CD3 and rIL-2 stimulation, transduced with distinctive neoR
      retroviral vectors, and expanded 10-1,000 fold in numbers during approximately 2 weeks of
      culture. These marked T cells will then be infused into the seropositive twins and the
      survival of the uniquely marked T cell populations will be monitored by vector-specific PCR,
      while the recipients' functional immune status is monitored by standard in vitro and in vivo
      testing protocols. A total of 3 cycles of treatment may be given at intervals of 6 weeks
      between infusions.

        by standard ELISA and Western blot testing.

        Patients with Kaposi's sarcoma are eligible for this study, but must not have received any
        systemic therapy for KS within 4 weeks prior to entry. The diagnosis of KS must have been
        confirmed by biopsy.

        cells/mm3 are eligible to receive cell therapy on this protocol, but must be treated with
        antiretroviral therapy if evidence of significant and persistent viral activation occurs in
