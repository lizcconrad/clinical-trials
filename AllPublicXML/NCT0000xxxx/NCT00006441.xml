  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether taking interleukin-2 (IL-2) and other anti-HIV
      drugs affects the course of HIV disease in patients with primary HIV infection (the time
      period that immediately follows infection with HIV).

      After primary HIV infection, the actual infection is spread through an increasing amount of
      HIV virus in the body. Studies have shown that, by taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs, it
      is possible to reduce the amount of HIV in the body to almost undetectable levels. This study
      will find out if starting anti-HIV drugs during primary infection will interrupt or reduce
      the spread of HIV in patients' bodies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following initial exposure to HIV, infection is established through the rapid replication of
      a homogeneous strain of the virus. Preliminary studies of combination antiretroviral therapy
      show that it is possible to reduce circulating HIV RNA to below detectable levels at this
      phase. Sustained suppression of viral replication or viral eradication may be possible only
      before HIV has become integrated in the immune system and undergone a number of quasi species
      mutations. This study will assess the feasibility of interrupting the natural course of HIV
      infection by using antiretroviral therapy soon after initial infection.

      Nelfinavir (NFV) and zidovudine/lamivudine (Combivir) treatment starts as soon as possible
      and at most, 7 days from the diagnosis of HIV infection, and continues for 104 weeks. After 4
      weeks of therapy patients are randomized to begin receiving IL-2 therapy or to delay starting
      it until Week 48. Patients may choose not to receive IL-2 treatment and remain in the study.
      Patients have clinic visits to measure viral load every 4 weeks. At a final clinic visit,
      physical examinations and collection of semen, cervical fluid, blood, and saliva specimens
      are done. Eligible consenting patients have a tonsil biopsy. Patients are reimbursed for
      participation in this study.
