      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who
      have metastatic bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, and overall survival of
      patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with oxaliplatin. II. Determine the
      toxicity, including objective measurement of neurotoxicity, of oxaliplatin in these patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by platinum therapy status
      (platinum sensitive vs platinum resistant). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression, other illness that
      would preclude administration of study drug, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      for a minimum of 2 years or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
