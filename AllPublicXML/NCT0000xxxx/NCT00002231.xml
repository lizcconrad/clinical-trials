  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give GENEVAX-HIV, a new HIV vaccine, to
      HIV-negative volunteers. This study will also look at how this vaccine affects the immune
      system of these volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label study, volunteers are given an intramuscular injection of GENEVAX-HIV
      vaccine using the Biojector 2000. Safety measures and immune response are assessed
      accordingly.
