        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Antiviral therapy (e.g., zidovudine).

          -  Prophylaxis (including aerosolized pentamidine) for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
             (PCP).

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Radiation therapy for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.

        Patients must be oriented to person, place, and time and able to give written informed
        consent.

          -  Patients must have had an acute episode of cryptococcal meningitis that was documented
             by recovery and identification of cryptococcus from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
             culture within 4 months of study entry.

          -  Adequate therapy will consist of 6 - 16 weeks of treatment with amphotericin B alone,
             amphotericin B + oral flucytosine, or a period of the combination followed by
             amphotericin alone. Adequate regimens will include:

          -  A minimum total amphotericin B dose of 2 grams as monotherapy.

          -  6 weeks of flucytosine at 150 mg/kg/day (or levels of 20 to 100 mcg/ml demonstrated)
             plus amphotericin B at an average daily dose of at least 0.3 mg/kg/day or to a total
             dose of 1 gram.

          -  After a shorter period of the combination amphotericin/flucytosine therapy, an
             additional Y grams of amphotericin B monotherapy will make therapy adequate where Y =
             2 gm-(X weeks combination therapy / 3 weeks).

          -  For example, a patient who received 3 weeks of combination followed by amphotericin
             alone would need an additional 2 gm - 3 weeks/3 weeks = 1 gm of amphotericin B.

          -  Patients need not be receiving amphotericin B at the time of randomization but must
             begin study maintenance therapy within 3 weeks of cessation of primary amphotericin B
             therapy.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Antiviral therapy (e.g., zidovudine (AZT)).

          -  Prophylaxis (including aerosolized pentamidine) for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
             (PCP).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Clinical evidence of acute or chronic meningitis based upon any etiology other than
             cryptococcosis.

          -  History of allergy or intolerance of imidazoles, azoles, or amphotericin B.

          -  Moderate or severe liver disease.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Intrathecal amphotericin B.

          -  Coumarin-type anticoagulants.

          -  Oral hypoglycemics.

          -  Barbiturates.

          -  Phenytoin.

          -  Immunostimulants.

          -  Investigational drugs or approved (licensed) drugs for investigational indications.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Lymphocyte replacement.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Clinical evidence of acute or chronic meningitis based upon any etiology other than
             cryptococcosis.

          -  History of allergy or intolerance of imidazoles, azoles, or amphotericin B.

          -  Moderate or severe liver disease defined by specific lab values.

          -  Inability to take oral medications reliably.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Coumarin-type anticoagulants.

          -  Oral hypoglycemics.

          -  Barbiturates.
