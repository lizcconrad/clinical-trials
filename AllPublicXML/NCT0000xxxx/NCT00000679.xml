  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To show that zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) is at least as effective as zidovudine (AZT)
      in the treatment of AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC), and also that ddC shows a
      different safety profile than AZT.

      In clinical studies, ddC shows antiviral activity. Because of the antiviral activity, and
      because of the low incidence of mild, reversible neurotoxicity and absence of blood-related
      toxicity with low dose ddC therapy, a long-term Phase II/III study comparing ddC to AZT in
      patients with AIDS or advanced ARC is now warranted.

      In clinical studies, ddC shows antiviral activity. Because of the antiviral activity, and
      because of the low incidence of mild, reversible neurotoxicity and absence of blood-related
      toxicity with low dose ddC therapy, a long-term Phase II/III study comparing ddC to AZT in
      patients with AIDS or advanced ARC is now warranted.

      After screening, physical examination and laboratory tests (within 14 days of entry) patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment groups. They receive either ddC plus an AZT placebo or
      AZT plus a ddC placebo. Because it is a blinded study, patients do not know which group they
      are in. Patients are evaluated weekly for the first 10 weeks and then biweekly thereafter.

          -  Allowed with interruption of study medication for up to 21 days per episode and for a
             total of 42 days for the study:

          -  Drugs that could cause serious additive toxicity when coadministered with either study
             medication for treatment of an acute intercurrent illness or opportunistic infection,
             including:

          -  Acyclovir (&lt; 600 mg/day), fluconazole, systemic pentamidine, foscarnet, pyrimethamine,
             triple sulfa, ansamycin, ganciclovir, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole.

        Patients must have a diagnosis of AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC). At least 20
        percent of the patients must have a consistently positive serum HIV p24 antigen (= or &gt; 70
        pg/ml) as defined by the Abbott HIV antigen test, on two separate occasions at least 72
        hours apart.

          -  Patients found at screening to have a temperature &gt; 38.5 degrees C should be evaluated
             for the possibility of an occult opportunistic or bacterial infection or neoplasm. If
             this complete evaluation reveals an infection, they can be entered. If this evaluation
             is unrevealing, they may be entered after evaluation is completed but while

             temperatures &gt; 38.5 degrees C should be evaluated as above and/or be afebrile
