      To determine the effects in early adulthood of asthma, increased bronchial responsiveness,
      markers of allergy and smoking on pulmonary function level and the effects of these same risk
      factors on subsequent decline in pulmonary function, because these early adult factors
      presumably profoundly influence the risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The questions studied included whether the above named risk factors reduced the maximally
      attained level of pulmonary function in early adulthood, foreshortened the postulated
      stability of level of pulmonary function between age 18 and 35 and/or unfavorably affected
      subsequent decline in level of pulmonary function. FEV1/h2, VC/h2 and FEV1/IVC were studied,
      using graphic smooth techniques and regression analyses techniques on both cross-sectional
      and longitudinal datasets. In addition, the investigators tested the hypothesis stating that
      early adult symptoms of asthma, increased bronchial responsiveness, markers of allergy
      influenced who became a smoker, influenced the amount smoked and/or influenced who stopped
      smoking relatively early in adult life, using logistic regression analyses and survival
      analyses.
