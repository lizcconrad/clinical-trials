      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer
      cells. Histamine dihydrochloride may prolong survival and improve quality of life in patients
      with metastatic kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with or
      without histamine dihydrochloride in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) histamine
           dihydrochloride given in conjunction with SC recombinant human interleukin-2 in patients
           with stage IV renal cell carcinoma in terms of survival at 1 year, objective tumor
           response rate, duration of response, and median survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) with or without histamine dihydrochloride.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and histamine
           dihydrochloride SC twice daily on days 1-5 of weeks 1-3 followed by 2 weeks of rest.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2
           courses in both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
