  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years researchers have been trying to better understand the regulation of sleep and
      activity by studying circadian (daily) rhythms of human beings. It appears that the hormones
      estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythm in
      animals. Researchers believe these hormones may also play a similar role in the regulation of
      human circadian rhythms. Little research has been conducted on how these hormones affect
      human circadian rhythms.

      This study is designed to learn more about how specific hormones influence men and women's
      daily rhythms. This study will use women from another research study being conducted at the
      NIMH called, &quot;The central nervous system effects of pharmacologically induced
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without estrogen and progesterone&quot;. Male subjects will
      be recruited from another NIMH study called, &quot;The central nervous system effects of
      pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without testosterone
      replacement&quot;.

      In order to test the possibility that gonadal steroids (estrogen, progesterone, and
      testosterone) change circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle in humans, participants will
      undergo chronobiologic evaluations. The chronobiologic evaluations will look at sleep and
      rest periods, activity as measured by a wrist monitor, and 24 hour inpatient
      electroencephalograph (EEG), rectal temperature, and melatonin monitoring.

      It is hypothesized that gonadal steroids modulate circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle
      in humans, as they do in animals. This hypothesis will be tested by performing chronobiologic
      evaluations on women enrolled in protocol 92-M-0174 (&quot;The central nervous system effects of
      pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without estrogen and
      progesterone&quot;) and on men enrolled in protocol 94-M-0037 (The central nervous system effects
      of pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without testosterone
      replacement&quot;). Based on the animal literature, we hypothesize that melatonin and sleep onset
      will be phase-advanced in women on estrogen, compared with those on progesterone or in a
      hypogonadal state. We also hypothesize that the amplitude of the activity cycle will be
      decreased in the progesterone, as compared with the estrogen, condition. Based on findings in
      amenorrheic women and in those on oral contraceptives, we hypothesize that the amplitude of
      melatonin secretion will be increased in the hypogonadal state, compared with the other two
      conditions. Finally, based on literature cited below, we hypothesize that mean prolactin
      levels will be higher in the testosterone plus Lupron condition and in the estrogen plus
      Lupron condition than in the other hormonal conditions.
