      RATIONALE: Laparoscopic-assisted surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for colorectal
      cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. It is not yet known if
      undergoing conventional surgery is more effective than laparoscopic-assisted surgery for
      colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying conventional surgery to see how well it
      works compared to laparoscopic-assisted surgery in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether longitudinal and circumferential resection margins and lymphatic
           clearances obtained during laparoscopic surgery are different from those obtained with
           conventional open surgery in patients with colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the patterns of loco-regional or distant metastatic spread after these two
           surgical methods in these patients.

        -  Compare the morbidity and mortality rates in these patients after these two surgical
           methods, particularly in terms of the technical or thromboembolic complications that may
           develop as a consequence of prolonged pneumoperitoneum.

        -  Compare the disease-free or overall survival of these patients after these two operative
           procedures.

        -  Determine, in those patients in whom laparoscopic surgery fails, which investigatory
           modalities are appropriate for providing pre-operative indications that a patient is an
           inappropriate candidate for laparoscopic dissection.

        -  Compare the differences in quality of life between the two operative procedures,
           particularly in patients with advanced disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo laparoscopic surgery or conventional open surgery.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months following surgery, then every 3 months for the first
      year, every 4 months for the second year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,200 patients will be accrued for this study within 5
      years.
