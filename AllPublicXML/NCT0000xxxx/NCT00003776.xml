      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug or combining chemotherapy with surgery
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and surgery in
      treating patients who have newly diagnosed metastatic osteosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of oral trimetrexate glucuronate with simultaneous
      leucovorin calcium protection in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic osteogenic sarcoma.
      II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen when administered prior to and following standard
      chemotherapy in patients with osteogenic sarcoma. III. Correlate response with in vitro
      determinants of chemotherapy resistance in tumor samples obtained from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction therapy of oral trimetrexate glucuronate (TMTX) and
      leucovorin calcium every 12 hours for 21 days (weeks 0-2). Patients receive leucovorin
      calcium for 3 additional days after the last dose of TMTX. If age prevents compliance with
      oral administration, patients receive TMTX IV and leucovorin calcium IV. Patients undergo
      definitive surgery 7-10 days after the induction therapy (week 4). Patients undergo surgery
      for metastatic disease, if indicated, as soon as possible following recovery from definitive
      surgery. Patients then receive maintenance therapy every 3 weeks for 8-9 months according to
      the following schedule: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour 4 times daily on days 1-4
      plus doxorubicin IV over 48 hours on days 1-2 in weeks 6, 14, and 22, and ifosfamide alone in
      week 30. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 4 hours for 1 day, plus doxorubicin IV over 48
      hours for 2 days beginning on the same day as the first dose of cisplatin, in weeks 10, 18,
      and 26. Patients receive cisplatin alone in week 34. Patients receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously daily for 2 weeks starting 24 hours after the completion of each course of
      ifosfamide and cisplatin therapy. Patients receive methotrexate IV over 4 hours for 1 day,
      plus oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hours for at least 10 doses beginning 20 hours after the
      last dose of methotrexate, in weeks 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, and 37. In severe cases,
      patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours. Patients who respond to induction
      therapy receive a second course of the same therapy in weeks 38-40. Patients are followed
      every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3 years.
