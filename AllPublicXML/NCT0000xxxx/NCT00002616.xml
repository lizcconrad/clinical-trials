      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Peripheral stem cell transplantation combined with biological
      therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with filgrastim to
      stimulate cell production in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, metastatic, or
      recurrent breast cancer who will undergo peripheral stem cell transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of continuous infusion interleukin-2
      (IL-2) that can be combined with a standard dose of filgrastim (G-CSF) to stimulate
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for harvest in patients with advanced breast cancer. II.
      Assess PBSC engraftment following high dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (the
      STAMP V regimen) supported by G-CSF or IL-2/G-CSF hematopoietic support in patients who
      underwent the same pretransplant PBSC stimulation. III. Characterize the toxic effects of
      combined IL-2 and G-CSF. IV. Compare immune function changes following IL-2/G-CSF and G-CSF
      alone by assessing expression of CD56/CD56-bright, CD3, and CD25; natural killer cell and
      lymphokine activated killer cell activity; T-cell responses (TT, HER2/neu); and serum levels
      of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and G-CSF. V. Compare the effects on the expression
      of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+, CFU-GM, and BFU-GM) of a range of IL-2
      doses when combined with G-CSF to those achieved with G-CSF alone. VI. Compare the time to
      neutrophil and platelet recovery, requirements for red blood cell and platelet transfusion,
      and time to hospital discharge in patients receiving IL-2/G-CSF-primed vs. G-CSF-primed PBSC
      following STAMP V chemotherapy. VII. Compare the feasibility, toxicity, and hematologic and
      immunologic effects of post-PBSC infusion of IL-2/G-CSF vs. G-CSF alone. VIII. Assess the
      response rate, duration of response, and disease free interval of patients with advanced
      breast cancer treated with STAMP V with PBSC rescue. IX. Assess the presence of cytokeratin
      as a marker of minimum residual disease when measured in blood and marrow by polymerase chain
      reaction during and following treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for peripheral blood stem cell
      stimulation (priming) and for therapy after stem cell transplantation. All patients receive
      priming therapy with filgrastim (G-CSF) alone or with interleukin-2 (IL-2), then have stem
      cells harvested. Patients with adequate harvest receive high dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa,
      and carboplatin (STAMP V) followed by stem cell rescue with subsequent G-CSF with or without
      IL-2, as follows: Arm I receives G-CSF alone for priming and following stem cell transplant.
      Arm II receives G-CSF priming alone and G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant. Arm III receives
      various doses of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and G-CSF following transplant. Arm IV receives various
      levels of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and fixed doses of G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant. Cohorts of
      3-6 patients each are treated on each treatment arm and at escalating doses of IL-2. The
      maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24
      months; a maximum of 12 patients will receive G-CSF priming alone (6 without and 6 with
      post-PBSC IL-2).
