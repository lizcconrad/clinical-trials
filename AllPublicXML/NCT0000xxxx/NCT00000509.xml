      To examine the role of dietary sodium reduction with and without potassium supplementation in
      controlling blood pressure in hypertensive men.

      BACKGROUND:

      Appropriately increased interest and concern about high blood pressure as a major public
      health problem coincided with the indication that the risks of hypertension-related morbidity
      and mortality could be reduced by reduction of blood pressure. Consensus suggestions that
      individualized approaches be used in treating patients with mild hypertension stimulated
      further investigations of non-pharmacological methods. Such investigations were also of
      considerable interest in relation to understanding the physiology of blood pressure control
      as well as the development of less costly non-drug therapies. Interest was heightened by
      information suggesting that there might be distinctly harmful side effects related to
      antihypertensive drug therapy, particularly thiazide diuretics, in some settings. Studies of
      non-drug therapies included dietary modifications primarily involving weight reduction and
      sodium restriction with increasing recent concern about other factors such as alcohol intake,
      dietary fat, calcium, magnesium, and potassium intake.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind. One hundred forty-five subjects were randomized into a low sodium
      placebo group in which sodium intake was restricted to no more than 80 mEq/day, 142 subjects
      into a potassium supplementation (96 mEq/day) group whose sodium intake was also restricted
      to no more than 80 mEq/day. After 12 weeks of intervention, antihypertensive drugs were
      withdrawn. Follow-up of each participant was for at least two years. The primary endpoint was
      the proportion of subjects requiring antihypertensive medication at various points following
      randomization.
