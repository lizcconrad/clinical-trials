  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect information on the effectiveness and toxicity of clindamycin plus pyrimethamine
      and leucovorin calcium for the treatment of acute toxoplasmic encephalitis in adult patients
      with AIDS. Toxoplasmic encephalitis (encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii) is the most
      frequent cause of focal central nervous system infection in patients with AIDS. If untreated,
      the encephalitis is fatal. At present, it is standard practice to give a combination of
      pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis. The high frequency of
      sulfonamide-induced toxicity in AIDS patients often makes completion of a full course of
      therapy difficult. There is some information that high doses of parenteral (such as by
      injection) clindamycin used with pyrimethamine may be as effective as pyrimethamine plus
      sulfadiazine in the management of the acute phase of toxoplasmic encephalitis in patients
      with AIDS. Administration of parenteral clindamycin for prolonged periods of time, however,
      is costly, requires hospitalization, and is inconvenient for the patient. There is some
      indication that treatment of AIDS patients with acute toxoplasmic encephalitis with oral
      clindamycin may be effective. Leucovorin calcium is useful in preventing
      pyrimethamine-associated bone marrow toxicity.

      Amended: Projected accrual increased to 50 patients. Original design: Patients receive study
      medications for a total of 6 weeks unless there are intervening events that require the
      discontinuation of study therapy. Patients are initially treated in the hospital (minimum of
      7 days). Patients who are considered responders at day 7 may complete therapy on an
      outpatient basis. Nonresponders at day 7 may also be managed on an outpatient basis when it
      is medically appropriate.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Erythropoietin.

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

          -  Immunoglobulin therapy.

          -  Alpha interferon.

          -  Patients entering study on isoniazid (INH) may continue INH therapy.

          -  Use of corticosteroids is discouraged. If corticosteroids are needed for the
             management of intracranial hypertension or cranial mass effect, use of dexamethasone
             is encouraged (4 g orally 4 times daily for 3 days and thereafter tapered over the
             next 10 to 14 days).

        Patients are admitted into the study if they have:

          -  Laboratory evidence of HIV infection or if they have an undetermined HIV infection
             status if they belong to a high-risk group for HIV infection.

          -  Either a definite or presumptive diagnosis of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Patient or
             appropriate family member, or legal designee must be able to understand and sign a
             written informed consent.
