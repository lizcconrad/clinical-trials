    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus topotecan in treating patients
      who have solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of
      topotecan and paclitaxel in patients with solid tumors.

      II. Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan and paclitaxel.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 followed 2-6 hours later by topotecan IV
      continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan and paclitaxel until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each drug is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-12
      months.
