  <brief_title>The Effectiveness of Ritonavir Plus Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Immunologic Consequences of a Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen (HAART) Consisting of Ritonavir (ABT-538), Zidovudine (AZT), and Lamivudine (3TC) in Moderately Advanced HIV-1 Disease</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether administration of a highly active antiretroviral treatment regimen
      consisting of ritonavir (ABT-538), zidovudine (AZT), and lamivudine (3TC) is associated with
      the restoration of delayed type hypersensitivity and lymphocyte proliferative responses in
      patients with moderately advanced HIV-1 infection. To better characterize in these patients
      the phenotype of the expanded lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as the genotype, phenotype,
      and cellular origin of viruses that persist after initiation of therapy, and the genotype and
      phenotype of drug-resistant isolates that emerge during therapy.

      Although plasma viral load drops dramatically after initiation of powerful antiretrovirals,
      it does not drop to zero. It appears that a new steady state is reached, suggesting that a
      reservoir may exist of virus-producing cells, possibly cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage,
      that continue to produce a low level of virus despite antiretroviral treatment.

      reservoir may exist of virus-producing cells, possibly cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage,
      that continue to produce a low level of virus despite antiretroviral treatment.

      Patients undergo 5 weeks of antiretroviral washout before initiating therapy with ritonavir
      alone for 9 days, followed by combination therapy with ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine
      from day 10 through week 48. [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/31/97: The availability of the current,
      open-label study treatment has been extended to allow patients who have completed 48 weeks of
      therapy to continue protocol therapy until the last enrolled patient completes 48 weeks of
      study treatment.]
