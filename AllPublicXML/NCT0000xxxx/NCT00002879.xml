      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effects of cladribine in previously treated or untreated
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CdA) as
      treatment for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) either as initial therapy or for relapsed/refractory
      disease. II. Determine by flow cytometry immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes the number of
      patients with peripheral blood involvement at the time of diagnosis and compare the presence
      or absence of peripheral blood involvement with response data. III. Detect rearrangements
      involving the bcl-1 gene and immunoglobulin heavy chain locus by molecular techniques (e.g.,
      polymerase chain reaction, Southern blotting, or in situ hybridization), and compare these
      results with immunohistochemical demonstration of bcl-1 protein expression. VI. Determine the
      proliferative rate of MCL by immunohistochemistry and DNA content flow cytometry. V.
      Summarize the toxic effects associated with this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CdA) daily for 5 days every 4
      weeks for a maximum of 6 courses; response is assessed after every 2 courses. Patients in
      complete remission or with stable disease discontinue treatment and are followed; those with
      disease progression at any time are removed from study. Patients are followed every 2 months
      for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and annually for 2 years.
