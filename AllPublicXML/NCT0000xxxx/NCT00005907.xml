    <textblock>
      This study will compare the immune system response to booster vaccines for tetanus/diphtheria
      and hepatitis B in healthy volunteers with that of patients who have had a blood transplant.
      (A blood transplant is an infusion of donated stem cells-i.e., cells that mature into white
      blood cells, red blood cells and platelets). The study will also look at how age of the blood
      cell donor and recipient, the type of blood transplant, the amount of certain types of white
      cells in donor blood, and other variables may influence the vaccine response among the
      transplant patients.

      This study includes normal volunteers and patients who have had a blood transplant. Healthy
      volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60 who have previously been vaccinated with the
      hepatitis B or tetanus/diphtheria vaccine and have not had hepatitis B may be eligible for
      this study. Patients enrolled in a blood cell transplant study at NIH who are between 5 and
      60 years old, have been vaccinated against tetanus/diphtheria, and have not had hepatitis B
      may be eligible. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and blood tests.

      Those enrolled in the study will have about 2 tablespoons of blood drawn before vaccination
      with a standard tetanus/diphtheria booster shot. Volunteers who have previously been
      vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine and all blood transplant patients will also receive a
      hepatitis B vaccination. Participants will have blood drawn (from 1 to 5 tablespoons) up to
      once a week after vaccination for no more than 8 weeks to evaluate the immune response to
      vaccination.

      This study will compare booster vaccine responses in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HSCT) to a group of healthy volunteers. Responses among different types of
      HSCT will be compared to each other as well. Serum antibody titers to vaccine antigens and
      quantification of antigen specific lymphocytes will be followed. Approximately 15 healthy
      subjects and 40 patients will be enrolled.

        Not receiving any more than replacement glucocorticoid therapy.

        Not receiving any dose of cyclosporine.

        No acute graft-versus-host disease grade II or higher, at time of consideration for study.

        No chronic graft-versus-host disease more involved than localized skin lesions and/or liver
        dysfunction, at time of consideration for study.
