      RATIONALE: A vaccine made from a person's myelodysplasia cells may make the body build an
      immune response to kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may kill
      more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim in
      treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome treated with mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the
      specific N-, K-, or H-ras peptide mutation in their bone marrow) and intradermal sargramostim
      (GM-CSF). II. Determine whether HLA type or the ability to respond immunologically to common
      recall antigens correlates with the induction of anti-ras immune responses in these patients
      treated with this regimen. III. Assess toxicity of mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally on days 1-10. Patients receive
      mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific N-, K-, or H-ras mutation in
      their bone marrow) intradermally on day 7. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 5
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      at 2 and 6 weeks after the last vaccination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-70 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-15
      months.
