  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate three doses of clarithromycin in children with AIDS and Mycobacterium avium
      complex (MAC) infection who are receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy.

      Before more extensive evaluation of this promising drug for treatment of MAC infection in
      children can be done, it is important to study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this
      population, to get information regarding its use in pediatric patients receiving currently
      available antiretroviral drugs, and to get information on the antimycobacterial activity of
      this drug.

      Patients that are included are HIV infected and have started zidovudine (AZT) or didanosine
      (ddI) at least 4 weeks before entry into this study. Patients continue taking the medications
      at prescribed doses. In addition they also take clarithromycin. Patients continue treatment
      with AZT or ddI plus clarithromycin for 12 weeks.

             weeks prior to study entry.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS and Mycobacterium avium complex.

          -  Ability to tolerate therapy with zidovudine or didanosine at specified dosages.

          -  Written consent from a parent or legal guardian.

          -  Willing to comply with all procedures and scheduled visits. Relatively stable clinical
             condition.

          -  History of allergy to macrolide antibiotics.

          -  Presence of acute bacterial infection or acute onset of opportunistic infection as
             listed in protocol.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Presence of current opportunistic infection other than Mycobacterium avium complex
             defined as systemic candidemia, cryptosporidiosis, isosporiasis, toxoplasmosis,
