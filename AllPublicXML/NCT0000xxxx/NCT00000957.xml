  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and immune response to vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope
      glycoprotein (gp160) using an accelerated dosage schedule; to evaluate duration of antibody
      response and its relationship to the dose and frequency of inoculation.

      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently
      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently
      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Thirty healthy adult volunteers without identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV-1 are
      randomly assigned to receive vaccination with gp160 (50 mcg) according to one of the
      following schedules: Group 1 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, and 140 and placebo on days
      84 and 112; Group 2 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 and placebo on day 140.
      Subjects are followed for 1 year after the last injection. Per 05/13/94 amendment, 10
      subjects at the St. Louis University site receive an additional boost 18-24 months after the
      last injection.
