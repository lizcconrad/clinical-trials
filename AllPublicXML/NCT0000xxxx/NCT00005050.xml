      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining eniluracil, fluorouracil,
      and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer that has been
      treated previously.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and recommended
      phase II dose of eniluracil, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in patients with previously
      treated advanced colorectal cancer. II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of eniluracil and fluorouracil. Patients receive
      oral eniluracil and oral fluorouracil twice daily on days 1-21. Patients receive oxaliplatin
      IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response are treated with 2 more
      courses and then therapy is stopped. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      eniluracil and fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as 1 dose level below the
      MTD. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study, and an
      additional 27-40 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study.
