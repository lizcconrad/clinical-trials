  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) can cause poor blood flow and supply to the heart muscle. It
      can result in irreversible damage to the heart muscle and poor function. Before treating
      patients with heart disease it is important to know how well the heart is functioning.
      Echocardiography is a diagnostic test that can measure heart function. If part of the heart
      muscle is not working properly due to previous damage, echocardiography can provide
      information about how much improvement can be expected after treatment (surgery or
      angioplasty).

      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of myocardial contrast echocardiography
      (MCE) to dobutamine echocardiography to detect the potential for damaged heart muscle to be
      treated and function in patients with heart disease.

      Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) does not use radioactivity. It uses sound waves
      like standard echocardiography. However, with MCE patients receive an injection of a
      &quot;contrast agent&quot; directly into the blood stream through a vein. The contrast agent, called
      Optison, is made of tiny microbubbles smaller than red blood cells. The echocardiogram can
      detect these microbubbles in the small blood vessels of the heart muscle and allow
      researchers to find areas of the heart receiving less blood flow than others.

      Echocardiography with Dobutamine does not use radioactivity. It uses sound waves, like
      standard echocardiography. During this echocardiogram patients receive doses of a medication
      called dobutamine that stimulates the heart to beat stronger and faster. Heart muscle that
      does not beat stronger after dobutamine is probably dead, usually as a result of a previous
      heart attack.

      Dobutamine echocardiography has become a valuable technique for the evaluation of myocardial
      viability in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and dysfunctional myocardium because
      it can accurately predict which myocardial segments will show contractile recovery after
      successful revascularization. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) offers the potential
      to evaluate tissue perfusion at the level where oxygen transfer to the myocytes occurs. MCE,
      therefore, can provide information regarding the functional status of the myocardial
      microvasculature which has a close relationship with myocellular integrity. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MCE compared to dobutamine echocardiography to
      detect myocardial viability in patients with CAD and resting wall motion abnormalities.

        Patients undergoing evaluation for CAD who show at least two myocardial segments with wall
        motion abnormalities on a baseline echocardiogram will be offered to participate in this
        study.

        Patients will be adults older than 21 years of age.

        No pre-menopausal patients who are lactating, are pregnant or potentially pregnant as
        judged by history, physical examination, ultrasound or urine pregnancy test.

        No one with unstable angina.

        No subjects with recent myocardial infarction (less than 1 month).

        No one with frequent ectopy which precludes adequate imaging acquisition.

        No subjects with significant hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 170 mm Hg).

        No hypotension with basal sitting systolic arterial pressure less than 100 mm HG confirmed
        30 minutes later.

        No subjects with sinus tachycardia greater than or equal to 100 beats/minute.

        No atrial fibrillation.

        No inadequate two-dimensional echocardiographic windows.
