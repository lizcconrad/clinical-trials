      To study the safety and toxicity of intranasal peptide T (D-Ala-1-peptide-T-amide) in humans,
      and to find out how quickly and how much of a given dose enters the bloodstream and how
      quickly it leaves the bloodstream. To obtain information on the ability of intranasal peptide
      T to prevent, halt, and/or reverse the effects of AIDS on the central nervous system.

      Studies have shown that AIDS is caused by a retrovirus. This virus works by inactivating or
      destroying human CD4 cells (which are part of the human immune system). This in turn leads to
      the observed immunologic defects and related illnesses, including HIV encephalopathy (disease
      of the brain). One method of preventing AIDS is to prevent HIV from entering the cell. HIV
      binds to the receptor CD4 site. Peptide T also binds to this site, and thus by competing for
      that site, can block the binding of the virus to its receptor. Preliminary animal and human
      studies indicate that peptide T is safe at the doses selected for this trial.

      Thirty patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) are entered into the study to receive
      an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of intranasal peptide T for 12 - 16 weeks
      followed by a 1-month off-drug follow-up period and a subsequent 1-month return to the drug.
      All patients receive an initial intravenous test dose of peptide T. The test dose is
      administered over 1 hour, followed by an observation period of 8 hours in the outpatient
      clinic.
