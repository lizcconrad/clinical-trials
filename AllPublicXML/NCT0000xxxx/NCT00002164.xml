      To evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetic profile of Viracept pediatric powder formulation
      administered to HIV infected or exposed children and infants (0 to 13 years of age). An
      evaluation of the relative bioavailability of the pediatric powder formulation vs. a standard
      tablet formulation in older children (7 to 13 years of age) will also be conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a Viracept pediatric
      powder formulation with milk or formula. First a single dose will be administered. After the
      patient population is divided into 4 groups by age, an optimal dose will be determined for
      each group. This optimal dose will be given 3 times a day for a 6 week primary observation
      period, plus an optional 6 month extension.

      NOTE: During the single dose portion of this study, patients may be untreated or may continue
      treatment with their current nucleoside antiretroviral therapy. During multiple dose
      administration of Viracept, antiretroviral therapy will be intensified by either adding or
      modifying therapy. Antiretroviral therapies will be limited to those currently licensed
      including zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine or zalcitabine.
