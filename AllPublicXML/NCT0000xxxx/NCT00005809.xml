      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic colonography may provide a
      less invasive method of identifying patients who have colorectal neoplasia.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to compare the effectiveness of computerized tomographic
      colonography with that of standard diagnostic procedures in detecting colorectal neoplasia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare retrospectively the accuracy of computerized tomographic colonography
      (CTC) vs pathology and colonoscopy in the detection of clinically important colorectal
      neoplasia, defined as at least one proven lesion with a diameter measuring at least 1 cm. II.
      Compare the physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing
      platforms for CTC images.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Radiologists evaluate each patient's
      optimal diagnostic computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) data. Patients' CTC findings
      are evaluated by a radiologist at a central facility using an imaging display software
      platform from General Electric, Vital Images, or the Mayo Clinic. CTC findings are compared
      with conventional colonoscopy findings and pathologic analysis. A comparison is made between
      physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing platforms
      for CTC images.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: The following case material must be submitted for each patient: No
        colonic diseases except polyps, cancer, or diverticulosis Optimal diagnostic computerized
        tomographic colonography (CTC) data with computed tomography acquisition parameters that
        meet the following minimal standards: Slice thickness no greater than 5 mm Reconstruction
        interval no greater than 3 mm Pitch no greater than 2 Anatomic coverage of the entire
        colorectum Supine and prone data sets Complete colonoscopy performed within 30 days
        following CTC by a board certified gastroenterologist or a physician with at least 3 years
        of colonoscopic experience Pathology reports for all endoscopically or surgically removed
        colorectal lesions with the exception of polyps that are inadvertently dropped at the time
        of retrieval Photograph or videotape record of dropped lesion allowed as proof of its
        existence All studies are allowed including those with lesions less than 1 cm, lesions at
        least 1 cm, or no lesions Report documents size, site, stage, grade, and type of colorectal
        cancers; size, site, degree of dysplasia, and type of colorectal adenomas; and types of
        other lesions (e.g., inflammatory, vascular, ulcerative) Demographic data including
        patient's age, sex, ethnic background, symptoms, risk factors, and relevant clinical
        history
