  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the response rate, response duration, clinical benefit, and toxicity of
      mitoguazone dihydrochloride (MGBG) in patients with AIDS-related refractory or relapsing
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive infusions of MGBG on days 1 and 8 and every 2 weeks thereafter. It is
      suggested that a lumbar puncture be performed to evaluate for leptomeningeal disease.
