  <brief_summary>

      To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of SDZ ILE 964 administered
      by daily subcutaneous injections in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      who have cytopenias (low blood cell counts). To obtain information about the biologic effects
      of SDZ ILE 964 administration in improving blood counts in HIV-infected patients. To obtain
      information about the effects of SDZ ILE-964 administration on both parameters of HIV
      replication and on residual immunologic function.
