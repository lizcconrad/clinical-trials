      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      One group receives copolymer 1, a mixture of synthetic polypeptides composed of 4 amino
      acids, subcutaneously each day for 2 years.

      The other group receives an injection of placebo daily for 2 years.
