      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and L-778,123 in
      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of L-778,123 when combined with
      paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. II. Evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Assess steady state plasma concentrations of various doses of L-778,123 combined with
      paclitaxel in these patients. IV. Evaluate radiologic or tumor marker responses to this
      regimen in these patients. V. Evaluate the relationship between ras mutations and response to
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of L-778,123. Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed within 24 hours by L-778,123 IV over 7 days. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete response receive 2 courses after documentation of response. Cohorts of 1-3
      patients receive escalating doses of L-778,123 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at about 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
