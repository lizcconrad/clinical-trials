      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more
      effective following surgery for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with or without epirubicin in
      treating women who have early stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effects of 4 courses of epirubicin followed by 4 courses of
      cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) versus 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant
      chemotherapy in women with node positive early breast cancer, as measured by overall and
      event free survival from the date or randomization. II. Compare the effects of 4 courses of
      epirubicin followed by 4 courses of CMF with 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant chemotherapy in
      these patients, as measured by acute and chronic toxicities. III. Compare the effects of 4
      courses of epirubicin followed by 4 courses of CMF versus 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant
      chemotherapy in these patients, as measured by quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized into 2 treatment
      arms within 4 weeks of surgery. Treatment begins within 6 weeks of surgery. One treatment arm
      receives 8 courses of cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) given intravenously
      (IV) every 3 weeks. The other arm receives 4 courses of epirubicin followed by 4 courses of
      CMF given IV every 3 weeks. Patients are followed annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued over 3 years.
