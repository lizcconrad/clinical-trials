  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a sporadic disorder which affects multiple sites in
      the skeleton. The bone at these sites is rapidly resorbed and replaced by abnormal fibrous
      tissue or mechanically abnormal bone. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune-Albright
      Syndrome (MAS), a syndrome originally defined by the triad of PFD, cafe-au-lait pigmentation
      of the skin, and precocious puberty. The bony lesions are frequently disfiguring and painful,
      and depending on the location of the lesion, can cause significant morbidity. Lesions in
      weight-bearing bones can lead to disabling fractures, while lesions in the skull can lead to
      compression of vital structures such as cranial nerves.

      The natural history of this disease is poorly described and there are no clearly-defined
      systemic therapies for the bone disease. The purpose of this study is to define the natural
      history of the disease with or without treatment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Any patient with a likelihood of having PFD or MAS, based on information from a
             referring physician or surgeon or provided by the patient or guardian, will be
             eligible for consideration for inclusion in the study. The diagnosis will be based on
             typical findings on bone biopsy, or on clinical grounds.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patient, child or parents unwilling to fully cooperate with the evaluation

          -  Patient or guardian of minor unable to provide informed consent.
