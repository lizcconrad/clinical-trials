      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give
      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Interferon alfa may interfere
      with the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of giving interferon alfa after
      chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation to patients who have stage III or stage
      IV multiple myeloma and who have been treated with high-dose melphalan.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b maintenance following high
      dose melphalan chemotherapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma. II. Determine the
      response rate to high dose dexamethasone therapy using sequential noncrossresistant
      chemotherapies for patients with advanced multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20, followed by 4
      weeks rest. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is administered intravenously in combination with mesna
      following dexamethasone therapy. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) is initiated subcutaneously 1 day
      later and is continued for 10 days to support stem cell collections, which begin 10-14 days
      after CTX induction. Following 4 weeks of rest, melphalan (L-PAM) is administered over 1
      hour. Stem cell rescue is begun 48 hours after L-PAM therapy. Three to 4 months after the
      first L-PAM course, a second L-PAM and stem cell rescue is undertaken. Interferon alfa-2b
      (IFN-A) maintenance is administered 3 times per week following bone marrow recovery from the
      first or second L-PAM courses. Patients achieving complete remission following the first
      course of L-PAM may proceed directly to IFN-A maintenance. Patients achieving greater than
      grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or not achieving an absolute neutrophil count of greater than
      1,000/mm3 by day 21 posttransplant are not eligible for dose escalation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled.
