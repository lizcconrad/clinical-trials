  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To determine the effect of 8 weeks of zidovudine (AZT) treatment on the HIV-1 burden
      in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue in HIV-1-infected, AZT-naive patients with CD4+ T
      lymphocyte counts between 100 and 500 cells/mm3.

      SECONDARY: To determine the extent to which apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in these
      patients.

      In previous trials of AZT treatment in HIV-infected patients, an antiviral effect has been
      clearly demonstrated by quantitative measurement of virus in plasma and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells. However, the lymphoid tissues appear to be a major reservoir for HIV-1 and
      a major site of virus replication in HIV-infected persons. Further data is needed to assess
      the effect of treatment on viral burden and HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue.

      Patients receive AZT daily for 8 weeks and are followed in clinic at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and
      14 (or possibly via telephone call at week 14). Patients undergo a lymph node biopsy at day 0
      and week 8.
