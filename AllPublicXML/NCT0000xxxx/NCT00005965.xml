      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin-1 plus cisplatin in treating
      patients who have recurrent or advanced cancer of the cervix.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of bryostatin-1 plus cisplatin in patients
      with recurrent or advanced carcinoma of the cervix. II. Determine the response rate,
      progression free interval, and duration of survival of these patients when treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin-1 IV over 1 hour and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3 years.
