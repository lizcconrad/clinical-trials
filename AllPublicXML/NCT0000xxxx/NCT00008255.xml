      RATIONALE: Doctors can diagnose lung cancer by collecting mucus coughed up from the lungs and
      examining it under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Breathing in INS316 may make it
      easier for patients to cough up mucus.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of INS316 in helping to
      diagnose lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether a cytological diagnosis of lung cancer can be obtained more
      frequently from sputum specimens following inhalation of INS316 compared to specimens
      obtained following placebo or compared to specimens spontaneously expectorated in patients
      with untreated lung cancer. II. Assess the relative sensitivity of sputum cytology in the
      diagnosis of lung malignancies in this patient population using these sputum collection
      regimens. III. Determine the quantity of macrophages in sputum of these patients using these
      techniques. IV. Determine if the number of macrophages in sputum obtained by these methods is
      predictive of the likelihood of obtaining a positive diagnosis of lung cancer in these
      patients. V. Determine the total amount of sputum expectorated from these patients using
      these techniques.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, multicenter
      study. Patients are randomized to one of two arms, then cross-over to the other arm. Arm I:
      Patients receive INS316 by inhalation via a nebulizer. Sputum is collected throughout the
      dosing and for 1 hour post dosing. Arm II: Patients receive placebo in the same manner as
      INS136 in arm I. All patients receive both treatments. Patients receive the first dose no
      more than 7 days after screening, and the second dose 3 to 10 days after the first dose.
      Patients are followed 1 day after completion of the second treatment. The sputum samples are
      fixed and examined cytologically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100-130 patients will be accrued for this study.
