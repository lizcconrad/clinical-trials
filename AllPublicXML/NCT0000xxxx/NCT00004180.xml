      RATIONALE: Rosiglitazone may help liposarcoma cells develop into normal fat cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rosiglitazone in treating patients who
      have liposarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical activity of rosiglitazone in patients with liposarcoma.

        -  Assess the impact of this regimen on markers of tumor proliferation and differentiation
           status in these patients using biologic and biochemical testing and correlative imaging.

        -  Determine the tolerance and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by histologic subtype (well differentiated vs
      dedifferentiated vs myxoid/round cell vs pleomorphic).

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1-3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-120 patients (14-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 15 months.

    <measure>Evidence of biological response</measure>
    <description>Evidence of biological response can be measured or defined by intracytoplasmic microvesicular lipid accumulation, consistent with adipocytic differentiation in liposarcoma cells. Biological response can also be measured by clinically stable disease for x&gt;3 months, as well as standard clinical trial criteria for &quot;objective clinical response.&quot; Complete response is defined by total resolution of all detectable disease lasting for at least four weeks. Partial remission is a decrease of over 50% in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, persisting for at least four weeks, without progression of any non-measurable sites, and without appearance of any new sites of disease.</description>
