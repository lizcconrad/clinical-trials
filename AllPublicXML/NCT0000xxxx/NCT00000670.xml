  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the interaction of probenecid with zidovudine (AZT). Because AZT is eliminated
      quickly from the body, it must be taken frequently. A previous study showed that probenecid
      slowed the elimination of AZT without side effects, but that study lasted only 5 days. This
      study is to see whether this effect continues for 1 month and whether the continuation of
      probenecid and AZT is free of side effects over 1 month.

      Because AZT is eliminated quickly from the body, it must be taken frequently. A previous
      study showed that probenecid slowed the elimination of AZT without side effects, but that
      study lasted only 5 days. This study is to see whether this effect continues for 1 month and
      whether the continuation of probenecid and AZT is free of side effects over 1 month.

      Patients are hospitalized overnight on three separate occasions. On the first admission, AZT
      is administered every 4 hours. On the second day, 15 blood samples are taken to determine how
      fast the AZT enters and is removed from the bloodstream (pharmacokinetics). On the second
      day, after all the blood specimens have been collected, patient starts taking probenecid by
      mouth every 8 hours, and is discharged from the research unit. The AZT dose is then taken
      every 8 hours. One week later and again 3 weeks after that, patient is readmitted overnight
      and the blood sampling to measure AZT levels is repeated. AMENDED: 8 additional patients will
      be enrolled using the same doses of AZT but a lower dose of probenecid.
