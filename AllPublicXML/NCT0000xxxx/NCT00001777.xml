  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia refers to a condition where there is a loss of intellectual function (cognition). It
      is usually a progressive condition that interferes with normal social and occupational
      activities.

      Patients with frontal lobe dementia (FLD) suffer from a destruction of the brain cells found
      in the frontal lobe of the brain. Loss of frontal lobe neurons can cause changes in
      personality, such as aggressiveness, agitation, and depression. In addition, patients with
      FLD may have difficulty planning tasks and may have a loss of motivation.

      Researchers believe that the cells lost in the frontal lobe of the brain are responsible for
      producing a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, which means it is
      used by neurons to communicate with other neurons. Researchers are inclined to believe that
      by replacing the missing serotonin, symptoms of FLD may be relieved.

      Drugs known as serotonin uptake inhibitors, help to maintain high levels of serotonin in the
      body. They have been used successfully to treat patients with depression and patients with
      violent / impulsive behaviors. Sertraline is a serotonin reuptake blocker that is relatively
      easy to give (once daily), is safer than most other serotonin reuptake blockers (very little
      effect on vital enzyme systems [cytochrome P-450]), and has few interactions with other
      drugs.

      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of Sertraline for the treatment of symptoms
      associated with FLD. Patients participating in the study will receive Sertraline for 6 weeks
      and a placebo &quot;inactive sugar pill&quot; for 6 weeks. During the study, researchers will test
      psychological and neurological functions to measure the effects of the drug.

      Degeneration of frontal serotonin-containing neurons occurs in frontal lobe dementia (FLD).
      The associated loss of serotonin transmission may contribute to the frontal lobe dysfunction
      associated with this disorder. FLD patients will undergo a controlled clinical trial of an
      orally administered serotonergic agent (Sertraline) which acts centrally to selectively block
      serotonin uptake to treat patients' cognitive and behavioral frontal dysfunction. Study
      subjects will be evaluated at regular intervals with a battery of neuropsychological and
      behavioral tests designed to assess frontal and other cognitive functions. In addition,
      compliance and levels of the medication will be measured in the blood and when possible in
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

        Characterized as having behavioral manifestations using a standardized neuropsychiatric
        scale and interview.

        FLD patients' frontal cognitive sysfunctions characterized using a short neurobehavioral
        test battery.

        Patients must be able to be tested and cooperative with the procedures required in this
        protocol.

        No contraindications to the use of Sertraline.

        No medical conditions that can reasonably be expected to subject the patient to unwarranted
        risk (e.g., cancer) or require frequent changes in medication. Well-controlled medical
        conditions such as hypertension and diabetes will not be excluded.

        Patients must not be pregnant or nursing and must be using effective contraception, if
        still at child-bearing age.

        No history of prior severe traumatic brain injury or other severe neurologic or psychiatric
        condition, such as psychosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury.

        Not using any psychotropic medication which cannot be stopped 4 weeks before the study.
