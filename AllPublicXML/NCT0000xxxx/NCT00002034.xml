  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of long-term ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy for newly
      diagnosed macular threatening Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. To evaluate
      the clinical response to a 52 week course of intravenous DHPG therapy. To evaluate the safety
      and tolerance of long-term DHPG with concurrent treatment with zidovudine (AZT). (Patients
      utilizing treatment with other anti-retroviral drugs will be considered for study entry on a
      case by case basis.) To determine survival in this group of patients with AIDS and CMV
      retinitis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Topical acyclovir.

          -  Selected cytokines.

          -  Allowed after the first 4 weeks of ganciclovir:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) at a reduced dose (500 mg/day) in patients who have tolerated
             ganciclovir without grade 3/4 hematological toxicity.

          -  Other anti-retrovirals after consultation with the Syntex study monitor.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  AIDS and newly diagnosed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

          -  An understanding of the nature of the study, agreement to its provisions, and
             willingness to sign the informed consent approved by the appropriate institutions
             review board, and Syntex.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Have only peripheral CMV retinitis (defined as a lesion outside the major temporal
             vascular arcades, greater than 1500 microns from the optic disk, or greater than 3000
             microns from the fovea).

          -  Ocular media opacities (corneal, lenticular, or vitreal) preventing ophthalmologic
             retinal assessment.

          -  Ocular conditions requiring immediate surgical correction (eg:

          -  retinal tear or detachment).

          -  Demonstrated hypersensitivity to acyclovir or ganciclovir.

          -  Dementia, decreased mentation or other encephalopathic signs and symptoms which would
             interfere with the ability of the patient to comply with the protocol.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Antimetabolites.

          -  Alkylating agents.

          -  Nucleoside analogs (excluding selected anti-retroviral agents).

          -  Imipenem-cilastatin.

          -  Interferons.

          -  Selected cytokines.

          -  Acyclovir (except topical acyclovir).

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Have only peripheral CMV retinitis (defined as a lesion outside the major temporal
             vascular arcades, greater than 1500 microns from the optic disk or greater than 3000
             microns from the fovea).

          -  Concomitant conditions or diseases described in Exclusion Co-Existing Conditions.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 1 month of study entry:

          -  Previous treatment with anti-cytomegalovirus therapy (e.g., ganciclovir, foscarnet or
             CMV hyperimmune globulin).
