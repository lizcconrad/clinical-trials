      Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Involved-field irradiation
      using 4-15 MV photons; plus Gemcitabine, NSC-613327.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a Phase I trial of gemcitabine given weekly as a 30 minute infusion administered
      concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent pancreatic
      carcinoma. Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard
      manner. Gemcitabine will be administered as a 30 minute infusion beginning on the first day
      of irradiation and weekly afterwards for a total of 5 doses. Patients will be assessed
      clinically for acute toxicity which will be graded per RTOG and DCT toxicity grading system.
