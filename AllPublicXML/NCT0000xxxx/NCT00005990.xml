      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 plus topotecan in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of R115777 and topotecan in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine pharmacokinetic profiles of topotecan alone and in combination with R115777 in
           these patients.

        -  Measure the inhibition of ras-farnesylation and topo-1 inhibition in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells in these patients when treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine activity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 2-21 (in the first course only R115777
      begins on day 3) and topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21. Treatment continues every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of R115777 and topotecan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
