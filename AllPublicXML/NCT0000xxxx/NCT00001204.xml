  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare inherited disease of metabolism. It occurs
      in less than 1 in 1 million people within the United States. Patients with the disease are
      typically children and young adults who develop heart disease early in life. Children less
      than age 5 years with this disease have suffered heart attacks and death.

      The normal process that removes cholesterol particles from the blood stream does not work in
      patients with this disease. It causes cholesterol to build-up in the arteries and leads to
      hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).

      The goal of this study is to detect and measure atherosclerosis in these patients before it
      becomes permanent and potentially life threatening. Patients with this disease can
      participate in this study. Researchers plan to evaluate patients with homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia using new and standard methods for detecting atherosclerosis.

      Researchers plan to use information gathered during this study to develop new, promising
      treatments such as liver transplantation and gene therapy.

    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal co-dominant disorder resulting in abnormal LDL
      receptor function, profoundly elevated concentrations of low density lipoproteins,
      accelerated atherosclerosis and death by early adulthood. This disease is heterogeneous in
      both the degree of LDL receptor dysfunction as well as the age of death. Liver
      transplantation has been demonstrated to virtually normalize plasma lipoprotein
      concentrations in homozygous FH and the recent cloning of a functional LDL receptor gene
      holds promise in the definitive treatment of this condition. We propose performing
      longitudinal sequential cardiologic studies utilizing noninvasive techniques in homozygous
      patients with well-characterized LDL receptor defects. Sequential cardiovascular study of
      these patients will not only characterize the progression of atherosclerosis heart disease in
      this disease, it may also permit the identification of individuals with would be likely to
      benefit from liver transplantation and/or genetic engineering.
