      Patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy and who report pain and fatigue
      at intake in the past 24 hours or at a level 2 or higher of pain or fatigue at a 3 or higher
      on a 10-point scale will be assigned randomly to an 8-week, 6-contact self management
      attention control (SMAC) intervention, or to a 8-week, 6-contact experimental patient
      intervention for management of symptoms and support (PIMSS) targeted toward symptom
      management, reducing impact on physical role and social functioning and emotional distress.
      Both groups will continue to receive conventional cancer care.

      When compared with the self-management attention control intervention, patients exposed to
      the experimental intervention will report statistically significant positive effects on the
      following:

        1. The primary outcome--total number of symptoms reported;

        2. The secondary patient outcomes--reduced deterioration in physical role impact and social
           functioning, emotional distress, levels of communication with caregiver about care, and
           communication and satisfaction with provider care; and

        3. Caregiver outcomes--greater involvement in symptom management, increased mastery of the
           caregiving process, reduced levels of depression and burden.

      GOAL: The primary goal of this research is to test a symptom management intervention,
      delivered by nurses with special training, using a stepped-care approach targeted toward pain
      and fatigue, followed by fifteen other prevalent cancer symptoms. Second goals are to improve
      physical and social functioning, lower emotional distress, and improve communication with
      family caregiver in symptom management, and assist them to reduce their levels of depression
      and burden. This research is funded through a grant from the National Cancer Institutes, and
      builds upon the Family Care Research Team's program of supportive cancer-care research.

      OUTCOMES: This study tests a stepped-approach intervention to determine if it improves
      symptom outcomes, especially pain and fatigue. Secondary outcomes addressed by the
      intervention are physical role impact, social functioning, and emotional distress. These
      outcomes can have significant impact on patients and family caregivers' well-being as
      patients undergo chemotherapy. The shorter, more intense intervention corresponds to changes
      int he clinical management of cancer patient with more intense, shorter chemotherapy
      treatments; therefore, this intervention will be more easily translatable to the clinical
      setting.
