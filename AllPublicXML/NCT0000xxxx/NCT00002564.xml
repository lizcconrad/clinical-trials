      RATIONALE: Dietary fat may be involved in the growth of cancer cells. Restricting dietary fat
      may help fight cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of a low fat diet in treating
      postmenopausal women who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer that has been
      completely removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether dietary fat reduction will effectively prolong disease-free
      and overall survival in women surgically treated for early stage breast cancer who are
      receiving adjuvant therapy with or without either tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
      fluorouracil (CMF), doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC), fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF), or AC followed by paclitaxel. II. Evaluate whether differences
      in the lipid profile are associated with dietary group assignment and dietary fat.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, nodal
      status, ER status, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy. The first group receives intensive
      dietary intervention for reduction of total fat intake to 15% of calories, with repeated
      individual and group counseling sessions. The second group receives USDA/DHHS dietary
      guidelines and minimal intervention. All patients who are estrogen receptor positive receive
      concurrent therapy with tamoxifen; cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF)
      followed by tamoxifen; doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by tamoxifen;
      fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF) followed by tamoxifen; or AC,
      paclitaxel followed by tamoxifen. Patients are followed annually throughout the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,500 women will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven, invasive, localized carcinoma of the breast
        Stage I/II/IIIA disease, i.e.: Tumor confined to breast on clinical examination Overlying
        skin movable with respect to tumor Tumor movable in relation to underlying muscle and chest
        wall Bone scan and/or x-ray required to rule out bone metastases in cases of skeletal pain
        Tumor size requirements: No greater than 5 cm if lymph nodes are positive Greater than 1 cm
        if lymph nodes are negative Tumor definitively treated by one of the following procedures:
        Total mastectomy with axillary node dissection Segmental mastectomy with or without
        axillary node dissection and/or sentinel node biopsy followed by breast irradiation,
        provided: Surgical margins are histologically free of invasive or noninvasive tumor One
        additional resection allowed to obtain clear margins Total mastectomy required if clear
        margins are not obtained at second resection The following conditions exclude: Bilateral
        malignancy or any mass in the contralateral breast unless proven nonmalignant by biopsy
        Palpable lymph nodes in the contralateral axilla or probable supraclavicular or
        infraclavicular nodal involvement unless proven nonmalignant by biopsy 10 or more positive
        lymph nodes Inflammatory breast cancer Ulceration or erythema Infiltration of the skin or
        peau d'orange Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion should not be
        considered skin infiltration Satellite breast nodules Parasternal nodules Edema of the arm
        Hormone receptor status: Any estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status
        allowed ER assessment required PR assessment recommended Less than 365 days between
        definitive surgery and randomization

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 48 to 78 Sex: Female Menopausal status: Postmenopausal
        Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: At least 10 years (excluding breast
        cancer) Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,000/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic:
        Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL AST no greater than 60 IU/mL (or within 2 times normal)
        Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: No active cardiac disease that
        would preclude doxorubicin in patients assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin
        Other: Baseline caloric intake at least 20% fat Accessible for follow-up and by telephone
        Sufficient memory required to provide food recall data Must speak and read English
        Medically and nutritionally eligible for either dietary intervention arm No prior or
        concomitant malignancy except curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
        situ of the cervix

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No concurrent participation in another adjuvant breast cancer
        trial that has disease-free or overall survival as a study endpoint (e.g., a major
        cooperative group trial) Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: Concurrent adjuvant
        cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF), doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC), AC
        followed by paclitaxel, or fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF) allowed If
        ER negative, approved chemotherapy regimen and/or tamoxifen required No more than 120 days
        between definitive surgery and initiation of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy Endocrine
        therapy: Concurrent adjuvant tamoxifen required if ER positive (if ER negative, tamoxifen
        and/or an approved chemotherapy regimen required) No more than 180 days between definitive
        surgery and initiation of tamoxifen (if receiving tamoxifen alone) If receiving adjuvant
        CMF, AC, or FAC, CAF, or AC, paclitaxel, tamoxifen begins after completion of adjuvant
        therapy Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy required within 56 days following segmental mastectomy
        Surgery: Definitive surgery required Prior oophorectomy for reasons other than malignancy
        allowed
