  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare virus response to GW433908/ritonavir (RTV) to viral
      response to nelfinavir (NFV) when used with abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) in patients that
      have not taken antiretroviral (ART) drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. One arm is treated with GW433908/RTV plus
      ABC and 3TC. The other is treated with NFV plus ABC and 3TC. Each group is treated for 48
      weeks. The following are compared in the 2 arms: 1) magnitude and durability of antiviral
      response; 2) safety, tolerance, and antiviral response after 24 and 48 weeks of therapy; 3)
      time to treatment failure; 4) immunologic response; 5) occurrence of events related to
      metabolic abnormalities; and 6) development of viral resistance in a subset of patients
      following treatment. Also studied are: 1) steady-state plasma drug trough concentrations; 2)
      demographic, virologic, immunologic, pharmacologic, and adherence factors that may be
      associated with treatment outcome; 3) patient adherence to the drug regimens; 4) study
      medication utilization; and 5) resource utilization.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are at least 13 years old (consent of parent or guardian needed if under 18).

          -  Agree to use a proven barrier method of birth control (e.g., spermicide plus condom)
             during the study period (hormonal birth control will not be accepted), if able to have
             children.

          -  Have received less than 4 weeks treatment with any nucleoside reverse transcriptase
             inhibitor (NRTI) and have never received any nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
             inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI). Mothers who have previously received 1
             dose of the NNRTI nevirapine during pregnancy for prevention of mother-to-child HIV
             transmission are permitted to enter the study.

          -  Have a viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) of 1,000 copies/ml or more.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol in a way that would interfere with study requirements. Patients
             who are stable on methadone will be considered for the study.

          -  Have an active/acute CDC Category C event.

          -  Are unable to absorb or take medicines by mouth.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Have a serious medical condition (such as diabetes, heart problem, hepatitis) that
             might affect the safety of the patient.

          -  Have had pancreatitis or hepatitis within the last 6 months.

          -  Have been treated with radiation or chemotherapy within 28 days before the study drug
             will be taken, or will have the need for these during the study.

          -  Have taken drugs that affect the immune system (such as corticosteroids, interleukins,
             interferons) or that have anti-HIV activity (such as hydroxyurea or foscarnet) within
             28 days before the study drug will be taken.

          -  Have received an HIV vaccine within 3 months before the study drug will be taken.

          -  Have received certain other drugs within 28 days before the study drug will be taken,
             or think that they will be needed during the study.

          -  Have received experimental treatments.

          -  Have allergies which might interfere with the study, in the opinion of the doctor.
