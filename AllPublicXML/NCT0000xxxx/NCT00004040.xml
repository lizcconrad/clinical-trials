      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Biological
      therapies such as interferon alfa-2b use different ways to stimulate the immune system and
      stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab or interferon alfa-2b in
      treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma in remission.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of rituximab or interferon alfa-2b maintenance therapy
      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma in remission after
      chemotherapy. II. Determine the progression free survival, failure free survival, and overall
      survival of these patients from time of chemotherapy discontinuation to completion of
      maintenance therapy. III. Compare the survival rates of these patients to similar patients
      treated in published studies. IV. Determine the quality of life of these patients on these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients enter one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive rituximab IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for course 1, and then once a month for 11 months or until disease
      progression. Arm II: Patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b every other day three
      times per week for 12 months. Quality of life is assessed monthly during therapy. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-80 patients (30-40 per disease type) will be accrued for
      this study.
