  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of combining zidovudine (AZT) and interferon
      alfa-2a (IFN-A2a) in a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients who have AIDS. It is
      hoped with the present study to define the rate at which the treatment affects the tumors and
      also to assess any toxic effects of the combination treatment over a period of time.

      In a recent study, the combination of IFN-A2a and AZT in the treatment of patients with
      AIDS-associated KS was evaluated and safe doses of both AZT and IFN-A2a were determined. In
      addition, it appeared that there was a substantial reduction in KS lesions with this therapy.
      Potential benefits of this combined therapy include resolution of KS lesions, prolonged
      survival, a decrease in the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections, improvement
      in CD4 cells, and a decrease in serum p24 antigens.

      In a recent study, the combination of IFN-A2a and AZT in the treatment of patients with
      AIDS-associated KS was evaluated and safe doses of both AZT and IFN-A2a were determined. In
      addition, it appeared that there was a substantial reduction in KS lesions with this therapy.
      Potential benefits of this combined therapy include resolution of KS lesions, prolonged
      survival, a decrease in the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections, improvement
      in CD4 cells, and a decrease in serum p24 antigens.

      Following evaluation studies, patients who participate in the study receive IFN-A2a and AZT.
      IFN-A2a is administered as a single subcutaneous injection once a day. AZT is given in a
      single capsule every 4 hours through the day for a total of six capsules. The first phase of
      treatment continues for 8 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, during which time AZT only
      is given. Subjects who have had an interruption in interferon during the first 8 weeks of the
      study for a toxicity may skip the rest period. Patients experiencing a complete response will
      be placed on maintenance therapy. Patients without progression of their KS can continue on
      the treatment of AZT and IFN-A2a until a complete response is obtained or until study is
      terminated, whichever comes first. Patients with complete anti-tumor response can continue on
      a maintenance phase, in which they receive IFN-A2a as a single injection 3 times a week on
      nonconsecutive days and a single capsule of AZT q4h 6 x /day until the study is terminated on
      February 1, 1992. Patients are required to visit the clinic weekly for the first 12 weeks
      (except during the week 9 rest period), every other week for the next 8 weeks, every month
      for up to 52 weeks of the study and every 3 months thereafter. Throughout the study, frequent
      blood samples will be taken to monitor the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Inhalation pentamidine for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) at a
             dose of 300 mg once every 4 weeks.

          -  AMENDED: Trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole or dapsone only if on the maintenance phase
             of the study.

        Allowed:

          -  Blood transfusions.

        Patients must have a positive antibody to HIV by any federally licensed ELISA test. All lab
        tests must be within 7 days of entry into the study.
