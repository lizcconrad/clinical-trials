  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased skeletal muscle mass is a prevalent condition among the elderly, and an important
      cause of disability and functional decline. The declines in muscle mass associated with aging
      may be related to alterations in specific kinds of growth factors in the muscle. Elderly hip
      fracture patients often have significant decreases in muscle mass. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate whether an exercise program can induce changes in muscle growth factors
      that are associated with increases in muscle mass and strength in elderly hip fracture
      patients.
