  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if treatment of MAC infection in HIV-1 infected persons is associated with the
      decreases in plasma levels of TNF-alpha.

      Infection with MAC is a poor prognostic indicator in persons with AIDS. Evidence suggests
      that this poor outcome is not simply a reflection of greater immune impairment in AIDS
      patients with MAC infection, but rather may be a direct or indirect consequence of infection
      with mycobacterium. Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC.
      Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly
      the survival of AIDS patients without MAC. Treatment of MAC with clarithromycin containing
      regimens is associated with decreased symptoms and prolonged survival. There is evidence,
      however, that mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation of the human immunodeficiency
      virus through mechanisms that may involve enhanced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines.
      It is unclear to what extent cytokine abnormalities contribute to this symptom complex and to
      what extent treatment of MAC infection will reverse these cytokine abnormalities.

      what extent treatment of MAC infection will reverse these cytokine abnormalities.

      All patients diagnosed with MAC and who will initiate at least a 2 drug clarithromycin
      containing MAC treatment regimen will be eligible for participation. Blood and urine will be
      obtained from each patient at the following timepoints: Pre-Entry (within 7 days prior to
      study entry), week 4, and week 8. Sites will process and ship specific samples to Case
      Western Reserve University (CWRU). Various assays and analyses will be performed by CWRU.
      NOTE: Patients will receive no treatment on this study, however, all patients must be
      receiving at least a 2 drug clarithromycin containing treatment regimen for MAC either as
      part of participation in other studies or as prescribed by the subject's health care
      provider.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Patients should have successfully completed therapy or be on stable therapy for any
             acute infectious processes other than MAC prior to study entry.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Either symptomatic MAC disease as defined by a history of clinical signs and symptoms,
             plus one blood culture positive for MAC or AFB obtained within the previous 90 days,
             OR asymptomatic MAC disease as defined by 2 blood cultures positive for MAC or AFB
             obtained within 90 days of entry.

          -  Signed parental consent for patients less than 18 years of age.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Patients who have received presumptive or empiric antimycobacterial therapy prior to
             study entry may be enrolled if they have been treated for no more than 72 hours prior
             to study entry.

          -  Patients who have been receiving prophylaxis with azithromycin, clarithromycin and/or
             rifabutin may be enrolled.

          -  Patients should have successfully completed therapy or be on stable therapy for any
             acute infectious processes other than MAC prior to study entry.

        Required:

          -  Patients must be on a stable antiretroviral regimen (same drug or combination drugs;
             dose modifications allowed) for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients will be requested NOT to modify or add new drugs to their stable ARV regimen
             for the duration of this study. Patients who absolutely require ARV changes at any
             time prior to week 8 will continue on study, however, their data will be analyzed
