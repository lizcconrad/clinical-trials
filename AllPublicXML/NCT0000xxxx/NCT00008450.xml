      This pilot clinical trial studies total-body irradiation followed by cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil in treating patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
      undergoing donor bone marrow transplant. Giving total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor
      bone marrow transplant using stem cells that closely match the patient's stem cells, helps
      stop the growth of abnormal cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from
      rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may mix with the patient's immune
      cells and help destroy any remaining abnormal cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine
      and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To safely establish partial lymphoid chimerism (1-95% donor cluster of differentiation
      [CD]3+ cells) using a non-lethal conditioning regimen in patients with severe combined
      immunodeficiency syndrome.

      II. To define the kinetics of immune reconstitution following a non-lethal conditioning
      regimen in patients with immunodeficiency diseases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) on days -3 to 100 followed by
      a taper until day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV on days 0-40 with a taper until day
      96 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Unrelated donor recipients also undergo TBI on
      day 0. Patients undergo bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then yearly for
      5 years.

                    -  Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency

          -  DONOR: Related donor who is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypically identical at
             least at one haplotype and may be genotypically or phenotypically identical for
             serological typing for HLA-A, B, C, and at the allele level for DRB1 and DQB1; related
             donors other than siblings must be matched at HLA-A, B, and C (at highest resolution
             available at the time of donor selection) and at DRB1 and DQB1 by deoxyribonucleic
             acid (DNA) typing; if more than one HLA-identical sibling is available, priority will
             be given to the oldest normal donor

          -  DONOR: Unrelated donors who are prospectively matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1
             by DNA typing at the highest resolution routinely available at the time of donor
             selection; only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as
             defined by high resolution typing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft
             rejection vector are considered a two-HLA allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is
             A*0201, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  DONOR: &lt; 6 months old, &gt; 75 years old
