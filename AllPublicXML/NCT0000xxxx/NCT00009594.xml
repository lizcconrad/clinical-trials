  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are characterized by pain and tenderness in the muscles of
      mastication and/or the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), limitations of jaw opening often
      accompanied by deviations in mandibular path, and clicking, popping or grating TMJ sounds.

      TMD is often found in association with other problems: depression, anxiety, sleep
      disturbances, gastrointestinal symptoms, frequent infections, etc. This project proposes to
      holistically address patient symptoms through three different approaches, Naturopathic
      Medicine (NM), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and usual care at KPNW. We will conduct a
      pilot test and Phase II trial to evaluate the two alternative healing approaches, TCM (n=50)
      and NM (n=50) delivered by TCM and NM practitioners, are as effective as usual TMD care
      (n=50) provided by dental clinicians in the KPNW TMD Clinic. Subjects will be females 25-55
      years of age with multiple health problems (defined as patients who have had at least 4 organ
      system-grouped diagnoses in the past year, not including TMD). Subjects will be evaluated at
      baseline, 6 and 12 months after start of treatment. The primary endpoint is change from
      baseline in the Axis II Pain Related Disability and Psychological Status Scale. Clinical
      examinations, saliva samples to assess salivary cortisol levels, and responses to a series of
      questionnaires to assess pain, chronic pain, psychosocial functioning, and other physical
      symptoms will be used to assess outcomes. We will passively monitor health care utilization
      within KPNW using clinical, research, and administrative databases to determine whether the
      interventions have an impact on overall health care utilization. If either of these
      alternative interventions is shown to merit Phase III trial, our goal is to design and
      implement such a clinical trial to further evaluate the health consequences and costs of
      these alternative healing paradigms.
