      PRIMARY: To evaluate the short-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine versus MF59 placebo
      administered to HIV-infected pregnant women.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate the immunogenicity and long-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in
      HIV-infected pregnant women who received the vaccine during pregnancy only or during
      pregnancy and postpartum. To evaluate immunogenicity and safety in the infant through 18
      months of age following maternal immunization with the vaccine during pregnancy.

      Active immunization of HIV-infected women during pregnancy may slow the progression of
      maternal disease, reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma, and increase the titer of
      epitope-specific antibody. Also, active immunization has the potential to induce primary
      immunity in the fetus and to boost both T-cell and humoral immune responses to HIV in the
      mothers.

      Active immunization of HIV-infected women during pregnancy may slow the progression of
      maternal disease, reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma, and increase the titer of
      epitope-specific antibody. Also, active immunization has the potential to induce primary
      immunity in the fetus and to boost both T-cell and humoral immune responses to HIV in the
      mothers.

      Women are randomized to receive rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine or MF59 placebo. Patients receive the
      first immunization between 16 and 24 weeks gestation and monthly thereafter until delivery,
      for a maximum of five immunizations. Patients may continue to receive the immunization
      regimen to which they were originally assigned at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Maternal
      follow-up continues until 18 months postpartum; infants are followed until age 18 months.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed during pregnancy:

          -  AZT.

          -  Methadone maintenance.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients may not initiate antiretroviral therapy for disease progression.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients may change from AZT to another antiretroviral agent or may begin
             antiretroviral therapy following delivery, if clinically indicated.

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3 (average of two determinations obtained 1 week apart).

          -  No clinical criteria for a diagnosis of AIDS.

          -  HIV p24 antigen &lt;= 30 pg/ml.

          -  Estimated gestational age between 16 and 24 weeks, confirmed by baseline sonogram that
             does not demonstrate any congenital abnormalities considered to be incompatible with
             life.

          -  Intention to carry pregnancy to term.

          -  Willingness to be followed by an ACTU for the duration of the study.

        NOTE:

          -  Father of the fetus (if available after a reasonable attempt to contact him) must
             provide informed consent.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  AZT.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to a component of the vaccine.

          -  Hepatitis B antigen positive at study entry.

          -  Evidence of life-threatening or other serious pre-existing fetal abnormalities (e.g.,
             anencephaly, renal agenesis, Potter's syndrome).

          -  Evidence of syphilis that requires therapy during this pregnancy.

          -  Intention to breast-feed.

        Presence of obstetrical high-risk factors such as:

          -  hypertension requiring the use of anti-hypertensive therapy

          -  repeated intrauterine fetal demise

          -  Rh-sensitization or other blood group alloimmunization

          -  diseases requiring use of immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., asthma, lupus).

        Excluded during pregnancy:

          -  Antiretrovirals other than AZT.

          -  Immunomodulating agents (e.g., HIVIG, IVIG).

          -  Other investigational drugs or immunosuppressive agents.
