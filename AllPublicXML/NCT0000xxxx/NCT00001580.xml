  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquisition of fresh tumor and normal tissue samples are necessary for the preparation of
      cDNA libraries, microarray chips, and tissue specific probes, and proteomics development and
      validation. This protocol will allow acquisition of samples at the time of tissue sampling
      for surgery, diagnostic tests, or therapeutic phereses. These samples will be forwarded
      without patient identifiers, pathology reports, or other labels. Tissue pathology will be
      verified within the Laboratory of Pathology and samples used strictly for CGAP and Proteomic
      Initiative indications.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients willing to sign the informed consent for whom tissue, blood or body fluids
        will be available are eligible.

        Histopathologic diagnosis will be confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer
