  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of Retrovir (AZT) in the treatment of psoriasis in HIV antibody
      positive patients. Retrovir has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AIDS. In
      addition, the administration of AZT appears to have induced a remission of psoriasis in one
      case study. In light of AZT's antiviral activity and potential effectiveness as an agent for
      the treatment of psoriasis, this would be the most likely treatment for HIV positive,
      psoriatic patients whose disease progresses quickly.

        (Biopsy-proven Reiter's syndrome patients with 3 distinct cutaneous lesions may be
        included.) Documented HIV antibody (by federally licensed ELISA test) positive patients.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Presence of any active opportunistic infection.

          -  Presence of any AIDS-defining neoplasms (excluding Kaposi's sarcoma) such as central
             nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Impaired renal function.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Impaired renal function.

          -  Significant hepatic dysfunction.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other antiretroviral agents (e.g., suramin, ribavirin, HPA-23, dideoxycytidine).

          -  Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry:

          -  Topical steroid, anthralin, or tar preparations.

          -  Cytolytic chemotherapy.

          -  Drugs which cause significant nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity.

          -  Rifampin or rifampin derivatives.

          -  Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:

          -  Etretinate, methotrexate, or psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy.

          -  Excluded within 8 weeks of study entry:

          -  Immunomodulating agents, including steroids, interferon, Isoprinosine, and interleukin
