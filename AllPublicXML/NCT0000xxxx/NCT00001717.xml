  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol seeks to better understand the various factors which influence an HIV infected
      individual's decision to participate in clinical research, and especially how the offer of
      payment influences the decision to participate and understanding of the risks, benefits and
      purpose of the research. Subjects will be HIV infected individuals participating in or being
      screened for participation in intramural HIV studies being conducted by the NIAID, CCMD, and
      NCI. Willing subjects will be recruited from studies that offer payment and comparable
      studies that do not pay. The primary methodology is an interview via a survey schedule. Use
      of the interview schedule will be preceded by a focus group of about 7-10 individuals and
      pretesting of the survey instrument. Paid and unpaid subjects will be compared with respect
      to motivations, understanding, willingness to withdraw, and sociodemographics.
