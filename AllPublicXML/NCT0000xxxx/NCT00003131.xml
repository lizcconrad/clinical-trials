      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CMA-676 in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia in first relapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of CMA-676 in terms of the number of patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia attaining a complete remission. II. Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive CMA-676 IV
      over 2 hours on day 1. Patients may receive 1 additional dose of therapy 15 to 28 days later.
      Patients who achieve complete or morphologic remission are followed for an additional 6
      months and every 3-6 months thereafter until relapse and/or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 55 evaluable patients will be accrued. Enrollment will then be extended
      for up to an additional 55 patients.
