      To assess the efficacy of Retrovir (AZT) therapy in the treatment of HIV Ab positive persons
      with impairments in neuropsychological functioning. To assess the safety, virologic, and
      immunologic effects of AZT therapy in HIV Ab positive persons with neuropsychological
      impairment but minimal other symptomatology.
