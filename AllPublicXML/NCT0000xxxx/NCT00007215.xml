  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a newly developed instrument called dynamic light scattering device (DLS)
      to examine age-related changes in the human lens and to study the causes and development of
      cataracts. DLS uses a low intensity laser light (similar to that used in supermarket
      checkouts) to measures lens cloudiness. It detects changes in the human lens at the earliest
      stages, when anti-cataract treatment would be most effective in reversing, delaying or
      preventing cataract formation.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with cataracts and normal volunteers between the ages of
      18 and 70 years may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a standard eye
      examination, including a vision check, pressure measurement, lens examination using DLS and
      examination of the retina. Photographs of the lens or retina, or both, may be taken.

      This study does not involve treatment. No anti-cataract medications will be given.

    <textblock>
      Recently, a device has been created to determine molecular interactions that occur in the
      nucleus of the lens, called Dynamic Light Scattering Device (DLS). Preliminary studies have
      shown its potential in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in cataract, at the
      stage where anticataract treatment would theoretically be most effective in reversing,
      delaying or preventing cataracts. A new miniaturized version of this device has been
      developed by NASA using lower energy lasers and offered for further development and testing
      at the NEI. We recently conducted a pilot study to evaluate the usefulness and
      reproducibility of this instrument for quantitating lens changes, and found good
      reproducibility. We also determined that the most useful parameter to use is mean particle
      size derived from particle size distribution. We therefore propose to conduct a study on
      changes on the lens due to aging (age related changes), as well as on the three
      representative types of cataracts (nuclear, cortical and PSC).

        INCLUSION:

        Patients 18 years or older will be admitted to this study.

        There will be no gender or sex bias in the recruitment.

        Fifteen subjects (30 eyes) who are normal volunteers of either sex, 3 for each decade from
        18-70, will be recruited.

        These normal volunteers should have clear lenses with LOCS II clinical score for nuclear
        opalescence of 0.5 or less.

        Three patients (18 eyes) for each major type of cataract (nuclear, cortical and PSC), will
        be recruited also for evaluation with the DLS device.

        All 3 types of cataracts will be graded using the LOCS II system and will have a clinical
        score of at least one.

        EXCLUSION:

        Patients who have uveitis, glaucoma and who are thought to be at risk for an adverse
        reaction to pupil dilation, or have a history of allergic reaction to one of the dilating
        agents that will be used.
