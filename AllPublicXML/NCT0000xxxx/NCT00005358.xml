      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this multicenter, collaborative, prospective study, patients hospitalized with a
      myocardial infarction were enrolled from ten geographically dispersed centers. Five
      thrombogenic- related blood factors were quantitated, and formed the centerpiece of this
      study: 1) lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] - a quantitative genetic factor that contains apolipoprotein
      B, has a structural homology to plasminogen, interferes with intrinsic thrombolytic activity,
      and represents a crossover link in the thrombogenesis/atherogenesis hypothesis; 2) soluble
      fibrin - a system indicator of coagulation activity in the ongoing conversion of fibrinogen
      to insoluble fibrin strands; 3) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) - an important
      regulator of the fibrinolytic system, it interferes with intrinsic t-PA activity; 4)
      coagulation Factor VII -high levels lead to increased thrombogenesis and have been associated
      with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease; and- 5) von Willebrand factor - it binds to
      platelet glycoproteins, contributes to local thrombus formation, and it is elevated in
      patients at increased risk of coronary thrombosis.

      The primary analysis utilized a time-dependent survivors hip model (Cox regression) to
      determine the presence or absence of an association between one or more of these factors and
      subsequent thrombotic-related coronary events. Secondary objectives included: 1) to determine
      if there was a statistical association between the thrombogenic factors and conventional
      hematologic/lipid parameters, and to evaluate their interactions regarding coronary events;
      and 2) to determine if thrombogenic factors had uniform effects on coronary event rates
      across various subgroups.
