      The purpose of this study is to compare GW433908 and nelfinavir when each is given with
      abacavir and lamivudine to HIV patients who have not taken antiretroviral drugs.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized in a 2:1 scheme to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Group 1 receives GW433908
      plus abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC); Group 2 receives nelfinavir (NFV) plus ABC plus
      3TC. Patients undergo safety and efficacy assessments at the Screening Visit, Day 1 (Entry),
      and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter. A follow-up visit is
      performed 4 weeks after the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Detailed assessments for
      the development of lipodystrophy/fat redistribution occur at Day 1, Week 24, Week 48, and
      every 16 weeks thereafter. Patients have examinations and laboratory tests performed at
      visits.
