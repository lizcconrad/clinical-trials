    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give tucaresol to HIV-infected patients
      who are taking combination anti-HIV therapy (HAART). This study also examines the effect
      tucaresol has on viral load (level of HIV in the body) when tucaresol is used with HAART.

      Patients are enrolled sequentially into the next available dosage cohort. Each cohort
      receives a single dose of tucaresol, is observed for 2 weeks, and then receives 3
      alternate-day doses of drug and careful safety monitoring, including 4 weeks follow-up after
      the final dose. Dose cohorts receive drug sequentially, the lowest-dose cohort receiving the
      drug first. Dose escalation may not proceed to the next higher-dose cohort until all patients
      from the prior lower-dose cohort have completed the 4-week follow-up after the multiple
      dosing, adverse events are within the described bounds, and the FDA has reviewed the safety
      information from the treated cohort and approved the dose escalation. The drug is
      administered 4 times within the 8 weeks of the study period. Weekly visits are required.
      Patients receive financial compensation.
