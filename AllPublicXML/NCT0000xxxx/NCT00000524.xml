      BACKGROUND:

      Heart failure due to myocarditis can be a devastating illness. At the same time,
      immunosuppressive therapy is associated with considerable risks of untoward side effects.
      Clinicians did not know whether, under what circumstances, or in what form, this hazardous
      treatment should be used in such critically ill patients. In addition, if immunosuppressive
      therapy was of benefit, then endomyocardial biopsy in patients suspected of having
      myocarditis was a justified procedure. The trial also provided information concerning the
      side effects of immuno-suppressive therapy in such patients.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients were randomized into two treatment arms consisting of conventional therapy alone for
      congestive heart failure or combined with a twenty-four week regimen of immunosuppressive
      therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of prednisone with either cyclosporine or
      azathioprine. The primary outcome measure was a change in the left ventricular ejection
      fraction at twenty-eight weeks. Secondary endpoints included survival, failures of therapy,
      requirements for conventional therapy, assessments of symptoms, myocardial histology, and
      arrhythmias.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)
      System.
