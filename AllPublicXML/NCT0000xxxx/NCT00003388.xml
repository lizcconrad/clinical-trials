      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      liposomal doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone in treating patients
      with AIDS-related lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the one year survival and complete response rate of patients treated
      with doxorubicin HCl liposome/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone (Doxil-CVP) for
      AIDS-related lymphoma. II. Evaluate the toxicity of a combination chemotherapy regimen,
      Doxil-CVP, in this patient population. III. Evaluate the progression free and overall
      survival after treatment with Doxil-CVP in this patient population. IV. Evaluate the effects
      of treatment with Doxil-CVP on plasma viral mRNA levels, CD4+ lymphocyte count, and the
      incidences and types of opportunistic infections in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics. All patients receive a
      30 minute infusion of doxorubicin HCl liposome IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and vincristine IV on
      day 1. Patients also receive oral prednisone on days 1-5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered
      subcutaneously starting on day 6 and continues until the absolute neutrophil count is at
      least 10,000/mm3. Treatment courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients with lymphomatous
      bone marrow involvement and/or category J lymphoma receive cytarabine and methotrexate
      intrathecally weekly for 4 weeks. Patients with lymphomatous meningitis receive whole brain
      irradiation and an alternating intrathecal chemotherapy regimen. A minimum of 4 and a maximum
      of 8 courses are administered. Patients are removed from the study for progressive disease,
      stable disease after 4 courses, a life threatening infection that would delay treatment for
      more than 6 weeks, or any delay, except due to neutropenia, in chemotherapy treatment for
      more than 6 weeks. Patients who achieve a complete response receive an additional 2 courses
      of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed AIDS-related
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the intermediate or high grade histologic types Anaplastic large
        cell lymphoma allowed Must be HIV positive Must have at least one objective measurable or
        evaluable disease parameter No parenchymal CNS involvement by lymphoma (meningeal lymphoma
        allowed) A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by
        PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
        terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses
        the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: (Except patients with lymphomatous marrow involvement) Absolute
        neutrophil count at least 1000/mm3 Platelet count at least 50,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no
        greater than 5.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine less than 3.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: Patients with
        history of heart disease, evidence of congestive heart failure, radiographic evidence of
        cardiomegaly, or electrocardiographic evidence of a prior myocardial infarction must have
        LVEF at least at lower limit of normal Neurologic: No grade 3 or greater peripheral
        neuropathy Other: No prior or concurrent malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma, curatively
        treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or curatively treated carcinoma
        in situ of the cervix Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective
        contraception No history of sensitivity to E. coli-derived proteins

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 5 days since interferon therapy
        Chemotherapy: No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy except for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma At
        least 12 months since cytotoxic chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma Endocrine therapy: Prior
        steroids allowed No concurrent steroid therapy greater than 5 mg prednisone (or equivalent)
        per day Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy except for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma
        Surgery: Not specified Other: No concurrent zidovudine (AZT) Concurrent antiretroviral
        medications other than AZT allowed
