      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the phenotypic heterogeneity of patients with genetic disorders
      including their clinical spectrum and natural history.

      II. Develop and evaluate novel methods for the treatment of genetic disorders including
      metabolic manipulation, enzyme manipulation, enzyme replacement, enzyme transplantation, and
      gene transfer techniques in these patients.

      III. Develop and evaluate methods for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders using
      improved cytogenetic, biochemical, and nucleic acid techniques and amniotic fluid cells or
      chorionic villi in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are evaluated annually or biannually, depending on disease status and progression.
      Patients undergo a complete medical history, an extensive family pedigree, and a physical
      examination. Patients undergo general laboratory, imaging, physiologic, and clinical
      laboratory studies according to their disease type. Patients undergo specialized laboratory
      studies including plasma and leukocyte enzyme assays, quantitative urinary
      mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, urine and plasma glycolipids, plasma and urine
      amino acids, urine organic acids, lymphoblastoid culture, DNA isolation from peripheral
      leukocytes, skin biopsy for fibroblast culture (if indicated), and medical photography.
      Patients also receive consultations with various specialties including ophthalmology, ENT,
      cardiology, pulmonary, gastroenterology/nutrition, hematology, neurology, orthopedics,
      rehabilitation medicine/physical therapy, and dermatology.
