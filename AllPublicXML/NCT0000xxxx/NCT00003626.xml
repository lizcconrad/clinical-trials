      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with hormone refractory
      prostate cancer treated with dolastatin 10. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a
      minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
