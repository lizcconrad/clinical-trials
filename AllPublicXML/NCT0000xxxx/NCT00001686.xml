      This protocol is designed to evaluate children with cancer who appear to be probable
      candidates for future protocol entry or have disease manifestations that are of unique
      scientific importance or educational value.

      Background:

      Children and adults are referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) for possible
      enrollment in clinical protocols for the treatment of cancer. While some children are not
      eligible for a specific protocol, they may present with disease manifestations that offer the
      potential for important new insights into the pathogenesis or clinical behavior of their
      underlying disease. In addition, children who have completed participation in a clinical
      protocol but do not currently have therapeutic protocol alternatives may continue to provide
      POB with important information. Diseases of interest to the POB include, but are not limited
      to lymphoma, brain tumors, Ewings sarcoma, leukemia, neuroectodermal tumors, osteosarcoma,
      and rhabdomyosarcoma. Hence, serial clinical evaluation of such patients, including the
      performance of clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic studies to help elucidate longitudinally
      the underlying disease mechanisms, and when clinically indicated standard care therapies,
      will assist POB meet its overall mission.

      Objectives:

      To be able to follow and evaluate children and adults with cancer or pre-cancer syndromes
      referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch who present with disease manifestations that lend
      themselves to clinical evaluation and are of unique scientific import.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are evaluated by the Pediatric Oncology Branch and are:

        -  Children and adults with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome), with disease manifestations
           of special interest to Pediatric Oncology Branch investigators.

        -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 years and less than or equal to 40 years of
           age at the time of study enrollment.

      Design:

      The medical procedures or tests will be selected for each patient on the basis of his/her
      individual diagnosis (or presumed diagnosis). When clinically indicated, standard therapy
      will be administered and patients will be followed according to standard medical practice.
      Specimens may be collected for clinical care purposes only to evaluate the patient s status.
      No investigational tests, drugs or therapies will be administered in this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A POB, CCR investigator decides that it is in the best interest of the patient and the
             POB, CCR for the patient to receive treatment and follow-up at the NCI/NIH.

          -  Children and adults with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome), between the age(s) of 2
             years - 40 years (the NIH CC is not well equipped to provide optimal care to patients
             &lt; 2 years of age). Note: Patients greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal
             to 40 years may be evaluated on this protocol if their cancer (or precancer syndrome)
             is of specific interest to the POB, CCR, NCI.

          -  Patients with cancer (or a pre-cancer syndrome), who present with disease
             manifestations of special interest to Pediatric Oncology Branch investigators,
             including but not limited to, lymphoma, brain tumors, Ewings sarcoma, leukemia,
             neuroectodermal tumors,

        osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma.

          -  Patient must weigh greater than or equal to 12 kg (the NIH CC is not well equipped to
             provide optimal care to patients &lt; 12 kg)

          -  The patient, parent, guardian or their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is able
             and willing to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients, and when indicated, parent, guardian or LAR who are deemed sufficiently
             reliable to return for recommended follow-up visits.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients younger than 2 years of age.

          -  Patients weighing less than or equal to 12 kg.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from enrollment onto this study because the invasive
             procedures and/or sedation needed to perform these may cause unnecessary harm to the
             unborn fetus. In the event a woman becomes pregnant while on study, she will not be
             removed from the study; however, no invasive clinical or research procedures will be
             done or cancer treatment provided that include unacceptable risk to the patient and/or
             to the unborn fetus.
