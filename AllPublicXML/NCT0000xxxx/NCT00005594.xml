      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ISIS 2503 in treating patients who have
      advanced cancer of the pancreas.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are treated with ISIS 2503. II. Determine the duration of
      response in these patients receiving this regimen. III. Characterize the safety profile of
      ISIS 2503 at the recommended phase II dose and schedule in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days. Treatment continues every 21
      days for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.

    <description>All patients will begin treatment at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day of ISIS 2503. ISIS 2503 at the assigned dose will be given as a continuous i.v. infusion over the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment cycle. No drug will be administered during the third week of each treatment cycle.</description>
