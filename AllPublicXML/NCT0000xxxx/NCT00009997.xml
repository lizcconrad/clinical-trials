  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination chemotherapy may be an effective
      treatment for locally advanced breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus paclitaxel followed by
      surgery and combination chemotherapy in treating women who have locally advanced breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of preoperative trastuzumab (Herceptin) and
      paclitaxel followed by postoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in women with locally
      advanced breast cancer with HER2 overexpression. II. Determine tumor response in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Assess the effect of this regimen on tumor histology
      and the potential molecular determinants of response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes followed by
      paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 7 days for a total of 10
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo a
      modified radical mastectomy or a lumpectomy with axillary node dissection. Beginning 14 days
      after surgery, patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses. After completion of
      chemotherapy, patients with hormone receptor-positive disease receive oral tamoxifen daily
      for 5 years. Patients are followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
