      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients with recurrent or
      refractory hematologic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate to compound 506U78
      (2-amino-9-b-D-arabinofuranosyl-6-methoxy-9H-purine) administered as a 1 hour infusion daily
      for 5 days in patients with recurrent T-cell malignancies.

      II. Determine the toxicities of compound 506U78 in this group of patients. III. Correlate the
      biochemical pharmacology of compound 506U78 (e.g., ara-G nucleotides in leukemic blasts and
      CSF concentrations) with clinical response.

      IV. Determine the impact of compound 506U78 therapy on survival and duration of response of
      patients with recurrent T-cell malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics: Group 1: T-cell ALL or
      NHL in first relapse (greater than 25% bone marrow blasts, with or without concomitant
      extramedullary relapse other than CNS); Group 2: T-cell ALL or NHL in second or later relapse
      (greater than 25% bone marrow blasts, with or without concomitant extramedullary relapse
      other than CNS); Group 3: T-cell ALL or NHL with positive bone marrow and CSF (greater than
      5% bone marrow blasts and CNS 2 or 3 involvement); Group 4: Extramedullary relapse and less
      than 25% blasts in the bone marrow (excluding isolated CNS relapse)

      GROUP 1: Patients receive a 1 hour infusion of compound 506U78 daily for 5 days in the
      absence of neurologic toxicity. The course repeats every 21 days. If a first relapse T-cell
      ALL study of higher priority is not open, then the patient may continue to receive the drug
      every 21 days for a maximum of 2 years provided that the patient has achieved a second
      complete response.

      GROUPS 2 and 4: Patients receive compound 506U78 every 21 days for a maximum of 2 years, in
      the absence of disease progression. After 3 courses a patient may be given CNS prophylaxis
      with triple intrathecal therapy (TIT), consisting of methotrexate, cytarabine and
      hydrocortisone after consultation with study coordinator. TIT should be given every 12 weeks.

      GROUP 3: Patients receive compound 506U78 every 21 days for a maximum of 2 years, in the
      absence of disease progression. TIT will be given on day 1 of weeks 1-4, 6, 9 and every 6
      weeks for 12 weeks, and then every 9 weeks thereafter. This stratum is open.
