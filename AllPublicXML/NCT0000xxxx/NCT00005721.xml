      BACKGROUND:

      The study continued research previously funded as part of a National Research and
      Demonstration Center (NRDC) in Transfusion Medicine.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      There were six components to the study. The first identified significant factors influencing
      regular blood donations by individuals with different donation histories - first-time,
      second-time, committed (frequent), and lapsed donors. The second component developed and
      assessed the validity of behavioral models to increase donor retention and to predict whether
      first and second time donors would contribute again. The third developed donor-retention
      interventions, especially for the first and second time donors. The fourth component
      identified homogeneous subgroups among first, second and committed donors who might be
      receptive to different types of intervention strategies to increase the frequency of their
      donations. The fifth component evaluated the success of cost-effectiveness of the new
      interventions compared to existing blood center maintenance strategies. The sixth identified
      whether or not donors had a limit or ceiling on how often they donated per year.

      The investigators drew on two related social psychological theories to combine cognitive and
      behavioral approaches to blood donor retention and to use the findings to construct a
      multiattribute model of donor decision-making. A behavioral decision model was used to
      predict donor behavior prospectively and to target and direct the design of interventions to
      increase donor retention and the frequency of donations.

      Approximately 33 percent of the total project supported the subproject on retaining donors.
