      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving monoclonal antibodies
      in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (In 111 MOAB
      Hu3S193) given intraperitoneally OR intravenously in patients with ovarian carcinoma. II.
      Compare the localization of In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 in ovarian cancer tissue after
      intraperitoneal vs intravenous injection. III. Compare the biodistribution and
      pharmacokinetics of this drug when administered intraperitoneally vs intravenously in these
      patients. IV. Determine the antibody response in these patients to this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms on a first come sequential basis. Arm
      I: Patients receive indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (In 111 MOAB Hu3S193)
      intraperitoneally over 30 minutes. Arm II: Patients receive In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30
      minutes. Patients undergo surgical debulking 3-7 days following In 111 MOAB Hu3S193
      administration, and biopsy samples are obtained to assess radioactive uptake.
      Immunohistochemistry is also performed. Blood samples are obtained to assess serum
      radioactivity. Whole body imaging is performed 3 hours after infusion of radiolabeled
      monoclonal antibody, on the day of surgery, and at one time point in between. Patients are
      followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
