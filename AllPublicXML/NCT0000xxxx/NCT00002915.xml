      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of penclomedine in treating patients who
      have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral penclomedine that can be
      administered daily for 5 days every 4 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumor
      malignancies. II. Describe and quantitate the toxic effects of penclomedine administered on
      this schedule in these patients. III. Study the clinical pharmacology and metabolism of
      penclomedine on this schedule, and seek pharmacodynamic correlates of pharmacologic
      parameters with clinical endpoints. IV. Study the bioavailability of oral penclomedine, and
      qualitatively compare metabolite profiles produced following oral and intravenous
      administration in these patients. V. Seek preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of
      penclomedine in patients with advanced cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      penclomedine. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses until the MTD is
      reached. Patients receive oral penclomedine for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. If tumor
      progression or unacceptable toxicity is documented during any treatment course, the patient
      is removed from study. A total of 10 patients will be treated at the dose determined to be
      the MTD (the recommended phase II dose).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 20 patients will be accrued over approximately 10 months.
