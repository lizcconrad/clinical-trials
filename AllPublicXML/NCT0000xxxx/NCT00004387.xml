      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of fetal nigral transplantation in patients with Parkinson's
      disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a placebo controlled, randomized, double blind study. Patients are
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. All patients receive 2 separate operations in
      which the substantia nigra from either 4 fetuses (Group A) or 1 fetus (Group C) is implanted
      into the striatum of each side.

      Group B patients receive 2 separate placebo operations without fetal transplantation.

      The second surgical procedure begins approximately 1 week after the first operation.

      After 2 years, treatments are compared. If transplant is shown to benefit Parkinson's
      disease, then patients who received placebo operation will be offered transplant surgery in
      the final year of the study.
