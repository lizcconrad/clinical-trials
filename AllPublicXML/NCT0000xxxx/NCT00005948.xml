      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune
      system and stop cancer cells from growing. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able
      to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral
      stem cell transplantation and biological therapy in treating patients who have chronic
      myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of high-dose busulfan followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      and sargramostim (GM-CSF) activated autologous/syngeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplantation, sequential IL-2 and GM-CSF therapy, and interferon alfa in patients with
      chronic myelogenous leukemia. II. Determine engraftment potential of IL-2/GM-CSF activated
      PBSC followed by sequential IL-2/GM-CSF therapy in this patient population. III. Assess the
      time to cytogenetic and/or morphologic relapse, overall event-free survival, and overall
      survival in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and activated with
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) and sargramostim (GM-CSF) on another protocol. Patients receive oral
      busulfan every 6 hours on days -6 to -3 for a total of 16 doses. IL-2 and GM-CSF-activated
      PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Beginning 4 hours after PBSC infusion, patients receive IL-2 IV
      continuously for 5 days followed by 2 days of rest for 4 weeks. In addition, GM-CSF is
      administered subcutaneously (SC) every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks. Upon
      hematologic recovery, but no earlier than 2 weeks after IL-2 and GM-CSF, patients receive
      interferon alfa SC 3 times weekly until clear evidence of disease progression. Patients are
      followed every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
