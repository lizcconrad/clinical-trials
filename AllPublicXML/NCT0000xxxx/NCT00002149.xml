  <brief_summary>

      To compare Traditional Chinese Medicine versus standard antibiotic therapy consisting of
      pseudoephedrine ( Sudafed ) plus amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium combination ( Augmentin
      ) in reducing symptoms and recurrence of acute HIV-related sinusitis.

      Chronic sinusitis in HIV-infected individuals is a recurrent and persistent infection with
      potentially serious complications: it can exacerbate pulmonary disease, cause recurrences of
      life-threatening sepsis, and progress to central nervous system involvement. Symptoms of
      sinusitis in HIV patients are often refractory to aggressive Western medical management, and
      antibiotic intolerance can occur. Traditional Chinese Medicine consisting of acupuncture and
      herbal treatment may provide a low-risk, low-cost alternative to conventional antibiotic
      therapy.

      Chronic sinusitis in HIV-infected individuals is a recurrent and persistent infection with
      potentially serious complications: it can exacerbate pulmonary disease, cause recurrences of
      life-threatening sepsis, and progress to central nervous system involvement. Symptoms of

      herbal treatment may provide a low-risk, low-cost alternative to conventional antibiotic
      therapy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either Traditional Chinese Medicine (acupuncture and
      herbal treatment) or conventional antibiotic therapy (Sudafed and Augmentin). Treatment
      continues for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 week washout, with final follow-up at week 12.
      Patients must undergo endoscopic nasal exam and CT scan of paranasal sinus prior to study
      entry and at week 12.
