      RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by the chemotherapy or radiation therapy that was used to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
      in treating patients who have multiple myeloma, chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia,
      or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following
           high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in patients with multiple myeloma,
           agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in first or second chronic
           phase.

        -  Determine the efficacy of BMT following busulfan and cyclophosphamide in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these preparative regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by remission (first vs second vs third).

      Patients who have not undergone prior radiotherapy receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and
      -5 and then undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 to -1. Allogeneic bone
      marrow is infused on day 0.

      Patients who have undergone prior radiotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7
      to -4 or -6 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic bone
      marrow is infused on day 0.

      Patients are followed at days 30 and 90, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
