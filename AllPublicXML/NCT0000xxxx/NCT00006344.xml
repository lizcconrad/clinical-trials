      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet
      known which regimen of radiation therapy may be more effective in preventing brain
      metastases.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in
      preventing brain metastases in patients who have small cell lung cancer that has been
      diagnosed within the past year.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of low dose versus high dose prophylactic cranial
      irradiation in preventing brain metastases in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung.
      II. Determine the neuropsychiatric status of these patients before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. The right or left hemisphere of each
      patient's brain are randomized to one of two treatment arms. All patients receive whole brain
      radiotherapy 5 days a week over 2.5 weeks for a total of 12 fractions. Arm I: Patients
      receive radiotherapy to the left cerebral hemisphere daily for 6 days immediately following
      completion of whole brain radiotherapy. Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy to the right
      cerebral hemisphere daily for 6 days immediately following completion of whole brain
      radiotherapy. Patients with extensive disease may also receive thoracic radiotherapy, if not
      administered previously. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-4
      years.
