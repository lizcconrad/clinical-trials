      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of UT-15 in patients with severe symptomatic primary
      pulmonary hypertension.

    <textblock>
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to center and etiology of disease.

      Patients receive conventional oral therapy plus a continuous subcutaneous infusion of either
      UT-15 or placebo for 12 weeks.

      After completing 12 weeks of treatment, patients may continue therapy with open label UT-15.
      Patients who received placebo cross over to receive UT-15.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Diagnosis of moderate to severe precapillary pulmonary hypertension (New York Heart
        Association class III/IV) unresponsive to attempted use of chronic oral vasodilators for at
        least 1 month

        Cardiac catheterization at baseline: Pulmonary artery pressure at least 25 mm Hg AND
        Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end diastolic pressure no greater
        than 15 mm Hg AND Pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 3 mm Hg/L/min

        Echocardiogram at baseline: Right ventricular hypertrophy or dilation AND Normal left
        ventricular function AND Absence of mitral valve stenosis

        Chest radiograph within prior 3 months Clear lung fields OR Multiple patchy interstitial
        (not diffuse) lung fields AND At least 1 of the following:

          -  Right ventricular enlargement

          -  Prominence of main pulmonary artery

          -  Enlarged hilar vessels

          -  Decreased peripheral vessels

        No significant parenchymal lung disease within prior 3 months as evidenced by: Total lung
        capacity no greater than 70% predicted FEV/FVC ratio no greater than 50% Diffuse
        interstitial fibrosis or alveolitis by high resolution CT if total lung capacity is 70-80%
        or DLCO less than 60%

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        Endocrine therapy:

          -  At least 30 days since prior chronic prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogue therapy
             (including Flolan IV)

          -  No concurrent prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogues

        Other:

          -  At least 1 month since prior new type of chronic therapy (e.g., different category of
             vasodilator, diuretic, digoxin) for pulmonary hypertension, except anticoagulants

          -  At least 1 week since discontinuation of prior pulmonary hypertension medication,
             except anticoagulants

          -  At least 30 days since prior participation in an investigational drug study

          -  No other concurrent investigational drug

          -  No concurrent chronic intravenous or inhaled medications (except oxygen)

        --Patient Characteristics--

        Cardiovascular:

          -  No portal hypertension

          -  No left sided heart disease as defined by: Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left
             ventricular end diastolic pressure greater than 15 mm Hg OR LVEF less than 40% by MUGA
             or angiography OR LV shortening fraction less than 22% by echocardiography OR
             Symptomatic coronary disease (demonstrable ischemia)

             schistosomiasis)

          -  No musculoskeletal disorder (arthritis, artificial leg, etc.) or any disease limiting
             ambulation, or connected to a nonportable machine
