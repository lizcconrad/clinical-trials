      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and carboplatin in
      treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of low dose docetaxel and carboplatin by response
      rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small
      cell lung cancer. II. Determine the side effects and toxicity profile of docetaxel when given
      in combination with carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is open label study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 4 weeks. Patients receive at least 2 courses
      (8 weeks) of treatment. Courses are further repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      and disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-38 patients accrued into this study.
