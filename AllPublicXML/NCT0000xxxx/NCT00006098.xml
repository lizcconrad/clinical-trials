      RATIONALE: PS-341 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have
      hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of PS-341 in
      patients with hematologic malignancies. II. Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in
      these patients. III. Determine response to this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the
      correlation between response of malignancies and proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of these patients. V. Determine the correlation
      between therapy toxicity and proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in PBMC of these patients.
      VI. Determine the effect of this drug on other molecular markers (i.e., BCL-2 in follicular
      lymphoma patients and t9;22/BCR/ABL in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients). VII. Determine
      the correlation between interleukin-6 serum levels in multiple myeloma patients and drug
      dosing, toxicity of therapy, extent of protease inhibition, response to therapy, and
      apoptosis in PBMC of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive PS-341 IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 followed by a 2-week rest. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
