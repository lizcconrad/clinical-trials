  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas, continuously synthesized by the endothelium, that
      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Although regional
      synthesis of NO by the endothelium contributes to local vasodilator tone, Stamler and
      co-workers have proposed that regional vascular tone may also be regulated by NO transported
      from the lungs by hemoglobin as a consequence of enhanced binding of NO to reactive thiols of
      oxygenated hemoglobin. This study is designed to determine the contribution of
      hemoglobin-transported NO to forearm microvascular dilator tone in healthy subjects at rest
      and during regional hypoxia associated with forearm exercise stress, with measurements made
      before and after regional blockade of endothelial NO synthesis. Findings in this study may be
      relevant to understanding the physiological contribution and therapeutic potential of
      hemoglobin-transported NO in the regulation of vasodilator tone in diseases and conditions
      associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity
      (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, and estrogen
      deficiency).

        All volunteer subjects must be between 21 and 75 years of age, in good health, and must
        have provided informed, written consent for participation in this study.

        No subjects with a history or evidence of present or past hypertension (blood pressure
        greater than 145/95 mmHg), hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dL),
        diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose greater than 120 mg/dL), smoking within 2 years,
        cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, or any other disease
        predisposing to vasculitis or Raynaud's phenomenon.

        No volunteer subject will be allowed to take any medication (oral contraceptive agents are
        allowed) or vitamin supplements for at least one month prior to study and will not be
        allowed to take aspirin for one week prior to study.

        Pregnancy testing will be required of all women of reproductive age to exclude current
        pregnancy.
