      RATIONALE: Suramin may stop the growth of bladder cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of suramin in treating patients who have
      recurrent bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of suramin in patients with recurrent
           superficial bladder cancer.

        -  Confirm that there is no significant systemic absorption of this drug when administered
           intravesically in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      At approximately 14-18 days after surgical resection of bladder tumor(s), patients receive
      intravesicular suramin via urethral catheter installation into the bladder over 2 hours
      weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of suramin until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      develop dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.
