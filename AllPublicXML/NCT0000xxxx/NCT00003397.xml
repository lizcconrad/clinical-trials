      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.
      Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of peripheral stem cell transplantation
      plus combination chemotherapy and rituximab in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the 1 and 2 year event free survival of patients with poor prognosis,
      relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who receive
      high dose carmustine and melphalan plus gemcitabine followed by rituximab (IDEC-C2B8
      monoclonal antibody; anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) plus sargramostim and consolidation
      chemotherapy with alternating dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/ etoposide/cisplatin plus
      gemcitabine and paclitaxel/cisplatin and compare these figures to a historical control
      population. II. Evaluate the ability of posttransplant rituximab therapy in combination with
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) to control and further treat residual lymphoma remaining after high
      dose therapy in these patients. III. Evaluate quality of life parameters and assess the risk
      of secondary malignancies following this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on day -5 and again
      approximately 6 hours after carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2. On day -1, patients receive
      melphalan IV over 20 minutes followed 24 hours later (day 0) with peripheral blood stem cells
      transplantation. Patients then receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day
      4 until granulocyte count is greater than 1,000/mm3 for 2 consecutive days. At weeks 5-8
      posttransplant, patients receive rituximab (IDEC-C2B8 monoclonal antibody; anti-CD20
      monoclonal antibody) IV over 3-4 hours weekly. Prior to rituximab treatment at week 4
      posttransplant, patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously 3 times a week
      continuing through rituximab therapy. At approximately 3 and 9 months posttransplant,
      patients receive dexamethasone orally every day for days 1-4, and cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide, and cisplatin by continuous infusion for 4 days (days 1-4), and gemcitabine IV
      over 100 minutes on days 1 and 5. At approximately 6 and 12 months posttransplant, patients
      receive paclitaxel IV over 6 hours on day 2 and cisplatin IV over 24 hours on day 3. Patients
      are followed at least every 6 weeks to 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 25 patients per year will be accrued into this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed intermediate or high grade B-cell
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that meets one of the following criteria: - Relapsed or progressed
        following at least 1 course of standard therapy - Developed from a low grade lymphoma
        regardless of remission status - In first complete response with 3 or more of the following
        pretreatment criteria met at the time of original diagnosis: Stage III/IV disease Two or
        more extranodal sites of disease Lactate dehydrogenase greater than 1.2 times normal
        Performance status 2-4 (at time of diagnosis) Dimension of the largest tumor at least 10 cm
        No myelodysplasia A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been
        adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the
        former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this
        protocol uses the former terminology.
