  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this protocol are to compare 3 and 6 months of naltrexone treatment coupled with
      two psychotherapies that differ in scope and intensity. The effect of these treatments will
      be assessed with patients who differ in their psychosocial need and resources at their
      disposal, and in their level of cravings for alcohol.
