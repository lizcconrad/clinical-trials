      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide plus topotecan in
      treating patients who have refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of cyclophosphamide followed by topotecan in patients
      with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. II. Confirm safety and tolerability
      of this combination on this schedule in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously over 1 hour on day 1 followed by
      topotecan as a continuous 120 hour infusion starting 12 hours after completion of
      cyclophosphamide. Treatment may be repeated every 3-6 weeks for at least 2 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
