      There are no guidelines for appropriate nutritional management of weight loss or wasting in
      HIV infection. Some treatments may increase weight, but without improving muscle mass or
      quality of life. In this clinical trial AIDS patients with wasting are randomized to one of
      three nutritional strategies and studied over a 12-week period: 1) optimal oral nutrition
      with counseling and protein and calorie supplementation, and a placebo pill; 2) optimal oral
      nutrition with the oral androgen, oxandrolone at 20 mg daily; and 3) optimal oral nutrition
      with progressive resistance training (PRT). In all participants, dietary intervention is
      maximized by weekly personalized counseling to address individual issues and concerns. Two
      primary outcomes are assessed: thigh muscle mass and quality of life. Our findings can be
      used to develop guidelines for standards of nutritional care among AIDS patient with the
      wasting syndrome.
