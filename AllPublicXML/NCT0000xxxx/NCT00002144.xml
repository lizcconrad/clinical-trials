      PRIMARY: To evaluate the clinical activity of foscarnet cream on the index lesion of
      mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in immunocompromised patients previously
      unresponsive to acyclovir treatment.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate the clinical activity and virologic activity of foscarnet cream on all
      treated lesions in this patient population. To evaluate the local tolerance and side effects
      of treatment with foscarnet cream in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive topical applications of one percent foscarnet cream five times daily for up
      to 6 weeks; those who show no evidence of epithelialization of the index lesion after 3 or
      more weeks are removed from study and offered intravenous foscarnet. Patients who show a good
      response to topical foscarnet cream at the end of 6 weeks may continue receiving treatment at
      the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Other medication considered necessary for patient's welfare, at the discretion of the
             investigator.

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV infection or AIDS.

          -  Mucocutaneous HSV infection with at least one clinically evaluable lesion.

          -  Prior acyclovir without clinical benefit.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Consent of parent or guardian if less than 18 years of age.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Intravenous foscarnet for current episode of HSV.

          -  Acyclovir, interferon, or any investigational drug that might have anti-HSV activity
             (e.g., 256U87, HPMPC, BVDaraU, trifluridine).

        Patients with the following prior condition are excluded:

        Previous participation in the study.
